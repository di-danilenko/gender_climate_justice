Given this prospect, a sea-level rise of 60 cm by 2100 has been assumed and adopted in French regulations related to coastal flooding. The accuracy of this working hypothesis is considered here by comparing the adopted value with projections recently produced by the IPCC. Based on this comparison, it can be concluded that the risk is currently underestimated. In addition, local sea-level changes can differ significantly from the global mean because of various spatial-dependant processes: gravitational and rotational effects influencing the redistribution of melting water from glaciers and ice sheets, dynamical steric effects affecting densities locally, and isostatic effects causing vertical land movements along coastlines. French overseas territories, which have a broad global distribution, will be adversly affected by this spatial variability. In the worst-case future climate change scenario - the one of most interest to decision-makers - sea-level would rise by less than 100 cm along the French Atlantic coast, compared to nearly 120 cm in Mayotte and La Reunion. Given the two issues raised above, it is recommended that the national regulations are revised in order to reflect the most recent projections provided by the IPCC. Considering that French overseas territories are more vulnerable to flooding and could experience a more significant sea-level rise than French metropolitan coasts, it is proposed also to consider regional working hypothesis.",2016.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Water Resources,Regional projections of Sea-level Rise in French Overseas Territories,Geography,Alberic,Alberic,0.0,0.0

Muell-Arg.) is the prime source of natural rubber. Domestication of rubber began since 1876 with Wickham collecting 70,000 seeds from Upper Amazon and transported them to Kew Botanic Gardens. Somehow, rubber trees covering millions of hectares are believed to be derived from ""22 seedlings"" of Wickham's original stock. Improving dry rubber yield is the exclusive and ultimate objective of Hevea breeding with consistent yield of 70 to 80 g/tree/tapping. Ultimately, in a small holding, a planter must gain an average yield of around 2200 to 2400 kg/ha from his stand (under optimal conditions), after accommodating tree-to-tree variations due to stock-scion interactions and soil heterogeneity. This is arduous, but achievable. Initial production of high-yielding clones gave 1600 kg/ha against 496 kg/ha of unselected seedlings. Adaptation and yielding potential of clones to specific environments are optimized through localized experimentation. Studies on adaptation of clones to new environments, especially to sub-optimal or marginal areas, are gaining momentum. As this extension happens, demand for new clones is on the rise. Possibilities of using rubber trees for reforestation, carbon sequestration and application of genomics in deriving climate resilient clones may come up in future, which breeders may have to take up with required priority. Five major methodologies followed are (a) primary clones and seed gardens, (b) derivation of recombinants and clone selection, (c) genetic analysis and variability management (d) early selection and estimation of genetic value and (e) application of genomics. Primary clones have immensely contributed in exploiting heterosis and production of new clones. For evaluation of recombinants, families are to be raised in closer spacing (2 or 3 m) and allowed to attain tappable girth for evaluation. While a normal breeding cycle takes 35 to 40 years, through skipping SSCTs and LSCTs, the scheme proposed can derive a clone in 17 years. Recent advances like transcriptome sequencing of bark and EST sequences generated from suppression subtractive hybridization-cDNA libraries could facilitate marker-assisted selection that could very well be used for selecting high-yielding genotypes at juvenile stage. Paternity identification can be done through breeding without breeding (BwB) in half-sibs and poly-cross (open pollinated) seedlings. Transcriptome studies have to come a long way to yield meaningful results to tag vivid genes responsible for QTLs, resistance and other quality traits, especially markers for cold/drought stress. It is opined that instead of subjecting plants for artificial cold/drought conditions, plants continuously exposed to such stress conditions must be used for analyses that can give a comprehensive indication of stress tolerance. The application of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique to simultaneously discover and delineate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers is a robust and cost-effective approach for generating a common set of genome-wide SNP data suitable for constructing integrated linkage maps from multiple populations. Studies on mitochondrial and chloroplast DNAs are welcome steps towards understanding ATP efficiency of accessions that need to be augmented further, so that clones with higher ATP efficiency can be used for breeding.

I propose that there is confusion in the biophysical ecologists' community about the role of knowledge, stemming from several already surpassed beliefs that have been strongly criticized by scholars in the field of science and technology studies. In particular, environmental scientists still often seem trapped in the information deficit model, assuming a linear and unidirectional flow of knowledge from experts to users. This leads to an incomplete understanding and unrealistic expectations of ongoing processes of citizen participation (co-production of knowledge), impatience regarding the speed at which issues can be dealt with by politics, and a fuzzy notion of the role of our convictions regarding the value of nature conservation when we are consulted as experts. I analyse the consequences of disregarding tacit knowledge, i.e. the one knowledge beyond that codified in academic papers and books. I emphasize that preferences and values have a large influence on how we perceive, process, and act (or postpone to act) on information on our non-exclusive roles as scientists, decision makers or citizens. I argue that this is why political and ideological preferences have a large influence not only on which teams are appointed to solve problems, but also on which situations are perceived as problematic and given higher priorities. I include a cheat-sheet to enhance communication with decision-makers and other non-scientists that could prevent environmental zeal to be transformed into society's annoyance and our eventual irrelevance. I plea for a more realistic attitude towards ecological research, highlighting that in environmental debates we are also long-term stakeholders, and not only casual, external and aseptic observers.

BSP) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) plantation productivity. The analytical approach consisted of calculating future values of growing season mean temperature and precipitation rates under three emissions scenarios (no change (NC); B1; and A2), spanning three continuous commitment periods (2011-2040; 2041-2070; and 2071-2100), for three geographically separated sites throughout the central portion of the Canadian Boreal Forest Region (north-eastern (Kirkland Lake); north-central (Thunder Bay); and north-western (Dryden) Ontario, Canada), using the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM3) in conjunction with a geographic-referencing climatic surface model. These estimates were entered into the embedded biophysical equations in the SSDMMs in order to forecast emission-scenario-specific developmental patterns of plantations managed under a conventional density management regime by species and site quality (poor-to-medium and good-to-excellent) at each locale; from which stand development rates and associated productivity metrics over 75 year-long rotations were estimated and compared (e.g., mean sizes, volumetric, biomass and carbon yields, end-products, economic worth, stand stability, wood quality indices, and operability status). Simulation results indicated that black spruce plantations situated on both site qualities at the north-western location and on the lower site quality at the north-eastern location were negatively affected from the predicted increased warming and rainfall as evidenced from consequential declines in stand development rates and resultant decreases in rotational mean sizes, biomass yields, recoverable end-product volumes, and economic worth (A2 > B1). Conversely, black spruce plantations situated on both site qualities at the north-central location and on the higher site quality at the north-eastern location were minimally and positively affected under the A2 and B1 scenarios, respectively. Jack pine plantations situated on both site qualities at all three locations were negatively affected as evident by the reductions in stand development rates and rotational mean sizes, biomass yields, recoverable end-product volumes, and economic worth (A2 > B1). Collectively, these response patterns suggest that stand-level productivity under a changing climate will vary by species, site quality, geographic locale, and emission scenario, potentially resulting in a landscape-level mosaic of both negative and positive productivity impacts in the case of black spruce, and mostly negative impacts in the case of jack pine. As demonstrated, modelling stand-level responses to projected increases in thermal and moisture regimes through the modification of existing stand-level forecasting models, and accounting for divergent effects due to species, site quality, and geographic locale differences, is a viable and efficient alternative approach for projecting productivity outcomes arising from anthropogenic-induced changes in growing conditions.",2016.0,MDPI,Forestry,Simulating the Potential Effects of a Changing Climate on Black Spruce and Jack Pine Plantation Productivity by Site Quality and Locale through Model Adaptation,Environmental studies & forestry,Peter F.,Peter,0.0,0.0

Adequate winter chill is an important site characteristic for commercial orchard operations, and quantifying chill is crucial for orchard management. Climate change may impact winter chill. With a view to adapting orchards to climate change, this review assesses the state of knowledge in modelling winter chill and the performance of various modelling approaches. It then goes on to present assessments of past and projected future changes in winter chill for fruit growing regions and discusses potential adaptation strategies. Some of the most common approaches to modelling chill, in particular the Chilling Hours approach, are very sensitive to temperature increases, and have also been found to perform poorly, especially in warm growing regions. The Dynamic Model offers a more complex but also more accurate alternative, and use of this model is recommended. Chill changes projected with the Dynamic Model are typically much less severe than those estimated with other models. Nevertheless, projections of future chill consistently indicate substantial losses for the warmest growing regions, while temperate regions will experience relatively little change, and cold regions may even see chill increases. Growers can adapt to lower chill by introducing low-chill cultivars, by influencing orchard microclimates and by applying rest-breaking chemicals. Given substantial knowledge gaps in tree dormancy, accurate models are still a long way off. Since timely adaptation is essential for growers of long-lived high-value perennials, alternative ways of adaptation planning are needed. Climate analogues, which are present-day manifestations of future projected climates, can be used for identifying and testing future-adapted species and cultivars. Horticultural researchers and practitioners should work towards the development and widespread adoption of better chill accumulation and dormancy models, for facilitating quantitatively appropriate adaptation planning.

Large fractions of this debt are carried by industrialized countries, but also by countries with high levels of deforestation and agriculture.

Vulnerability affects community participation in hazard mitigation, influences emergency response and governs adaptive capacity for the changing environmental and hazards characteristics. However, despite increased awareness, assessments and understanding of the processes that produce vulnerability, disaster risks prevail. This raises questions on the effectiveness of vulnerability assessments and their applications for hazard mitigation and adaptation.

It brings out the limitations of different vulnerability assessment methods in representing the local vulnerability and challenges they bring in planning for the vulnerability reduction.

23,"Kousky, Carolyn","Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC USA.",1.0,"We can expect climate change to alter the frequency, magnitude, timing, and location of many natural hazards. For example, heat waves are likely to become more frequent, and heavy downpours and flooding more common and more intense. Hurricanes will likely grow more dangerous, rising sea levels will mean more coastal flooding, and more-frequent and more intense droughts will produce more wildfires. Children, particularly the poor and those in developing countries, are at risk. Carolyn Kousky considers three ways that natural disasters may harm children disproportionately, often with long-lasting effects. First, disasters can damage children's physical health. Children may be injured or killed, but they may also suffer from such things as malnutrition caused by disruptions in food supply or diarrheal illness caused by contaminated water. Moreover, disasters can cut off access to medical care, even for non-disaster-related illnesses. Second, disasters can cause mental health problems. Not only are disasters themselves stressful and frightening, but children can suffer psychological harm from the damage to their homes and possessions; from migration; from the grief of losing loved ones; from seeing parents or caregivers undergo stress; from neglect and abuse; and from breakdowns in social networks, neighborhoods, and local economies. Third, disasters can interrupt children's education by displacing families, destroying schools, and pushing children into the labor force to help their families make ends meet in straitened times. How can we mitigate the dangers to children even as disasters become more powerful and more frequent? For one thing, we can prepare for disasters before they strike, for example, by strengthening school buildings and houses. Kousky also describes actions that have been proven to help children after a disaster, such as quickly reuniting them with parents and caregivers. Finally, a range of policies not designed for disasters can nonetheless help mitigate the harm disasters cause children and their families. In fact, Kousky writes, using existing safety net programs may be easier, faster, and more effective than creating entirely new programs after a disaster occurs.",2016.0,PRINCETON UNIV,Family Studies,Impacts of Natural Disasters on Children,Sociology,Carolyn,Carolyn,1.0,1.0

Three eucalypt species were analysed to demonstrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the method. These included a well-known commercially important species (Eucalyptus globulus), a lesser-known species (E. botryoides) and a rare species (E. kruseana). To provide a simple assessment of climatic adaptability the highest values of mean annual temperature were determined from within the potential ranges of the three species.

Applied thematic analysis surfaces issues of coordination, decision-making, resource constraints and tracking progress as key constraints to urban climate adaptation. Findings - While considerable progress has been made on developing a citywide climate adaptation plan for Cape Town, implementation is constrained by poor monitoring and feedback within and between departments and a lack of oversight and impetus from central authorities within the government hierarchy.

GOALS: To trace the historical origins of CEH; to identify factors responsible for its recent growth. FINDINGS: CEH has historical roots in toxicology, epidemiology, and occupational medicine. It arose in the second half of the 20th century through a melding of insights from pediatric toxicology, nutritional epidemiology, and social science research. Convergent research in these 3 fields has documented children's unique sensitivities to chemical, nutritional, and psychosocial hazards during windows of vulnerability in early development and has shown that early-life exposures can produce disease and disability in childhood and across the life span. Key events in the development of CEH were: 1) formation by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1957 of a committee on environmental health that has nurtured the growth of the field for 5 decades and evolved into the Council on Environmental Health; 2) observations made in the 1980s that nutritional deficiency in utero increased risk for adult-onset obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease work that led to the hypothesis of the developmental origins of health and disease; 3) social science research showing that early exposure to psychosocial stress and trauma increases risk for chronic illness; and 4) publication in 1993 by the National Academy of Sciences of a report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, which elevated awareness among national policy makers of children's vulnerability to toxic hazards, moved US environmental policy. toward protection of children's health, and catalyzed research investment in CEH in the United States and globally. CONCLUSIONS: CEH has made substantial progress but faces emerging challenges, including new chemicals and pesticides; increasing movement of polluting industries to poor countries where environmental and public health protections are few; and global climate change. In the future, CEH will require continued investment in research and education and will need to adopt an increasingly global perspective.",2016.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,Pediatrics,Children's Environmental Health: A Brief History,Medicine,Philip J.,Philip,0.0,0.0

Due to their initial poverty and their relatively high dependence on environmental capital for their livelihoods, the poor are likely to suffer most due to their low resources for mitigation and investment in adaptation. Economic growth is essential for any large-scale poverty reduction. Green growth, a growth process that is sensitive to environmental and climate change concerns, can be particularly helpful in this respect. We focus on the possible trade-offs between the greening of growth and poverty reduction, and we highlight the sectoral and spatial processes behind effective poverty reduction. High labor intensity, declining shares of agriculture in GDP and employment, migration, and urbanization are essential features of poverty-reducing growth. We contrast some common and stylized green-sensitive growth ideas related to agriculture, trade, technology, infrastructure, and urban development with the requirements of poverty-sensitive growth. We find that these ideas may cause a slow-down in the effectiveness of growth to reduce poverty. The main lesson is that trade-offs are bound to exist; they increase the social costs of green growth and should be explicitly addressed. If they are not addressed, green growth may not be good for the poor, and the poor should not be asked to pay the price for sustaining growth while greening the planet.",2014.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,Development Studies,Is Green Growth Good for the Poor?,Interdisciplinary,Stefan,Stefan,0.0,0.0

The sum of these factors should have caused significant shoreline recession, but instead the average shoreline position of this coast was stable during the early period from the 1800s to the 1970s (prior to beach nourishment) and strongly accretive from the 1800s to the 2000s. When the Bruun rule is used, shoreline change predicted by the sum of the factors compares poorly with measured data, but it compares quite well when the Dean equilibrium concept is used. The Dean equilibrium concept says that under wave action and with sufficient available offshore sand, shorelines will advance with sea-level rise due to onshore sand transport. Long-term shoreline change data for most of the Florida east coast and the Dutch central coast also support the Dean equilibrium concept.

Though experimental interventions that seek to engage communities have been implemented in a number of regions, most of these interventions stall after the experimental stage. This research utilised opportunities provided by a landmark intervention on Special Area Management in Negombo, Sri Lanka, to draw lessons for community-based interventions for climate change adaptation. Short term policy interventions can lead to irrevocable changes within complex socio-ecological systems, disintegrating identities and functions. Such systems become artificial, empty shells, losing their former richness and serenity. Tight social networks and bonds, which prevailed through centuries disappear, taking away the ability of communities to engage in collective action that allowed sustainable use of their common resource base. The resulting degradation of the natural resource base that form the livelihood of communities leads to further breaking down of the social network, driving this vicious cycle. It is clear that the Special Area Management (SAM) intervention in Negombo, Sri Lanka needs further improvement if it were to further the adaptive co-management approach, though the project that funded the intervention clearly expected to utilise this approach. The current national and provincial level institutional set up is not conducive for effective adaptive co-management. This is mainly due to conventional institutions adhering to governance regimes that are rigid and inflexible, and as such are not prepared to be adaptive through policy learning. It is also due to the fact that existing systems are not serious about community empowerment in the governance process. It is clear that any breakthrough allowing for an adaptive co-management kind of approach needs policy and institutional change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines economic and policy implications of incremental and transformational changes in production location by considering the net effects of shifting rice production from a southern area to the sugar dominated Burdekin area in northern Queensland, using a dynamic regional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Three rice transformational adaptation scenarios at two time points, 2030 and 2070, were considered. The results suggest a net reduction in real economic output and real income, although adopting a rice-sugarcane rotation in Burdekin could partly offset some of the negative impact. The displacement of sugar would result in a much larger net national loss and consequent net reduction in gross regional product (GRP). The study findings suggest that there is unlikely to be a rapid and spontaneous increase in rice production in the north, because of a lack of infrastructure, wariness in relation to the agronomic issues, the lower profits and the opportunity cost of turning away from sugar. Currently private investment in infrastructure can keep pace with the level of production, but a more rapid expansion would need access to government assistance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The empowerment of stakeholders in decision-making processes has been a major issue in this field.

These variables underline the various obstacles that face the implementation of a true intersectoral participation, one that successfully involves all water users. This article uses the case study of the Rhone River to explore the issues of public participation within a transboundary river where no international basin organization has been able to successfully regroup the different initiatives. I consider this example to be particularly interesting, as it allows for a comparison between different arenas that are not linked, yet are active within the same river basin.

The status of vulnerable habitats is strongly affected by land use change as well; therefore, this process requires stakeholder involvement. Opinions on what aspects are presumed to be affected most by changes in climate were gathered during semistructured interviews from farmers and conservationists in the Koros-Maros National Park in Hungary. Stakeholders revealed negative impacts resulting from extreme floods, droughts, and changes in rainfall and temperature, and they highlighted challenges relating to conflicting management objectives and perverse incentives arising from policy-level issues (such as regulatory structures and implementation). Subjects noted that years with high precipitation caused adverse conditions for livestock, late mowing due to inaccessible pastures, poor quality of hay, and undergrazing (but still compaction damage). Years with negative precipitation records show decreased quantity and quality of hay, loss of valuable forage, winter shortage of green fodder, land degradation, increased water demand, shifting grazing seasons, decreasing carrying capacity, overgrazing, heat stress, declines in physical activities, expansion of invasive alien species, and conflicts between economic interests and nature conservation objectives.

Recent studies have shown that mammalian hybrid zones occur in nature more frequently than previously thought. I summarize the history of research on mammalian hybrid zones, highlighting contributions that demonstrate genetic, behavioural and environmental mechanisms responsible for spatial distribution of genotypes, maintenance or elimination of reproductive barriers and evolutionary outcomes of hybridization. The role of hybridization in mammalian evolution, adaptation and diversification is demonstrated by the existence of hybrid swarms (e.g. caribou) and species genesis via homoploid hybridization (e.g. primates, bats). Mammalian hybrid zones are ideal settings in which to investigate genetic mechanisms that influence mate preferences as well as other questions regarding sexual selection. Many evolutionary processes and mechanisms associated with sexual selection have been well demonstrated in primate, rodent and seal hybrid zones by combining behavioural and genetic, and environmental techniques. Investigations of interbreeding chromosomal races of mouse Mus musculus and shrew Sorex araneus provide insight into the role of chromosome rearrangements in the speciation process. The genomes of some mammals that hybridize in nature are fully sequenced, and rapid progress is being made towards understanding genetic underpinnings of phenotypes governing reproductive isolation. Future studies of mammalian hybrid zones will incorporate genomic techniques with increasing frequency and taxonomic representation. Such techniques may include examination of gene expression patterns using microarrays or large-scale analysis of introgression using markers from multiple genetic systems (e.g. mitochondria, sex chromosomes). As methods improve, researchers will be better positioned to advise managers and policy makers about the potential outcomes of hybridization.

Climate change that will increase the intensity of precipitation will also increase the magnitude of the design discharge and thus would probably result in adverse effects on the existing drainage facilities. This paper aims to evaluate the potential impact of rainfall intensity variation due to climate change on the existing drainage infrastructure by investigating whether (1) the stormwater drainage infrastructure designed for preclimate conditions is able to sustain future higher discharges, and (2) new design guidelines are necessary to be established to include the potential rainfall intensity variation due to climate change. A case study was conducted using 34 years of rainfall data (1980-2013) obtained from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC). These data and the weather scenario data projected by the four run global circulation model (GCMs) under the three emissions scenarios coupled with stochastic weather generator model which generates daily weather time series statistically were used to update the current intensity-duration-frequency curve to reflect the rainfall intensity variation due to climate change. Furthermore, runoff simulation using a storm and sanitary software program was performed to analyze whether the increase in the intensity of rainfall due to climate change would have an adverse impact on the current drainage system to convey excess runoff. The results showed that most elements of the current drainage infrastructure in the boundary of the study area were inadequate to convey excess runoff. However, climate change magnifies the problems that already exist in an aging drainage infrastructure. Furthermore, considering the rehabilitation or replacement rates of these aging infrastructures are relatively slow, emphasis must not lie only on the future climate change, but also on identifying the weak spots in the system coupled with, the economic and environmental factors before any changes in design criteria can be recommended due to climate change.

This is due to the use of reductionist and qualitative approaches which is dependent upon the perspective of the assessor(s). Therefore, a more rigorous and holistic approach is required to evaluate sustainability in a more consistent way. In this paper, a matrix-based methodology in order to assess the indicated level and nature of sustainability for any project, policy, indicators, legislation, regulation, or other framework is described. The Geocybernetic Assessment Matrix (GAM) is designed to evaluate the level and nature of sustainability or unsustainability occurring in respect the fundamental and complex geocybernetic paradigms. The GAM method is described in detail in respect to the theory behind it and the methodology. The GAM is then demonstrated using an appropriate case study Part 1 of the UK Climate Change Act (2008) concerning carbon budgets and targets. The results indicate that the Part 1 of Act may not achieve the desired goals in contributing towards sustainable development through the stated mechanisms for carbon budgets and targets.

A second question is whether bio-sequestration in the Wet Tropics of Queensland is cost-competitive with southern Australia. A third, given that plantations of monocultures also provide carbon sinks, is: are the goals of carbon sequestration and biodiversity mutually exclusive or complementary? Australia intends to meet its Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions target even though it has not ratified the Protocol. While a national system of carbon emission cap and trade does not exist, unilateral action by some states to mandate industry caps has generated a demand for offsets. However, it is the voluntary market for offsets, stimulated by demand by companies and government departments that is most active. The favourable climate and soils of the Wet Tropics Region of north Queensland have enabled the evolution of unique ecosystems. Deforestation of these has been greatly reduced by World Heritage listing of the Wet Tropics. Nevertheless much of the landscape remains fragmented. An official priority is the encouragement of rainforest plantations on private land with the aim of augmenting endangered ecosystems and the habitat of iconic species, but reforestation is heavily subsidised by the Australian government. Using methodology that allows the comparison of uneven streams of costs and benefits, it is found that - at present prices - payments for sequestered carbon defray only a small proportion of costs, providing a level of incentive insufficient to stimulate restoration. Comparative analysis shows that monocultures sequester carbon at a much lower price per tonne. However, despite the relatively high growth rates of monocultures in the region, their cost per tonne of carbon are greater than costs in southern Australia. A decreasing supply of suitable land for biosequestration offsets in southern Australia may well force brokers to look to the Wet Tropics. In this event - the economic analysis suggests - land in areas that carried endangered or threatened ecosystems will be devoted to monocultures rather than restored rainforest. The paper highlights the asymmetry between the availability of credits for carbon and of credits for biodiversity and the need for public investment in conservation and restoration. Requiring further investigation is the potential demand for carbon offsets with high biodiversity benefits so called ""boutique abatements"" - that could readily be supplied in the Queensland Wet Tropics.

However, this body of work pays inadequate attention to important on-the-ground realities, including feasibility of implementation and the power dynamics embedded in multi-scalar systems of environmental governance. This paper presents findings from a research project on challenges to adaptive management in the variable wetland ecosystem of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Many residents of this rural region rely on transitional agricultural practices, shifting between dryland and floodplain farming in response to dynamic precipitation and flooding patterns. Higher than average floods in 2009-2011 inundated many floodplain fields past the point of production, causing farmers to shift to the dryland for multiplem seasons. At the same time, the highly centralized Government of Botswana began to implement stricter regulations over floodplain resources, which stemmed in part from a new adaptive management plan developed for the region. As a result, many farmers felt pressured by the government to abandon transitional livelihood practices and to shift permanently to dryland agriculture even though many preferred to continue floodplain farming. This loss of a responsive livelihood strategy will likely result in decreased long-term adaptive capacity for many residents. Drawing on these findings, this paper advances the argument that if adaptive management is to become a viable option for communities in changing environments, more attention must be given to the role of unequal power relations in multi-scalar systems of environmental governance.

An initial framework of adaptive capacity was developed through an examination of key literature, a scoping study and a questionnaire survey. This was then tested and refined through the assessment of adaptive capacity at three UK World Heritage Sites, the analysis of national and international policy and interviews with stakeholders at the national and international level. The process of analysis and development of a revised conceptual framework gave insights into some of the challenges of investigating adaptive capacity.

Consequently, blueprint control programmes have failed and suboptimal sheep productivity due to nematode parasites has become commonplace.

The aims of this research are to identify hotspots and prioritize zones presently threatened by persistent droughts and whose subsurface systems are susceptible and vulnerable to climate change. Thus, exposure index is defined by the change of future rainfall from a GCM model, sensitivity index is assessed by a modified DRASTIC technique, and the adaptive capacity in this region is associated with the current occurrence of seasonal droughts.

Moreover, the ultimate global costs to coastal resources will depend strongly on adaptation, society's response to cope with the local impacts. This paper presents a new open-source optimization model to assess global coastal impacts from SLR from the perspective of economic efficiency. The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) determines the optimal strategy for adaptation at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments, as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006), based on their socioeconomic characteristics and the potential impacts of relative sea level rise and uncertain sea level extremes. A deterministic application of CIAM demonstrates the model's ability to assess local impacts and direct costs, choose the least-cost adaptation, and estimate global net damages for several climate scenarios that account for both global and local components of SLR (Kopp et al. 2014). CIAM finds that there is large potential for coastal adaptation to reduce the expected impacts of SLR compared to the alternative of no adaptation, lowering global net present costs through 2100 by a factor of seven to less than $1.7 trillion, although this does not include initial transition costs to overcome an under-adapted current state. In addition to producing aggregate estimates, CIAM results can also be interpreted at the local level, where retreat (e.g., relocate inland) is often a more cost-effective adaptation strategy than protect (e.g., construct physical defenses).",2016.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Estimating global damages from sea level rise with the Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM),Environmental studies & forestry,Delavane B.,Delavane,1.0,1.0

The package must include a robust legal framework, policy and regulatory certainty, strong institutional structure, identification of sector-specific barriers and implementation of measures to overcome them, consultations with key stakeholders, enhanced awareness and information dissemination, and proactive approach to risk mitigation and reduced transaction costs.

Climate change is also locally perceived to have reduced the overall amount of water coming into the wetlands, causing them to dry much earlier in the dry season, and wetland crop cultivation cannot be extended much into the dry season as was in the past.

In contrast to their argument that the main causes of the floods in Bangkok were climate change and nature, I argue that the causes of the 2011 floods are compound. They are a result of human-nature interactions: while Thailand did receive heavy rainfall that year; a number of human activities interacted with this heavy rainfall to create the floods. During the past few decades, local political elite have risen to power and profited the most from Bangkok's urbanization activities while changes to the physical environment of Bangkok have made those living there more vulnerable to floods. These activities include massive land use change and concretization which have drastically increased run-off, over-pumping of groundwater, and the filling of canals. Further, both the local and national government's overreliance on antiquated and poorly maintained infrastructure made the city more vulnerable to the 2011 floods.

As a result, there is a burgeoning body of studies recommending adaptation options, pathways and strategies generated by the research and increasingly private consulting sector. However, recent reviews of global adaptation performance repeatedly highlight a lack of implementation of many adaptation studies and plans. It is suggested here that one of the reasons why many coastal adaptation plans have not been applied is due to inadequate consideration of the political risk, underpinned by lack of consideration of potential allocation and distributional impacts of adaptation strategies. The work presented here identifies the political risk of the most common coastal adaptation pathways and approaches ('retreat', 'protect' and 'manage'). This work especially highlights the major political risk of pre-emptive planned retreat adaptation strategies, which may seem the most obvious adaptation approach from the perspective of minimising future risks to settlements and infrastructure. However, it carries the largest political risk and potential distributional impacts, which is likely to hinder the adoption of this adaptation strategy in the short term. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This problem is expected to be worse with increasing horizontal resolution. In order to detect intensive disturbances in surface pressure moving rapidly through the model domain, a filtered surface pressure field (MCUF) is computed operationally in the ARPEGE global model of Meteo France. The field is distributed in the coupling files along with conventional meteorological fields used for lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) for the operational forecast using limited area model ALADIN (Aire Limitee Adaptation dynamique Developpement InterNational) in the Meteorological and Hydrological Service of Croatia (DHMZ). Here an analysis is performed of the MCUF field for the LACE coupling domain for the period from 23 January 2006, when it became available, until 15 November 2014. The MCUF field is a good indicator of rapidly moving pressure disturbances (RMPDs). Its spatial and temporal distribution can be associated with the usual cyclone tracks and areas known to be supporting cyclogenesis. An alternative set of coupling files from the IFS operational run in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is also available operationally in DHMZ with 3-hourly temporal resolution, but the MCUF field is not available. Here, several methods are tested that detect RMPDs in surface pressure a posteriori from the IFS model fields provided in the coupling files. MCUF is computed by running ALADIN on the coupling files from IFS. The error function is computed using one-time-step integration of ALADIN on the coupling files without initialization, initialized with digital filter initialization (DFI) or scale-selective DFI (SSDFI). Finally, the amplitude of changes in the mean sea level pressure is computed from the fields in the coupling files. The results are compared to the MCUF field of ARPEGE and the results of same methods applied to the coupling files from ARPEGE. Most methods give a signal for the RMPDs, but DFI reduces the storms too much to be detected. The error functions without filtering and amplitude have more noise, but the signal of a RMPD is also stronger.

CISTA addresses questions concerning ""how to adapt"" our ecosystems to climate change and has three or more layers: A base (element) layer has abiotic/biotic information (e.g. ecological, agro-hydrological, and meteorological data). One or more components (intermediate) layer(s) have ecological, agro-hydrological, and climatological indicators (e.g. length of the growing season and growing degree days) that affect the ecosystem. Indicators are identified and estimated from an element layer. In the final layer, the translation of information from indicators to adaptation strategies (incremental systems and transformational adaptation) depends on the degree of change and the level of adaptation.

Analysis of these data reveals three reasons for non-migration: high levels of satisfaction, resource barriers and low mobility potential. Immobility in dissatisfied people is more likely to be caused by attachment to place than resource constraints. Thus, the results suggest that trapped populations exist along a continuum.

In the face of climate change, agricultural systems need to adapt measures for not only increasing food supply catering to the growing population worldwide with changing dietary patterns but also to negate the negative environmental impacts on the earth. Crop simulation models are the primary tools available to assess the potential consequences of climate change on crop production and informative adaptive strategies in agriculture risk management. In consideration with the important issue, this is an attempt to provide a review on the relationship between climate change impacts and crop production. It also emphasizes the role of crop simulation models in achieving food security. Significant progress has been made in understanding the potential consequences of environment-related temperature and precipitation effect on agricultural production during the last half century. Increased CO2 fertilization has enhanced the potential impacts of climate change, but its feasibility is still in doubt and debates among researchers. To assess the potential consequences of climate change on agriculture, different crop simulation models have been developed, to provide informative strategies to avoid risks and understand the physical and biological processes. Furthermore, they can help in crop improvement programmes by identifying appropriate future crop management practises and recognizing the traits having the greatest impact on yield. Nonetheless, climate change assessment through model is subjected to a range of uncertainties. The prediction uncertainty can be reduced by using multimodel, incorporating crop modelling with plant physiology, biochemistry and gene-based modelling.

The activity is carried out in compliance with COordinated Regional climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) initiative, where domain suitability is assessed through seven simulations for the period 2001-2005. After the selection of domain, eight simulations are carried out to find better performing convection and land-surface schemes within RegCM4 for the same time period of 5 years. These experiments are conducted using ERA-Interim reanalysis datasets; however, the selection of optimal settings is also validated using other reanalysis datasets. Finally, using the same settings, data of five CMIP5 general circulation models (GCMs) are also downscaled to assess the applicability of RegCM4. Statistical measures, such as correlation coefficient, bias, root mean square difference and standard deviation, are taken into consideration to compare the simulated data against the gridded Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets. RegCM4-simulated rainfall and temperature show better spatial distributions and magnitudes against observations, as compared to ERA-Interim data, which may be considered as an added value of the model.

The first strongly views stricter laws and regulations, developed in tandem with science and data-driven approaches, as the best way to improve stormwater management. The second desires new rules and institutions to foster integrated management approaches, as well as more robust economic instruments capable of assigning a monetary value to stormwater, as critical to resolving stormwater problems.

Second, a dynamic heat load plan performs better if heat waves only increase in frequency. Third, if both intensity and frequency of heat waves increase substantially, a specific contract between the environmental regulator and electricity producers (the minimum power plant concept) performs comparatively best.

Tiger range countries and their partners met at the 1st Asian Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation in January 2010 to mandate the creation of the Global Tiger Recovery Program to double the number of tigers by 2022. Only 3200-3600 wild adult tigers remain, approximately half of the population estimated a decade ago. Tigers now live in only 13 countries, all of which are experiencing severe environmental challenges and degradation from the effects of human population growth, brisk economic expansion, rapid urbanization, massive infrastructure development and climate change. The overarching challenge of tiger conservation, and the conservation of biodiversity generally, is that there is insufficient demand for the survival of wild tigers living in natural landscapes. This allows the criminal activities of poaching wild tigers and their prey and trafficking in tiger derivatives to flourish and tiger landscapes to be diminished. The Global Tiger Recovery Program will support scaling up of practices already proven effective in one or more tiger range countries that need wider policy support, usually resources, and new transnational actions that enhance the effectiveness of individual country actions. The program is built on robust National Tiger Recovery Priorities that are grouped into themes: (i) strengthening policies that protect tigers; (ii) protecting tiger conservation landscapes; (iii) scientific management and monitoring; (iv) engaging communities; (v) cooperative management of international tiger landscapes; (vi) eliminating transnational illegal wildlife trade; (vii) persuading people to stop consuming tiger; (viii) enhancing professional capacity of policy-makers and practitioners; and (ix) developing sustainable, long-term financing mechanisms for tiger and biodiversity conservation.",2010.0,WILEY,Zoology,Saving wild tigers: A case study in biodiversity loss and challenges to be met for recovery beyond 2010,Biology,John,John,0.0,0.0

Within this framework and in the context of global processes, research on the interactions among cities, environmental migration and GEC present two interrelated perspectives. On the one hand, cities are increasingly exposed to the impacts of GEC events, which can trigger environmental migration to other regions. On the other hand, they are the most common destinations of migration inflows, and environmental change outside of cities can exacerbate the influx of migrants to cities.

We apply a bio-economic model to investigate the influence of risk aversion on nitrogen use in Swiss maize production. Income risks for farmers are expected to increase in the future, for instance, due to higher price variability caused by market liberalization or by higher yield variability caused by climate change. We investigate the influence of changes in these sources of risks on optimal levels of nitrogen use and its influence on the effects of nitrogen taxation. Our empirical analysis for Swiss maize production shows that risk-aversion leads to lower levels of nitrogen application than for risk-neutral farmers. Furthermore, nitrogen taxes lead to higher reductions of nitrogen use if farmers are risk-averse and these farmers face lower abatement costs. Thus, analyses on the effect of nitrogen taxes that are solely based on profit maximizing behavior may underestimate nitrogen reductions and overestimate abatement costs. Taking expected shocks in price and yield variability into account, we find that these differences between risk neutral and risk-averse decision makers will increase further. External influences on production and price risks can thus influence the effects of agricultural policies on farmers' decision making. Thus, considering farmers' risk-preferences as well as potential increases in farmers' income risks can improve agricultural policy making. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been concluded that the policy of unplanned water release during the dry year 2007, when little attention was paid to the possibility of a continuation of the drought, contributed to the remarkable lack of surface water storage during 2008, another dry year. For better management and planning, this paper presents theoretical models to evaluate the occurrence probability and return period for extreme droughts, assuming that drought deficits are Beta distributed. Droughts of a short length (2-3 years) and deficits that exceed a threshold deficit (D-o) are the most frequent droughts in the central Jordan region. Regardless of the drought deficit magnitude and the drought length, the return period of any drought condition is nearly 4 years. This paper recommends the application of large-scale sustainable solutions to reduce the gap between the demand on water and supply in Jordan during drought conditions.

This issue is addressed here by developing and testing the soil (heat-moisture-vapor) HMV-model, a 1-D (one-dimensional) non-equilibrium (liquid-vapor phase change) model of soil evaporation that simulates the coupled simultaneous transport of heat, soil moisture, and water vapor. This model is intended for use with surface forcing ranging from daily solar cycles to extreme conditions encountered during fires. It employs a linearized Crank-Nicolson scheme for the conservation equations of energy and mass and its performance is evaluated against dynamic soil temperature and moisture observations, which were obtained during laboratory experiments on soil samples exposed to surface heat fluxes ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 W m(-2). The Hertz-Knudsen equation is the basis for constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Some unusual aspects of the model that were found to be extremely important to the model's performance include (1) a dynamic (temperature and moisture potential dependent) condensation coefficient associated with the evaporative source term, (2) an infrared radiation component to the soil's thermal conductivity, and (3) a dynamic residual soil moisture. This last term, which is parameterized as a function of temperature and soil water potential, is incorporated into the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions in order to improve the model's ability to capture the evaporative dynamics of the strongly bound soil moisture, which requires temperatures well beyond 150 degrees C to fully evaporate. The model also includes film flow, although this phenomenon did not contribute much to the model's overall performance. In general, the model simulates the laboratory-observed temperature dynamics quite well, but is less precise (but still good) at capturing the moisture dynamics. The model emulates the observed increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front and the hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of drying. It also captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture that occurs at relatively low temperatures (50-90 degrees C), and can provide quite accurate predictions of the total amount of soil moisture evaporated during the laboratory experiments. The model's solution for water vapor density (and vapor pressure), which can exceed 1 standard atmosphere, cannot be experimentally verified, but they are supported by results from (earlier and very different) models developed for somewhat different purposes and for different porous media. Overall, this non-equilibrium model provides a much more physically realistic simulation over a previous equilibrium model developed for the same purpose.

Case studies were conducted in two agro-pastoral counties of northern China, a region that confronts frequent drought and that has experienced extensive institutional changes over recent decades. Based on the exploration of four adaptation strategies, the field results show that both counties have experienced an acceleration of livelihood diversification, an increase in storage and market exchanges, and a dramatic reduction in previously common pooling. The findings reveal that these adaptations are not a direct result of coping with climate risks but rather are indicative of livelihood strategies that result from the combined impacts of institutional, socioeconomic and climatic changes. Current institutional arrangements have negative impacts on local climate adaptations. This is particularly true for those with limited livelihood options, and such arrangements may therefore foster an increase in inequality with regard to household adaptive capacities over the long term. Therefore, this study recommends flexible policies that facilitate local arrangements rather than the current one-for-all policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Explicit consideration of physiology and ecology can target efficient habitat management actions such as identifying where to add shading or to extend hydroperiod. This approach can also improve outcomes when re-establishing native fauna by identifying life stages robust to release. Further we can improve our management of invasive species by explicit consideration of physiological constraints on dispersal capability of the invasive species to help plan where to fragment habitat connectivity to block invasions.

This article will address this gap through a case study on the emergence of flood insurance in Canada, and the approach to its expansion. Between 2013 and 2016, insurance industry officials representing over 60% of premiums collected in Canada were interviewed. These interviews revealed that flood insurance is being expanded in response to institutional pressure, specifically external stakeholder expectations that the insurance industry will adopt a stronger role in managing flood risk through coverage of flood damage. Further evidence of this finding is explored by assessing the emergence of a unique flood insurance model that involves a risk-adjusted and optional product along with an expansion of government policy supporting flood risk mitigation. This approach attempts to balance industry concerns about economic viability with institutional pressure to reduce flood risk through insurance.

Based on the analysis, I conclude that spatial-planning measures require new forms of ""localized"" policy knowledge to support the more decentralized responsibility structures that underpin spatial-planning measures.

The analysis has been carried out for two future time periods: mid-century (2040-2069) and end-century (2070-2099). Results indicate positive departures throughout Saudi Arabia with the greatest warming generally focussed on the central region. A clear transition to a hotter climate from the mid-century to end-century was evident from the results. Analysis of projected temperature departures at four locations, namely Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam, and Jazan, revealed that Riyadh is likely to experience the highest warming with projected departures under A2 scenario exceeding 3.5 and 5.5 A degrees C for the mid-century and end-century, respectively. Results of ensemble analysis indicate that, under A2 scenario, 80 % of the models project an increase of 3 A degrees C for the mid-century and 5 A degrees C for the end-century period.

Water resources that are already over allocated face competing demands from growing urban populations, unresolved tribal water claims, and for maintenance of riparian habitats. While many believe we can meet these demands by reallocating water from agriculture, climate change complicates this calculus. Warmer temperatures and longer droughts will reduce regional water supplies and increase agricultural water demands, making transfers more costly. Hydrological-economic modeling studies suggest agricultural water use will decline, leaving urban use relatively unchanged. Although this agriculture-to-urban reallocation of water is often treated primarily as an engineering problem, many legal and institutional barriers exist to large-scale water transfers.

This conceptual framework is used to present a qualitative, in-depth study about the transformation of the volatile issue of urban warming in the face of climate change in the Netherlands, and the related knowledge claims on the future of this issue. As this case makes clear, the constant erosion of legitimacy for urban warming as a matter of collective concern is important to understand the transformation of knowledge claims.

As an example case study, the December 2014 flood in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, was investigated. Atmospheric conditions at the onset of the flood event are described and evaluated with respect to the general weather circulation, initial wetness, and event precipitation. Persistent, predominantly westerly general weather circulations (GWCs) directed several low-pressure systems over the North Sea to Schleswig-Holstein during December 2014, accompanied by prolonged rainfall and finally a strong precipitation event in southern Schleswig-Holstein, causing several inland gauges to exceed their, by then maximum, water levels. Results show that the antecedent precipitation index (API) is able to reflect the soil moisture conditions and, in combination with the maximum 3-day precipitation sum (R3d), to capture the two main drivers finally leading to the flood: (1) the initial wetness of north-western Schleswig-Holstein and (2) strong event precipitation in southern and eastern Schleswig-Holstein from 21 to 23 December; at the same time, both indices exceeded their respective 5-year return periods. Further, trend analyses show that both API and R3d have been increasing during recent years, while regional patterns match the north-eastward shift of cyclone pathways, leading to a higher risk of flooding in Schleswig-Holstein. Within the network of experts, investigations of these and further indices/drivers for earth system changes (e.g. wind surge and sea level rise) derived from observations, reanalyses, and regional climate model data are planned for all German coastal areas.

Adaptation to climate change is used to illustrate the ubiquitous uncertainty surrounding problem solving and how the choice of assessment framework can overemphasize some sources of uncertainty and ignore others. A challenge is to communicate the information about complexity and uncertainty that decision makers need for robust and flexible decision making but at the same time prevent uncertainty from being equated with a lack of consensus and used as a reason for inaction. Geographers need to be open to a plurality of approaches to decision making and acknowledge uncertainty in their own research.

Consequently, suboptimal sheep productivity due to nematode parasites has become commonplace because blueprint control programmes have failed.

We identify relationships between 12 indicators of five types of capital and vulnerability with t-tests and six logistic models considering the capital indicator itself, its first-order lag and its square as dependent variables to test the hypothesis that a high level of each capital metric results in low vulnerability. Through differing adaptive capacities between resilient and sensitive groups, we found that only four of the 12 (e.g., the access to finance, cash income level, total crop gross revenues, and family share of farm income) relate to vulnerability, which challenges the hypothesis that increasing capital reduces vulnerability.

But while the physical variables under study are easily identified, the notion of resilience itself remains nebulous. In recent years, it has been taken to mean both mitigation and adaptation, concepts that are often used in interchangeably or in conjunction (sometimes hyphenated as ""adaptation-mitigation""). But mitigation and adaptation could in fact be antithetical to one another: the first refers to the ability to carry on ""business as usual"" activities (RI) while the second rejects the business as usual paradigm and recognizes new realities (R2). This tension poses a special challenge to water security in cities. The case of a severe drought in Singapore, the longest in 130 years, illustrates how these conceptual difficulties create policy problems. Water security has largely been defined as RI. But in the face of large-scale climatic change events, R2, especially along the human dimensions, becomes increasingly relevant.

This is further illustrated through the example of the built environment sector, where it can be seen that the probabilistic approach may be of limited salience for the urban heat island in the absence of a corresponding effort towards a more place-based analysis of climate vulnerabilities.

Inappropriate use of waterlogged soils can cause serious damage to soil and water resources. Limitations are particularly pronounced in locations with wetter climates and on soils which have inherent drainage problems. Constraints may also vary temporally due to climate variability and climate change. These issues are investigated through the strategic use of a risk assessment framework that combines climatic and soil factors to map changes in soil wetness risk at country level. Wetness risk is evaluated in terms of soil wetness classes and the constraints it imposes on arable and improved grassland using an empirical land capability scheme. A case study in Scotland analyses spatio-temporal variations of wetness risk and associated land-use constraints for 1961-1980 and 1991-2010 periods and using a future 2050s projection based upon the HadRM3/HadCM3 climate model ensemble. Results suggest increased risk levels in recent decades for south-west and central Scotland which are both important areas for livestock agriculture. However, wetness risk in these high risk areas is tentatively projected to reduce under average 2050s conditions based upon a central estimate from the model ensemble. Wetness risk has been adjusted based upon the assumed presence and performance of subsurface field,drainage systems but this remains a significant uncertainty due to limited data availability. As artificial drainage represents the major alternative adaptation strategy compared to change of land use, the case study highlights a need to further evaluate its efficacy and long-term viability for those areas identified at high risk.

This technique allows for the rapid development of climate scenarios for additional emissions scenarios not previously available from the GCM modelling centres. Having derived the end of century (2080s) change in both these variables for four marker emissions scenarios (A1FI, A2, B2, B1), regional response rates, or the regional rate of warming per AC global warming at each station, were calculated. The estimated ranges in regional responses at each station were then compared to regional response rates for the Irish 'grid box' derived from a larger sample of 14 GCMs, in order to determine if the calculated response rates were illustrative of a wider suite of GCMs. A Monte Carlo (MC) resampling approach was then employed to sample regional response rates for selected stations and for different estimates of future warming. On the basis of the MC approach, probability distribution functions (pdfs) of simulated changes in temperature and precipitation were constructed and compared to the original statistically downscaled data. The methodology and results presented represent a significant contribution to the traditional approach of statistical downscaling through the development of associated likelihoods, rather than just a change in the mean value. While the methodology presented should enable the rapid development of probabilistic based climate projections, based on a limited availability of downscaled climate scenarios, caution needs to be exercised in the interpretation of the results. While they provide a basis for risk or policy assessment, estimates of the level of risk are not independent of the method employed.",2013.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,Physical Geography,Deriving probabilistic based climate scenarios using pattern scaling and statistically downscaled data: A case study application from Ireland,Geography,Rowan,Rowan,0.0,0.0

Relative-gains concerns incited by the international resource transfers implicit in climate change policy may compel some states to be prudent in their international climate change efforts and conserve resources domestically for future contingencies, including their own adaptation and resiliency. Neoclassical realism recognises such systemic constraints while also identifying international and domestic factors - a 'two-level game' - that explain variation in state sensitivity to relative gains. As a preliminary test of this theory, I compare the latest data on the magnitude, distribution and financial 'additionality' of climate funds and carbon markets. Climate funds are found to be more vulnerable to systemic forces identified by neoclassical realism because they are largely drawn from existing official development assistance budgets despite international commitments that funds are 'new and additional'. Carbon markets engage a relatively broader number of states and, contrary to moral hazard concerns, have been used to a greater degree by states reducing emissions domestically. While there are concerns about whether carbon credits represent genuine emission reductions, the effectiveness of climate funds is equally, if not more, dubious. I conclude that, while imperfect, carbon markets have too often been unfairly compared with an ideal climate finance mechanism that assumes few political constraints on international resource transfers for climate change.",2014.0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,International Relations,Neoclassical realism and international climate change politics: moral imperative and political constraint in international climate finance,Political science,Mark,Mark,0.0,0.0

Apulia, with a coastline extending for over 800 km, is the Italian region with the largest coastal karst aquifers. Apulian aquifers have suffered both in terms of water quality and quantity. Some regional regulations were implemented from the 1970s with the purpose of controlling the number of wells, well locations, and well discharge. The practical effects of these management criteria, the temporal and spatial trend of recharge, groundwater quality, and seawater intrusion effects are discussed based on long-term monitoring. The efficacy of existing management tools and the development of predictive scenarios to identify the best way to reconcile irrigation and demands for high -quality drinking water have been pursued in a selected area. The Salento peninsula was selected as the Apulian aquifer portion exposed to the highest risk of quality degradation due to seawater intrusion. The capability of large-scale numerical models in groundwater management was tested, particularly for achieving forecast scenarios to evaluate the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources.

Climate change induced by anthropogenic warming of the earth's atmosphere is a daunting problem and there are several observations about the role of urbanization, with its high levels of vehicle emissions and other pollutants, and westernized lifestyle with respect to the rising frequency of respiratory allergic diseases observed in most industrialized countries. There is also evidence that asthmatic subjects are at increased risk of developing exacerbations of bronchial obstruction with exposure to gaseous (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide) and particulate inhalable components of air pollution. A change in the genetic predisposition is an unlikely cause of the increasing frequency in allergic diseases because genetic changes in a population require several generations. Consequently, environmental factors such as climate change and indoor and outdoor air pollution may contribute to explain the increasing frequency of respiratory allergy and asthma. Since concentrations of airborne allergens and air pollutants are frequently increased contemporaneously, an enhanced IgE-mediated response to aeroallergens and enhanced airway inflammation could account for the increasing frequency of allergic respiratory diseases and bronchial asthma.

This law describes phenology as varying along climatic gradients by latitude, longitude, and altitude. Yet phenological patterns are not only affected by contemporary climatic differences across space, but also by underlying geographic variations in plant genetics that arise from long-term climatic adaptation. The latter influence on geographic patterns in phenology has been undervalued to this day, mainly due to the difficulty of quantifying it. This study outlines a methodology for bridging this knowledge gap through delineating geographic adaption patterns using common garden and cloned plant phenology. Through synthesizing existing literature, typical geographic adaptation patterns in both spring and autumn phenology of many temperate tree species are identified. Under uniform environment, spring leaf-out of colder climate-adapted populations of a certain species is either earlier than warmer climate-adapted ones due to lower thermal requirements, or later because of higher chilling (for dormancy release) demands. The former leads to a countergradient pattern as it is opposite to an in situ observation, while the latter leads to a cogradient pattern. Autumn leaf senescence, on the other hand, expresses a consistent cogradient pattern that is related to latitude and constrained by the populations' varied photoperiod requirements. These geographic adaptation patterns allow a clearer understanding of geographical variations in phenological responses to climate change, and provide a theoretical basis for spatially explicit phenological models. In addition, given that these adaptive patterns reveal genotype-based variabilities, they are potentially useful for more accurately tracking phenology-dependent ecosystem processes (e.g. species distribution) and non-weather-related vegetation changes. As a unique subfield of physical geography with broad environmental implications, this line of research needs to be further developed by furnishing a stronger and more explicit spatial structure into current phenological studies.",2016.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,Physical Geography,Beyond the Bioclimatic Law: Geographic adaptation patterns of temperate plant phenology,Geography,Liang,Liang,0.125,0.0

Findings - The project led to individual and collaborative research linked to policy advice for Norwegian municipalities. Barriers and opportunities to act locally regarding extreme weather were identified, giving ways forward through more science along with policy and action possibilities. Research limitations/implications - Only three main sectors were covered: drinking water supply, cultural heritage, and flood risk reduction. Extreme weather affects other sectors too, but no advice is given regarding those areas. Practical implications - The project led to fact sheets, a web site, and engagement with practitioners at the municipal level in two ways. First, providing science-based advice that can be used by those working for municipalities. Second, providing practical advice to scientists regarding what practitioners seek from research. Social implications - The work will contribute to improving how Norwegian municipalities consider and address extreme weather, in the context of climate change amongst other hazards, along with further social and environmental changes affecting municipalities.

This study examines the frequency and severity of tidal flooding due to increases in sea level of between 0.3 to 1.8 m (1.0 and 6.0 ft), as well as where flooding will generally occur. Local tide gauge data are compared to the National Weather Service's flood stage categories to determine how frequently they will be reached at high tide as sea level rises. GIS data are used to demonstrate where flooding is likely to occur, and U.S. Census data are used to identify assets that will be impacted. The study also depicts the relationships among the multiple datums currently used to measure water levels in Boston. Results of the analysis indicate that in the absence of any new flood barriers, the incidence of minor tidal flooding will increase to about 75 times per year within Boston Harbor with 0.3 m (1 ft) of sea-level rise. Nine-tenths of a meter (3 ft) of sea-level rise will result in about 30 occurrences of moderate flooding per year, and 1.2 m (4 ft) will bring that same frequency of major flooding incidents. Tidal flooding due to 1.8 m (6 ft) of sea-level rise will affect approximately 20% of the population and land, as well as housing, public facilities, transportation infrastructure, and hazardous waste sites.

We adapted the approach based on ""participatory vulnerability assessments"" developed for climate change research and applied it to changes occurring in a conservation and development context.

Compensation measures such as ongoing community development plans are not yet impacting local livelihoods. Their success will only be measurable in the long term, whereas the restriction in access to the national park is already in effect.

This proposal is evaluated using an energy-economic model of the global economy. The model is supplemented by marginal abatement cost curves and bottom-up information on abatement potentials in order to represent how clean development financing affects emissions reductions. The results indicate that carbon tariffs could raise US$3.5-24.5 billion (with a central value of $9.8 billion) for clean development financing. This could reduce the emissions of non-Annex I countries by 5-15% and still leave funds available for other purposes, such as adaptation.

This article considers the challenges Africa faces in implementing the Sendai Framework and recommends that besides ""Africanizing"" Sendai goals and strengthening the region's political commitment to disaster risk reduction (DRR), Africa should also develop a single framework that integrates DRR, sustainable development, climate change adaptation, and conflict prevention. Equally important is the need for a strong recognition that disasters are created endogenously as well as exogenously, and thus require local solutions and local investment.",2016.0,SPRINGEROPEN,Geology,After Sendai: Is Africa Bouncing Back or Bouncing Forward from Disasters?,Earth sciences,Bernard,Bernard,0.0,0.0

The property insurance and catastrophe reinsurance sectors are notorious for their cyclicity, with prices and returns oscillating dramatically between soft and hard markets. The problem of overaccummulation in soft market periods is often resolved by the destruction of reinsurers' capital reserves through huge catastrophic losses. This is typically followed by the revision of catastrophe models and reestimation of exposed values, processes which absorb additional (re)insurance capital and provide technoscientific legitimacy for raising rates. Reframing climate change risk in terms of ecologically-sourced devaluation suggests that, rather than posing an immediate existential threat, in the short to medium term the uncertain impacts of global climate change might constitute a recurrent catastrophic fix for particular segments of financial capital. This highlights both the productivity of uncertainty about climate change impacts and the limits of presuming that the operations of the private insurance market can produce a built environment more adapted to climate change. Rather, the more likely outcome is splintering protectionism: a patchwork of high risk, high reward areas where insurance is available only to those with the ability to pay rising premiums, leaving the state to manage the retreat and relocation of less remunerative properties and populations.",2015.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Catastrophic fixes: cyclical devaluation and accumulation through climate change impacts,Environmental studies & forestry,Leigh,Leigh,0.625,

The effect is opposite to what should be expected from much of the international relations literature; rather, it supports the observations made by recent anthropological studies. Years with below average rainfall tend to have a peaceful effect on the following year and less robustly so for the current year as well. Little support is found for the notion that scarcity of farmland fuels violence in itself or in election years. More densely populated areas - not areas with a low land per capita ratio - run a higher risk of conflict. Election years systematically see more violence, however. The findings therefore support the notion that large-scale intergroup violence is driven by calculation and political gain rather than desperate scrambles for scarce land, pasture, and water resources.",2012.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,International Relations,"Climate clashes?

Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on subsistence crop production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members' indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping.

This research aimed to develop a benchmark of funerals, by quantifying the environmental impacts of the most common funeral techniques, i.e. burial and cremation, by identifying where the main impacts originate from and by comparing these impacts to impacts of other activities during a person's life. Methods The environmental impacts of funerals were analysed by means of a life cycle assessment (LCA), based on Dutch company information, literature and expert judgements. The results were analysed per impact category but also on an aggregated level by means of shadow prices. Two sensitivity analyses were performed: one examined the high impact of cotton in funeral coffins; the other checked the results by means of another weighting method. Results and discussion The results showed no significant difference between the two funeral techniques in five impact categories. Burial has the lowest impact in more than half of the categories, but its impact is many times higher in the two most differing categories than for cremation. The total shadow price of burial is about 30 % higher than the shadow price of cremation, but the main cause for this difference is a highly debated category, namely land use. If the results would be considered without the shadow prices of land impact categories, burial would score 25 % lower than cremation. These results are representing average practise and may deviate on certain aspects for other countries, but as a starting point for further studies, this benchmark is well applicable. Conclusions and recommendations This study delivered an environmental benchmark of funerals and insights in the impacts of the individual processes, which can be used in further assessment of 'green' funeral options. The benchmark results show that the environmental impact of funerals is largely determined by secondary processes and that the total impact can be quite small in comparison to other human activities. Besides these environmental insights, it is important to take into account social, cultural, climatic, local, economical and ethical arguments before changing policies or giving recommendations.",2017.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Engineering,The environmental impact of activities after life: life cycle assessment of funerals,Engineering & technology,Elisabeth,Elisabeth,1.0,1.0

However, several major rivers and their tributaries arise in the Himalayan ranges and are fed by thousands of glaciers. Huge sediment loads carried by these rivers result in important deltas at their mouths. The climatic and physiographic diversity have endowed the region with many kinds of wetlands. Of these, the peatswamps of southeast Asia constitute about 56% of the world's tropical peatlands, and more than 42% of the world's mangroves occur in South and southeast Asia. Among other wetlands, riverine swamps are rather restricted whereas the seasonal marshes are a dominant feature. Another characteristic feature of tropical Asia are the innumerable human-made and intensively managed wetlands of which the paddy fields and aquaculture ponds are the most extensive. Throughout tropical Asia, wetlands have been a part of the socio-cultural ethos of the people and many communities have lived in wetlands. However, the pressures of high population and the economic development have extensively impacted upon wetlands which have been transformed for paddy cultivation and aquaculture, drained and converted to other land uses for economic gains (e.g., conversion to oil palm), and degraded by discharge of domestic and industrial wastes. Invasive plant and animal species have also played a significant role. The climate change is already being felt in the rapid retreat of Himalayan glaciers, increased temperature and variability in precipitation as well as the frequency of extreme events. Sea level rise is seen as a major threat to the coastal wetlands, particularly the mangroves. Increasing droughts have caused frequent fires in Indonesian peat swamps that have further feedback impacts on regional climate. However, the actual threat to wetlands in this region arises from the extensive hydrological alterations being caused by storage, abstraction and diversion of river flows for agriculture, industry and hydropower. Currently, the state of our understanding wetlands in general, and the efforts and infrastructure for research and training in wetlands are very poor. Although a few wetlands have been designated as Ramsar sites, the policies aimed at wetland conservation are either non-existent or very weak.

A detailed review of flood events from Australia, China, the Netherlands, and the USA was used to develop a case study for each country.

While many countries are attempting to restore floodplain storage, thereby reducing their reliance on levees, others are increasing their investment in levee construction. This review explores factors that affect the transferability of adaptive approaches, including issues, such as problem recognition, affordability, and program delivery. It was found that countries vary in their ability to recognise levee problems, and the level at which decisions are made influences the likelihood of adaptive solutions being adopted. Analysis suggests that federal systems face particular challenges and their capacity to adopt adaptive approaches may be impaired if institutional barriers are not addressed.

These claims belie the complexity of the multi-causal relationship between coupled social-ecological systems and human mobility, yet they have fueled the debate about ""environmentally induced migration"". Empirical evidence, notably from a 23 case study scoping study supported by the European Commission, confirms that currently environmental factors are one of many variables driving migration. Fieldwork reveals a multifaceted landscape of patterns and contexts for migration linked to rapid- and slow-onset environmental change today. Migration and displacement are part of a spectrum of possible responses to environmental change. Some forms of environmentally induced migration may be adaptive, while other forms of forced migration and displacement may indicate a failure of the social-ecological system to adapt. This diversity of migration potentials linked to environmental change presents challenges to institutions and policies not designed to cope with the impacts of complex causality, surprises and uncertainty about social-ecological thresholds, and the possibility of environmental and migration patterns recombining into a new patterns. The paper highlights fieldwork on rapid- and slow-onset environmentally induced migration in Mozambique, Vietnam, and Egypt. Current governance frameworks for human mobility are partially equipped to manage new forms of human mobility, but that new complementary modes of governance will be necessary.

Along different movement patterns, different cognitive abilities have evolved which are reviewed and discussed in relation to an organism's ability to respond to largely unpredictable environmental change due to climate and human-induced change, and linked to population trends. In brief, migrants have a combination of reliance on memory, low propensity to explore and high avoidance of environmental change that in combination with overall small brain sizes results in low flexibility to respond to unpredictable environmental change. In line with this, many migrants have negative population trends. In contrast, while nomads may use their memory to find suitable habitats, they can counteract negative effects of finding such habitats disturbed by large-scale exploratory movements and paying attention to environmental cues. They are also little avoidant of environmental change. Population trends are largely stable or increasing indicating their ability to cope with climate and human-induced change. Cognitive abilities in partial migrants are little investigated, but indicate attention to environmental cues coupled with high exploratory tendencies that allow them a flexible response to unpredictable environmental change.

Given these potential problems, some experts argue against using local plant ecotypes for ecosystem restoration. Instead, they propose to use foreign ecotypes that are adapted to the predicted climate in an approach called assisted migration within species range or predictive provenancing. I argue that such actions may cause a mismatch in biotic interactions and have negative effects on other organisms. As such, assisted migration should only be considered in cases when the local ecotypes would fail to ensure ecosystem services. In fact, there is little experimental evidence on the assisted migration approach so far, and what little there is does not seem to support its use. Even in altered climates, local ecotypes mostly performed equally well or better than foreign ones selected for their adaptations to these climates. The reason is that even if adaptation to climate plays a role, this factor may be overridden by other drivers of local adaptation, such as soil or biotic interactions. Despite assisted migration being a popular concept that is repeatedly commended in scientific literature and propagated among practitioners, it should not be considered a universal tool to improve restoration outcomes during climate change.

Findings-Although the mainstreaming entry point for NAPA is identified in the country's Vision 2020 and National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2012/13-2016/17, financial, technical, human and other resources are inadequate to ensure its effective implementation. There is little evidence of NAPA mainstreaming into development plans by the line ministries of finance and economic development other than donor-funded projects. Absence of climate change policy influence means NAPA is not well-factored into the national development agenda, as mainstreaming is difficult without appropriate policies. Most projects with effect on climate change impact abatement originate from specific sectors and are disconnected from each other. Originality/value-Based on the findings, ways to leverage NAPA via mainstreaming are discussed. It is concluded that NAPA mainstreaming offers a promising avenue for initiating and promoting sustainable livelihoods in Lesotho. The study demonstrates the applicability of the presented sustainable livelihood framework.",2017.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Mainstreaming national adaptation programmes of action into national development plans in Lesotho Lessons and needs,Environmental studies & forestry,Patrick,Patrick,0.0,0.0

Over the course of the mid-twentieth century, the Franco regime radically transformed the country's physical and demographic landscapes while limiting opportunities for dissent. Nonetheless, beginning shortly after the Civil War, a small number of highly placed nature enthusiasts and scientists worked within official channels to protect discrete spaces and species. In the process, they legitimized environmental language and ideas that were later adopted by more politicized activists. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, while working-class groups protested the disproportionate impacts of development on their own neighborhoods, left-wing cultural elites embraced similar complaints to overtly link environmental health with the regime's injustices.

This process is called evolutionary rescue and has been studied under different names in medicine, agriculture, and conservation biology. It is a component of the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics, which investigates how the ecological attributes of species may evolve rapidly under strong selection. Its distinguishing feature is to combine the evolutionary concept of relative fitness with the ecological concept of absolute fitness in a synthetic theory of persistent adaptation. The likelihood of rescue will depend both on attributes of the population, particularly abundance and variation, and on properties of the environment, particularly the rate and severity of deterioration. Medical interventions (e.g., the administration of antibiotics), agricultural practices (e.g., the application of pesticides), and population ecology (e.g., the effects of species introductions) provide numerous examples of evolutionary rescue. The general theory of rescue has been tested in laboratory experiments with microbes, in which experimental evolution shows how different treatments affect the frequency of rescue. Overall, these experiments have supported the predictions of general theory: In particular, abundance, variation, and dispersal have pronounced and repeatable effects on the rescue of populations and communities. Extending these laboratory results to the field is a major task for future research.",2017.0,ANNUAL REVIEWS,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Evolutionary Rescue,Environmental studies & forestry,Graham,Graham,0.0,0.0

The findings showed that majority of the respondents (59.1 %) still believed that climate change is a natural phenomenon that is beyond man's power to abate while industrial release, improper sewage disposal, fossil fuel use, deforestation and bush burning were perceived as the most human factors that influence climate change by the category that chose human activities (40.9 %) as the main causes of climate change. The main employed adaptation strategies by the farmers were mixed cropping, planting early matured crop, planting of resistant crops and use of agrochemicals. The arable crop farmers were relatively technically efficient with about 53 % of them having technical efficiency above the average of 0.784 for the study area.

Studies investigating future adaptation scenarios are generally found to be unbalanced in favor of the assessment of future impacts on water resources and less towards the provision of adaptation scenarios. When these studies do not provide elements to manage the specific uncertainty related to the proposed adaptation solutions, at least exploring the uncertainty related to the climatic and impact scenarios is strongly recommended.

On the other hand, indigenous communities have been continuously adapting to environmental stresses for millennia, including more recent cascading impacts of climate change. Indigenous communities have developed a wealth of information in the form of their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), based on their observations of the obvious linkages between changing climatic conditions and biodiversity. Here, I hypothesize that in harsh environments such as the alpine Himalaya, social systems particularly local institutions that are largely based on TEK are important in improving adaptive capacity by providing social, economic, and ecological security to the community. I provide an insight into the adaptation strategies of two communities that inhabit the alpine zones of the Sikkim Himalaya, in India. We address two broad questions: (1) How are indigenous communities in the vulnerable alpine zones of the Himalaya adapting to the complex challenges posed by climate change particularly in conjunction with their indigenous governing institution? We give examples of adaptation strategies and broadly categorize them into six groups, namely (a) Institutional capital, (b) Rationing, (c) Forecasting, (d) Mobility, (e) Economic diversification, and (f) Communal pooling.

The document analysis method is used to assess agricultural policy in Tyumen Province and its implications for producers' adaptation to climate change. The results suggest that although agricultural producers and policymakers are acutely aware both of climate variability and the resulting loss of agricultural output, provincial agricultural policy generally fails to encourage better adaptation by agricultural producers or to support their greater economic security. Instead, it primarily focuses on meeting food production targets and thus limits the producers' own independent moves towards adaptation.

In this article I suggest that support for violence in times of drought depends on people's relationship with their government and the way in which this relationship determines their vulnerability to adverse climatic shocks. Droughts impose serious economic pressures on affected people, especially in Sub-Saharan countries, where access to alternative sources of water is often limited. People who enjoy good relations with the sitting regime and who benefit from a wide range of public services are more likely to overcome these pressures. On the other hand, politically neglected, marginalised and disaffected people have many more difficulties in coping with drought and are likely to blame their government for it. This, in turn, can pave the way for endorsing more radical attitudes and even violence against the government and its (presumed) political supporters. The results of my analysis partly confirm this idea. Exposure to drought per se does not seem to influence attitudes towards political violence in a statistically significant way. However, I find both people who are politically discriminated against and people who do not trust their head of state to be more inclined to endorse political violence when hit by severe drought. These findings, which are consistent across a number of alternative model specifications, show that fragile state-citizen relations play an important part in the processes linking drought exposure and support for political violence.

Relative-gains concerns incited by the international resource transfers implicit in climate change policy may compel some states to be prudent in their international climate change efforts and conserve resources domestically for future contingencies, including their own adaptation and resiliency. Neoclassical realism recognises such systemic constraints while also identifying international and domestic factors -a 'two-level game' - that explain variation in state sensitivity to relative gains. As a preliminary test of this theory, I compare the latest data on the magnitude, distribution and financial 'additionality' of climate funds and carbon markets. Climate funds are found to be more vulnerable to systemic forces identified by neoclassical realism because they are largely drawn from existing official development assistance budgets despite international commitments that funds are 'new and additional'. Carbon markets engage a relatively broader number of states and, contrary to moral hazard concerns, have been used to a greater degree by states reducing emissions domestically. While there are concerns about whether carbon credits represent genuine emission reductions, the effectiveness of climate funds is equally, if not more, dubious. I conclude that, while imperfect, carbon markets have too often been unfairly compared with an ideal climate finance mechanism that assumes few political constraints on international resource transfers for climate change.",2017.0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,International Relations,Neoclassical realism and international climate change politics: moral imperative and political constraint in international climate finance,Political science,Mark,Mark,0.0,0.0

HS results in decreased growth, reproduction, production, milk quantity and quality, as well as natural immunity, making animals more vulnerable to diseases, and even death. Thus, HS results in great economic losses, emphasizing the necessity to objectively assess animal welfare. The increasing demand for animal products paralleled by the frequent hot climate is a serious threat for the agriculture sector.

Economic optimization is considered an efficient tool to decide on the design level for adaptation. The costs associated with a flooding to the T-year level and the annual capital and operational costs of adapting to this level are described with log-linear relations. The total flooding costs are developed as the expected annual damage of flooding above the T-year level plus the annual capital and operational costs for ensuring no flooding below the T-year level. The value of the return period T that corresponds to the minimum of the sum of these costs will then be the optimal adaptation level. The change in climate, however, is expected to continue in the next century, which calls for expansion of the above model. The change can be expressed in terms of a climate factor (the ratio between the future and the current design level) which is assumed to increase in time. This implies increasing costs of flooding in the future for many places in the world. The optimal adaptation level is found for immediate as well as for delayed adaptation.

As seen in two optimization models supported by the state of California, CALVIN and INFORM, the operation of the optimization function of computer models depends on a virtual system of rules that are centrally controlled, coordinated, nimble, and without the possibility of conflict (let alone conflict resolution). But that smooth virtual system comes with a real cost.

Consideration is given to the role that climatic variability has on the determination of a climatically representative period with which to evaluate the safe yield. The methods employed to estimate the safe yield are consistent with its definition as a long-term average extraction rate that avoids adverse impacts on groundwater. The safe yield is a useful baseline for groundwater planning; yet, it is herein shown that it is not an operational rule that works well under all climatic conditions. This paper shows that due to the nature of dynamic groundwater processes it may be most appropriate to use an adaptive groundwater management strategy that links groundwater extraction rates to groundwater discharge rates, thus achieving a safe yield that represents an estimated long-term sustainable yield.

A comprehensive assessment of empirical and theoretical evidence identified how each of these processes is likely to be shaped by climate change for alien plants, animals and pathogens in terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments of Great Britain. The strongest contemporary evidence for the potential role of climate change in the establishment of new alien species is for terrestrial arthropods, as a result of their ectothermic physiology, often high dispersal rate and their strong association with trade as well as commensal relationships with human environments. By contrast, there is little empirical support for higher temperatures increasing the rate of alien plant establishment due to the stronger effects of residence time and propagule pressure. The magnitude of any direct climate effect on the number of new alien species will be small relative to human-assisted introductions driven by socioeconomic factors. Casual alien species (sleepers) whose population persistence is limited by climate are expected to exhibit greater rates of establishment under climate change assuming that propagule pressure remains at least at current levels. Surveillance and management targeting sleeper pests and diseases may be the most cost-effective option to reduce future impacts under climate change. Most established alien species will increase their distribution range in Great Britain over the next century. However, such range increases are very likely be the result of natural expansion of populations that have yet to reach equilibrium with their environment, rather than a direct consequence of climate change. To assess the potential realised range of alien species will require a spatially explicit approach that not only integrates bioclimatic suitability and population-level demographic rates but also simulation of landscape-level processes (e.g. dispersal, land-use change, host/habitat distribution, non-climatic edaphic constraints). In terms of invasive alien species that have known economic or biodiversity impacts, the taxa that are likely to be the most responsive are plant pathogens and insect pests of agricultural crops. However, the extent to which climate adaptation strategies lead to new crops, altered rotations, and different farming practices (e.g. irrigation, fertilization) will all shape the potential agricultural impacts of alien species. The greatest uncertainty in the effects of climate change on biological invasions exists with identifying the future character of new species introductions and predicting ecosystem impacts. Two complementary strategies may work under these conditions of high uncertainty: (i) prioritise ecosystems in terms of their perceived vulnerability to climate change and prevent ingress or expansion of alien species therein that may exacerbate problems; (ii) target those ecosystem already threatened by alien species and implement management to prevent the situation deteriorating under climate change.",2017.0,WILEY,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,"Climate change and biological invasions: evidence, expectations, and response options",Biology,Philip E.,Philip,0.0,0.0

In addition, we find that the number of people facing substantial expected damage will, on average, increase more than eight-fold over the next 60 years.

This comment describes India as a premature power in climate politics, locates Indian climate negotiating positions in global context, and develops a balance sheet of India's gains and losses in the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement has received a lukewarm reaction in India because it runs against some key principles of Indian climate politics. However, the Paris Agreement requires assessment by a different set of metrics. Instead of principle-driven changes in national actions, the Paris Agreement architecture relies on inducing changes through procedural commitments and supportive mechanisms. Viewed from this perspective, the Paris Agreement brings some signs of hope for India. The bottom-up contributions should allow India to safeguard development and explore more linkages between development and climate objectives. Even while inadequate, the existing pledges do collectively set an upper bound on catastrophic climate change, although the introduction of a 1.5 degrees goal induces cynicism among Indian stakeholders. The transparency, expert review, and stocktake processes, when combined with regular updates of nationally determined contributions, are designed to ramp up contributions over time.

Recurrent drought and invasive encroaching plants are taking out plants that have cultural importance, and threaten the biodiversity and the associated traditional knowledge. Thus, the aim of the current study is to conduct an ethnobotanical survey and document medicinal and edible plants in Yalo Woreda in Afar regional state. Methods: A cross-sectional ethnobotanical study was carried out in eight kebeles of Yalo Woreda from October 2015 to December 2016. One hundred sixty informants were selected using purposive sampling. The data on diseases, medicinal and edible plants were collected using semi-structure interview and group discussion. The statistical methods, informant consensus factor, fidelity level, and preference ranking were conducted to analyze the data. Results: One hundred and six plants were reported; gender and age differences had implication on the number of plants reported by informants. The knowledge of medicinal plants among informants of each kebele was not different (p < 0.5) and was not associated in particular with the religious establishment in the kebeles (informant* kebeles, Eta square = 0.19). Family Fabaceae was the major plant species, and shrubs (44%) were dominant plants reported. Leaf (52.94%) and oral (68%) were primary plant part used for remedy preparation and route of application, respectively. The plants with low fidelity values Indigofera articulata (0.25), Cadaba farinosa (0.22), Cadaba rotundifolia (0.19), and Acalypha fruticosa (0.15) were used to treat the category of diseases with high informant consensus value (0.69).

By the 1970s, international hazard scholarship advocated regulating land use as an effective flood mitigation tool. In 1974, floods devastated Southeast Queensland and highlighted the hazards of building on floodplains. Drawing on scholarship that frames floods as a cultural, rather than natural event, this paper shows that the state government of Queensland prioritised property development and continued to rely on dam building as a way of controlling floods. Dams were built with the aim of providing immunity from flooding, but tensions between State and local governments allowed both to evade responsibility for the growing hazard arising from continuing development in the floodplain. When legislation and regulations were introduced to control floodplain development, they reflected popular sentiment against land use restrictions and hence were limited in scope, non-mandatory, and riddled with loopholes. The results of these inadequate land use regulations and continued residential development below the 100-year flood level were fully exposed in 2011 when a substantial increase in damages accompanied flooding of the Brisbane River.

Can the current generation of farm animals cope with the changes or should it be specifically selected for changing conditions? In general, genetic selection produces animals with a smaller environmental footprint but also with smaller environmental flexibility. Some answers are coming from heat-stress research across species, with heat tolerance partly understood as a greater environmental flexibility. Specific studies in various species show the complexities of defining and selecting for heat tolerance. In Holsteins, the genetic component for effect of heat stress on production approximately doubles in second and quadruples in third parity. Cows with elevated body temperature have the greatest production under heat stress but probably are at risk for increased mortality. In hot but less intensive environments, the effect of heat stress on production is minimal, although the negative effect on fertility remains. Mortality peaks under heat stress and increases with parity. In Angus, the effect of heat stress is stronger only in selected regions, probably because of adaptation of calving seasons to local conditions and crossbreeding. Genetically, the direct effect shows variability because of heat stress, but the maternal effect does not, probably because dams shield calves from environmental challenges. In pigs, the effect of heat stress is strong for commercial farms but almost nothing for nucleus farms, which have lower pig density and better heat abatement. Under intensive management, heat stress is less evident in drier environments because of more efficient cooling. A genetic component of heat stress exists, but it is partly masked by improving management and selection based on data from elite farms. Genetic selection may provide superior identification of heat-tolerant animals, but a few cycles may be needed for clear results. Also, simple traits exist that are strongly related to heat stress (e.g., slick hair in dairy cattle and shedding intensity in Angus). Defining resilience may be difficult, especially when masked by improving environment. Under climate change, the current selection strategies may be adequate if they 1) are accompanied by constantly improving management, 2) use commercial data, and 3) include traits important under climate change (e.g., mortality).",2017.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,Agriculture,BREEDING AND GENETICS SYMPOSIUM: Resilience and lessons from studies in genetics of heat stress,Agriculture,I.,,,

I estimate the demand for security in water rights through their capitalization in agricultural property markets in the Yakima River Basin, a major watershed in Washington State. All water rights are satisfied in an average year, so the relative value of secure property rights is a function of water supply volatility and the costs of droughts are predominantly born by those with weak rights. In aggregate, security in water rights does not capitalize into property values at the irrigation district level; however, there is heterogeneity in the premiumfor secure water rights. The lack of a premiumfor district-level water security is robust to a variety of econometric methods to account for correlated district unobservables, and the null result produces an economically significant upper bound on the value to water security for the district. The ability for farmers to adapt to water supply volatility, as well as expectations about water markets and government infrastructure investment, are leading explanations for the lack of an aggregate premium. These explanations are supported by the pattern of heterogeneity in the water security premium.",2017.0,WILEY,Agriculture,THE VALUE OF HETEROGENEOUS PROPERTY RIGHTS AND THE COSTS OF WATER VOLATILITY,Agriculture,Daniel A.,Daniel,0.0,0.0

National-level estimates of the technically accessible CO2 storage resource (TASR) onshore in the United States are on the order of thousands of gigatons of CO2 storage capacity, but such estimates generally assume away any pressure management issues. Pressure buildup in the storage reservoir is expected to be a primary source of risk associated with CO2 storage, and only a fraction of the theoretical TASR could be available unless the storage operator extracts the saltwater brines or other formation fluids that are already present in the geologic pore space targeted for CO2 storage.

This paper investigates which frames have characterised the positions of finance ministries on key issues in the climate finance negotiations, and whether the use of a given frame corresponds to particular factors. Case studies of Denmark, India, Indonesia and the USA based on official documents and interviews show that the position of each finance ministry is generally consistent with one particular frame. The Indonesian and Danish finance ministries predominantly framed climate finance as a way of correcting a market failure. The Indian Ministry of Finance emphasised Common but Differentiated Responsibilitieswi, which fits with the budget frame. The US Treasury's position similarly fits th the budget frame while sharing elements of the market failure frame. Finance ministries that had the lead on climate finance were more likely follow the budget frame. The use of both frames cuts across the divide between industrialised and emerging economies.

The adjustment is alley cropping, which is a low-input adjustment that has the potential to result in both adaptation and mitigation benefits, and furthermore, to enhance food security. The findings show that a CSA-adjustment in small-scale maize production in Maya villages in southern Belize is possible in principle, though several barriers can make the overall climate-smart objective difficult to implement in practice. The barriers are of a proximate and indirect nature, exist at different spatial scales, and involve various levels of governance. The barriers are shown to be land tenure, market access, and changes in the traditional culture, however, these barriers are not homogenous across the villages in the region. To break down the barriers an overall district-level strategy is possible, but the toolbox should contain a wide variety of approaches.

This paper compares selected cases of successful and failed Paleolithic groups of hunter-gatherers, as recorded archaeologically across Eurasia and Africa, in responding to the impacts of abrupt climatic changes. The complex prehistory of Pleistocene foragers is briefly compared to strategies adopted by Neolithic farmers. The major difference between forager and farmer economies is not their social organization as much as the access options to alternative territories and food resources. Open Pleistocene landscapes across Eurasia and Africa allowed for movements of Paleolithic groups over large distances with or without adopting new exploitation techniques. Successes and failures that we measure in a chronological macro-scale left archaeological evidence ( lithic assemblages, faunal remains, occasional flimsy dwellings, etc.) in various regions, recorded by systematic and comprehensive surveys and excavations. However, we miss the chronological micro-scale of most of the Paleolithic period that could inform us about extinctions. We can identify only survival stories explained as successful adaptations. When farming communities were established during the course of the Holocene, variable modes of social and economic interactions and group resilience evolved in order to secure survival in years of bad harvests. Interactions with foragers and herders, competition, raids, village abandonment, migration into others' territories, were among the optional strategies. Due to the difference in chronological scales between 2.6 Ma of the Paleolithic period and the 12 Ka of the Holocene (or Anthropocene), we can more easily recognize the role of abrupt climatic changes among prehistoric societies during the Terminal Pleistocene and the Holocene and evaluate the success and failure of both, hunter-gatherers and farmers.

Typically, these processes rely on climate experts and policy-makers to define what is at risk, and therefore what is worthy of investment and protection. Emerging approaches to community-based adaptation-planning advocate for stronger community control over these processes. Drawing on a place-based approach to adaptation, this paper examines place meaning as a co-constructed process. It explores how this process shapes opportunities for community-based climate action in Churchill, Canada. Results indicate that community members acknowledge many competing threats to their sense of place, and suggest that this competition may reduce the perceived need to prioritise climate action to protect connections to place. Results also reveal a concern among community members that local place identity has been appropriated for economic gain, which may further reduce the drive to act in protection of an already exploited sense of place.

Enhanced supply stability through a reduction in the year-to-year variability of US corn yield would greatly benefit global food security. Important in this regard is to understand how corn yield variability has evolved geographically in the history and how it relates to climatic and non-climatic factors. Results showed that year-to-year variation of US corn yield has decreased significantly during 1980-2010, mainly in Midwest Corn Belt, Nebraska and western arid regions. Despite the country-scale decreasing variability, corn yield variability exhibited an increasing trend in South Dakota, Texas and Southeast growing regions, indicating the importance of considering spatial scales in estimating yield variability. The observed pattern is partly reproduced by process-based crop models, simulating larger areas experiencing increasing variability and underestimating the magnitude of decreasing variability. And 3 out of 11 models even produced a differing sign of change from observations. Hence, statistical model which produces closer agreement with observations is used to explore the contribution of climatic and non-climatic factors to the changes in yield variability. It is found that climate variability dominate the change trends of corn yield variability in the Midwest Corn Belt, while the ability of climate variability in controlling yield variability is low in southeastern and western arid regions. Irrigation has largely reduced the corn yield variability in regions (e.g. Nebraska) where separate estimates of irrigated and rain-fed corn yield exist, demonstrating the importance of non-climatic factors in governing the changes in corn yield variability. The results highlight the distinct spatial patterns of corn yield variability change as well as its influencing factors at the county scale.

Common to most definitions are the following elements: the probability of a future event; and the consequences of the event, usually with respect to some predefined human value. Risk analysis includes elements of risk assessment (quantification of risk), uncertainty (of the event and its consequences), risk management (reducing risk to an acceptable level), and development of policy to balance finite resources with uncertainty and risk tolerance. When biological invasion and its risk are jointly examined, it is common that the consequences of invasion are not explicitly quantified, but understood to be sufficiently negative that it must be minimized to the extent possible. Risk analysis then becomes quantification of the probabilities of an introduction (event) and that the introduction leads to establishment, and the uncertainty of those probabilities. I describe a risk analysis framework for the Asian gypsy moth-a known invader-in its pathway. The framework uses the available information regarding the transportation route of the vector (ships), and a phenology model that estimates vector contamination (propagule size), the probability of introduction, and the probability of initial establishment given an introduction. Reducing propagule pressure is arguably the most important factor in reducing biological invasion; propagule pressure can be reduced by inspection and sanitation of the pathway vector (e.g., ships, trucks, humans) at the point(s) of departure and at the point of entry. I demonstrate how the risk analysis framework can be used to more efficiently target incoming ships for inspection and propagule pressure reduction.",2017.0,SPRINGER,Biodiversity & Conservation,Risk analysis of the invasion pathway of the Asian gypsy moth: a known forest invader,Biology,David R.,David,0.0,0.0

The framework was tested by considering the migration system of the northwestern populations of Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia leucorodia), characterized by mid-long-range movements between the breeding sites in the Netherlands and wintering sites in Spain, Senegal and Mauritania. Climate effects suggest an ever-increasing range of distances to cover by the spoonbills, increasing the separation between important stopover and wintering areas.

Thus, a global consensus now sees the need for a supplemental plan to deal with the kind of harms that cannot be avoided-what Parties call 'loss and damage'. For a loss-and-damage plan to work, it must be capable of carrying the load, the load being whatever minimal standards that morality and political consensus require. But if residual risk climbs too high, it will fall short of even the most basic expectations. The Paris Agreement calls for holding the rise in global average temperature to 'well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels', while working to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees C. How much difference is in that half-degree? From the point of view of residual risk, quite a lot. According to a 2016 study published by the European Geosciences Union, a jump from 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C could produce outsize impacts, particularly in tropical latitudes. That difference could mark the line between a plan that is politically and morally defensible and one that is not. At the very least, the difference is enough to inform the design and expectations of any future plan.

The wine industry is concerned about sustainability in both senses: it confronts threats from sustainability issues, such as climate change, chemical exposure and water and energy availability and its activities have their own impacts. In this sense, understanding sustainability in the wine world requires identifying definitions and principles, but also a review of current practices. This paper sets forth a cross-country analysis about current sustainability assessment frameworks in six countries (South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, US, Chile and France) in order to identify their main aspects, drivers and issues. A cross-analysis discusses the presentation, the scale, the scope, the governance, the deepness, the learning potential and the content, in a cross-disciplinary perspective. The common grounds are summarized in terms of main indicators linked with official guidelines. Most of the frameworks are certifications or labels in voluntary programs, using a qualitative approach to check compliance with guidelines, without proposing the improvement of sustainability performance. They are more focused on operation and on mitigating impact. All frameworks have indicators considering the main environmental issues to the wine industry. The frameworks development should move toward a more effective proposition for improving wine sustainability, in order to answer to the operational challenges with a strategic thinking.

This paper addresses the assignment challenge in drought adaptation, namely the challenge of assigning and coordinating governance responsibilities across nested levels of social organisation. The subsidiarity principle suggests that adaptation decisions and associated governance responsibilities should occur at the lowest level at which they can be performed competently. Droughts and related slow-onset 'shocks' throw into question which level is lowest, and how this varies with the duration, severity and extent of the event. This paper explores the potential for the subsidiarity principle to guide the assignment and assessment of governance responsibilities associated with drought adaptation. It reviews literature at the intersection of common pool resource studies and new institutional economics to elaborate four diagnostic questions: (1) what are the opportunities and limits of decentralised (independent) drought adaptation?; (2) how are social dilemmas and spillovers associated with drought adaptation managed?; (3) when do higher level institutions complement versus crowd out decentralised adaptation?; and (4) how does adaptation by individuals and groups affect adaptive efficiency? An illustrative comparison of drought adaptation in the US portions of the Colorado and Rio Grande Rivers of North America demonstrates: (i) the potential and limits of decentralised adaptation through urban water conservation and irrigation efficiency (ii) the importance of both formal and informal coordination institutions (e.g. river basin organisations) to address cross-border externalities, including conflicts and economies of scale, and (iii) the pivotal role of groundwater management for adaptive efficiency, requiring a balance between local, short-term dependence on groundwater for drought adaptation with transboundary, long-term outcomes caused by unsustainable extractions.",2018.0,"IGITUR, UTRECHT PUBLISHING & ARCHIVING SERVICES",Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Decentralisation and drought adaptation: applying the subsidiarity principle in transboundary river basins,Environmental studies & forestry,Dustin E.,Dustin,0.0,0.0

Much has happened in less than 10 years to redefine the international nutrition landscape and place nutrition at the heart of global development efforts. The food crises of 2008 and the Lancet first series on maternal and child undernutrition helped galvanize world attention. The enormous health and economic consequences of malnutrition were recognized, and far more attention began to be paid to the multiple burdens of malnutrition. In 2014, the Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2) endorsed 2 outcome documents, committing world leaders to establishing national policies aimed at eliminating malnutrition in all its forms, including hidden hunger, and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. In 2015, 193 Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global objectives to guide the actions of the international community over the next 15 years (2016-2030). Member States placed high priority on addressing malnutrition in all its forms by committing, under SDG 2, to ""end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture."" However, nutrition has also a role to play in achieving other goals of the 2030 Agenda, including goals related to poverty, health, education, social protection, gender, water, work, growth, inequality, and climate change. In 2016, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the ICN2 outcome documents and proclaimed the years 2016-2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Nutrition Decade reaffirmed the commitments under the ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda to end malnutrition in all its forms. Together, the ICN2, the 2030 Agenda, and the Nutrition Decade have placed nutrition firmly at the heart of the development agenda with the recognition that transformed food systems have a fundamental role to play in promoting healthy diets and improving nutrition.

The institutional changes that follow the introduction of a CCA measure affect certain areas of governance, including social, political, policy, and other domains that are already exposed to prevailing institutions. Thus, understanding CCA necessitates analysis of the interplays between and among institutions that exist within a hierarchical structure, as well as the examination of how institutions across different scales define the challenges in CCA implementation. This article contributes to this discussion by investigating the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. It applies a four-stage mixed methodology and uses a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as its primary analytical guide. Its findings imply that: (1) mainstreaming CCA is a multi-scale, multi-setting endeavour; (2) mainstreaming CCA operationalization involves networks of interacting institutions and institutional arrangements; and (3) addressing the challenges in mainstreaming needs extensive institutional transformations that reach across the various institutional settings within these networks.POLICY RELEVANCEThis article advocates that, in designing strategies to address the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, analysts, planners, and policy makers must understand that the challenges exist within a network of institutional settings, and that these challenges encompass a chain of institutional interactions or interplays within this network. Accordingly, overcoming these challenges necessitates broad institutional reforms that go beyond the institutional setting where CCA is to be mainstreamed. Moreover, this article suggests that CCA policy making and analysis must focus on the vertical, horizontal, and network linkages and relationships created by institutional arrangements, as well as on the interplays facilitated by these arrangements. More importantly, there is a need to determine whether the institutional interplays between and among existing and planned institutions are complementary, counterproductive, conflicting, overlapping, neutral, or coexisting. Such knowledge will assist policy makers and analysts to understand the existing and potential barriers to, as well as identify opportunities for, adaptation. Consequently, the solutions to address the barriers, and the strategies that can take advantage of the opportunities, can be formulated effectively.",2018.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Institutional dimensions of climate change adaptation: insights from the Philippines,Environmental studies & forestry,Sining C.,Sining,,

A participatory approach involving capacity building at the community-level, leads to the development of ` socially modified crops' which deliver multiple environmental, social and economic benefits, suggesting that increased agricultural production does not have to be detrimental to biodiversity, to agroecological function, and/ or to climate change.

Global policies prove the need to undertake action in order to develop more sustainable human settlements, which would be adapted better to potential future climate change effects. Among such changes are the increase of average temperatures and extreme events like heat waves. Those changes are more severe in urban areas due to land use development, and result in the urban heat island effect (UHI), which has a negative impact on the thermal comfort of citizens.

In short, the recent food price shocks make gainers and losers. The complexity of the concerns is examined in a political economy analysis of the phenomenon. More specifically, countries have been differentiated according to their degrees of vulnerability to the rising food prices. The second step examined the heterogeneities in the macroeconomic effects of the rising food prices on malnutrition, public spending, current account balances and food production in developing countries, emphasising the specificities of African countries, the position of the countries as food importers or exporters, as oil exporters or not and finally on the political climate-conflict or post-conflict-that prevailed right before 1995-2006. The findings are that food inflation increases malnutrition, pushes up public spending and dampens the current account balances in vulnerable countries, whereas it constitutes a financial opportunity for less vulnerable countries and/or for vulnerable but net food-exporting countries. While oil exports absorb the negative effects of food price shocks, African specificities tend to magnify those effects. Actual responses of countries remain limited in number, despite the great number of policy options that have been designed by international organisations. While severe budget constraints are binding on the use of safety nets, administrative policies often constrain the considered economy.

It also finds that most adaptations are being undertaken in the coastal zone and the water and agriculture sectors, and that there are many factors limiting national-level adaptation. The most commonly reported limit is financing, though not all policy-makers agree that financing is a limit. These findings are important for national SIDS governments and international donors and agencies that will be better able to identify and fill gaps in their adaptation actions and financing.

Respondents' perceptions are sensitive to observed differences in both temperature and precipitation, but respondents are more likely to accurately perceive local precipitation than local temperature. Controlling for observed conditions, beliefs about global climate change had a large effect on perceptions of seasonal temperature, and smaller effects on perceptions of seasonal precipitation.

This study addresses this question by exploiting a natural experiment in water distribution and allocation rules during shortage among a stratified sample of 60 snowmelt dependent irrigation systems in the San Luis Valley of Colorado during a four-year drought period from 2011-2014. A key finding is that the combination of rotational delivery and flexible water allocations produces the most equal crop growth between irrigators at the head and tail of the irrigation system at all levels of water availability. The marginal productivity of water at the head and tail end of irrigation systems at all levels of water availability is also equalized under this configuration. These results suggest a greater likelihood of ongoing collective action, important for climate change adaptation. However, rotation with flexible allocations is outperformed by other configurations depending on context. These findings highlight the configurational relationships between rules, further illustrate interactions between rules and physical context, and caution against panaceas in water resource management and climate change adaptation.",2018.0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Flexible water allocations and rotational delivery combined adapt irrigation systems to drought,Environmental studies & forestry,Kelsey C.,Kelsey,0.625,

Smallholder farmers who depend on rain-fed agriculture are heavily affected and it is important to understand what they think about the problem and its impacts so that remedial measures can be tailored to address the same. Hence this study explores how farmers and policy-makers in Ethiopia conceived climate change, factors contributing to it and its impacts. The study is based on a field research conducted from January to May 2012 in Sidama's three agroecological zones (AEZs), namely, the highlands, midlands and lowlands. It deployed both qualitative and quantitative research method. Data collection involved (a) semi-structured interviews with 15 farmers and 17 policy-makers, (b) focus group discussion with 30 farmers, and (c) a survey of 120 farmers. The novelty of the study lies in exploring and comparing two sets of views (that of local people and the policy-makers) on climate change. Findings revealed that farmers clearly perceived climate risks based on their experience and knowledge of their local environment. The commonly cited indicators of change include high temperature, rainfall, seasonal shifts and incidence of certain diseases. Farmers also identified specific indicators such as change in wind direction, disappearance of plant (crop and tree) species, growing hitherto unfamiliar crops and emergence of new parasites and weeds. Their perceptions of causes of climate change are mixed: deforestation, God's wrath, human activities, and weakened indigenous practices and values. On the other hand, participants from policy-making community espoused views shared by scientific discourse such as deforestation, global warming and CO2 emissions. The gap in understanding needs to be bridged by information and education of the local public with the policy-makers paying attention to the importance of indigenous knowledge.",2018.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Development Studies,Farmers and policy-makers' perceptions of climate change in Ethiopia,Interdisciplinary,Seyoum,Seyoum,0.0,0.0

One approach that has been proposed to close this ambition gap is the building blocks strategy, which aims to encourage initiatives focused on non-climate actions that can deliver a climate benefit. A key option under this framework is reducing global nitrogen pollution. Nitrogen pollution-driven largely by the inefficient use of synthetic fertilizer and manure-is one of the most important environmental issues of the twenty-first century, not least because of its climate impacts. Ambitiously mitigating nitrogen pollution could avoid greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 5-10% of the remaining allowable emissions consistent with the 2 A degrees C target. However, the climate benefits would be a minor component of the overall environmental benefits of reducing nitrogen pollution, which would come mainly from avoided water and air pollution. The fact that these benefits would accrue mostly at local scales is especially important for countries like the United States, marked by a shift toward ""economic nationalism."" In these countries, the most politically viable climate actions will likely be ones that produce local benefits as great, if not greater, than those achieved internationally. This is also likely to be true in countries like China, where local nitrogen-related issues such as air and water pollution remain major national priorities. Nevertheless, there are several challenges that could stand in the way of improved nitrogen management being a successful building block: integrated nitrogen management solutions that reduce the risk of pollution swapping need to be developed, the policy challenges related to changing and monitoring farmer behavior need to be addressed, and nitrogen's role as an essential agricultural input needs to be respected.

Moreover, the risks of termination shock and unilateral deployment are overstated. On the other hand, SAI introduces risks of interstate conflict which are very difficult to quantify.

A review of existing literature is presented on tools and methods for qualitative and quantitative assessment of organic matter in soil originating from various sources for reasonable soil management, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances in organic matter transformations and new research directions for modeling. Diverse tools and methods for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of organic matter in soil coming from diverse sources have been adopted so far to express transformation processes. For the qualitative analysis of SOM and humic acids (HAs), the analytical techniques are applied, e.g., HPSEC, NMR, and ESI-FTICRMS. The quantitative analysis is done through the following parameters: humification index (HI), humification degree (HD), and humification rate (HR). These analyses indicated that because of lack of reliable data from sufficiently long-term experiments, mathematical modeling may be applied as a numerical tool for quantitative estimation and prediction of humification of SOM. The effective soil management should include soil properties as well as different functions: food production, nutrient and water cycling, storage, filtrating, buffering, biological habitat, gene pool, source of raw materials, climate regulations, heritage, platform for man-made structure. The soil utility value should be evaluated through the SOM qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic carbon and total nitrogen. Knowledge about dynamics of SOM transformations is essential, particularly in the context of stability and efficiency of different sources of organic matter applied into soil. A qualitative understanding of SOM dynamics transformations along with modeling for quantitative assessment of HS formation should be used to develop sustainable soil management. The modeling may be considered as a tool for predicting SOM humification dynamics and consequently the formation of HSs from the diverse sources. The existing archival data from a long-term experiment may be used to build and calibrate the reliable mathematical model of SOM humification. Managing of SOM remains a sound basis for maintaining soil in a good condition for optimizing productivity. The development of land management strategies to optimize both the increase of soil organic carbon levels and the recycling of nutrients from SOM needs to be a priority.

Although current scientific evidence finds some patterns of climate change impacts on agriculture in the future that can inform the analysis of where and when transformation is required, this evidence is not enough to fully inform practical decision-making at different scales. Part of the problem may be that there has been not enough empirical research focusing on transformational agriculture. For example, from 93 articles in the literature, 39% focus on understanding the concept of TA, 32% focus on analytical and applied aspects of TA, including studies applying global climate models to analyze TA at regional and global scales and to identify broad patterns of TA in agriculture, and only 16% have tried to understand TA from an empirical perspective. While the number of empirical studies of TA is still increasing, there are other issues of TA that have received limited attention, including uncertainty of climate change impacts, policy implications, the transition process, the role of technological innovations, and barriers to TA.

Sea level rise, extreme events, loss of biodiversity, water stress among other direct and indirect impacts pose potential danger for the tourism industry. Although mitigation to reduce GHGs is equally important, adaptation is urgent. The need for urgent adaptation to climate change has triggered tourism stakeholders and the research community to develop generic adaptation framework(s) for national, regional or local tourism destinations. These frameworks are used to guide tourism policy makers in the adaptation process with an aim of reducing destination's vulnerability and to increase their resilience. Whilst some destinations are already implementing planed adaptation using these frameworks, caution has been raised that current adaptation strategies sought are far from sustainable. Assuming that the frameworks are the guiding tools for adaptation we hereby question their suitability in achieving sustainable adaptation. Sustainable adaptation in this context refers to those approaches that reduce destination's vulnerability and increase resilience without jeopardizing its economic viability, social justice and environmental integrity.

Claims are laid on how the existing tourism adaptation frameworks fail to fulfil the basic principles of sustainable adaptation. Further attempts are made to propose an enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework. The framework is a significant contribution in two ways. First it contributes to the new school of thought, on sustainable adaptation, where knowledge is lacking and secondly, it provides a practical tool for sustainable adaptation that may be used by destination managers and policy makers in the adaptation process.

As we stand at the cusp of a vital moment in the global response, I suggest the need for a concerted effort to direct more, and more sustained, attention to the last of these. I argue that careful, critical, and creative thinking with respect to the power relations shaping the role of cities as global climate governors offers a means through which scholars can best contribute to augmenting the capacity for a just and effective urban contribution to the global effort.

The second proposition is that federal institutions that have incorporated resilience planning have done so with a focus on extreme events and social effects and have given little attention to long-term transformative adaptation by and between social and natural systems.

These resources are crucial as a means for mitigating, coping, and responding to impacts of natural disturbances. The Vietnamese Government has formulated policies aimed at achieving dual objectives of socio-economic development and environmental protection through the expansion of plantation forests.

However, few studies have examined these issues at the local level or analysed the interplay between plantation forest expansion, household vulnerability, and community resilience to climatic disturbances. The article documents the extent to which the introduction of acacia tree species has reinforced existing inequalities in landholding, which in turn increases household vulnerability to natural disturbances. This has resulted in the emergence of a social-ecological context characterized by decreasing resilience. The most vulnerable households are those of the landless and ethnic minorities, both of which depend on short-term insecure income from casual labour. A growing concentration of landholdings, coupled with a commune economy based on monoculture plantations, threatens resilience and potentially could constrain future government development interventions.",2014.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Geography,Plantation livelihoods in central Vietnam: Implications for household vulnerability and community resilience,Geography,Andreas Waaben,Andreas,0.0,0.0

At the same time, dominant policy and scholarly approaches to adaptation remain apolitical and pay inadequate attention to the links between structural vulnerability and adaptive capacity. Using a case study from the dynamic wetland environment of the Okavango Delta, Botswana, this paper draws on work in political ecology, vulnerability studies, and the emerging field of transformative adaptation to emphasise the need for an anticipatory approach to adaptation. While flooding variability is an inherent part of life in the Okavango Delta, high floods in 2009, 2010 and 2011 displaced hundreds of residents from their homes and inundated many floodplain agricultural fields past the point of production. A combination of household interviews, participant observation sessions, and household surveys was used to investigate the impacts of these flooding events, responses to them, and the implications of those responses. Findings reveal that the Government of Botswana began to regulate wetland-based livelihoods more strictly during the years the high floods occurred, and to encourage residents to switch permanently to dryland livelihoods. While these state-sponsored strategies appear to be practical responses to flooding variability, they ultimately result in decreased adaptive capacity for some people, especially members of the Bayei tribe. This group typically subsists from wetland-based livelihoods and has strong cultural ties to the waters of the Delta. By situating these findings within the historical context of marginalisation of ethnic minorities and rural communities in the country, and considering them in the light of predictions of future increases in environmental variability in the Okavango Delta, the paper identifies sites of potential transformation that would lead to improved adaptive capacities for vulnerable groups, in advance of the most significant impacts of climate change.",2018.0,WILEY,Geography,"Toward anticipatory adaptation: Transforming social-ecological vulnerabilities in the Okavango Delta, Botswana",Geography,Jamie E.,Jamie,0.75,1.0

A review of the hypotheses that form the basis for this two-dimensional model suggests that the assumption of net sand transfer to the nearshore profile and deposition of a thickness of sediment equal to the rise in sea level is probably incorrect. Moreover, the model omits consideration of a significant component of the coastal sediment budget, namely the dune sediment budget, and the processes associated with beachdune interaction. An alternative conceptual model is developed on the basis of a two-dimensional equilibrium profile similar to that which forms the basis for the Bruno Model. The proposed model incorporates consideration of the dune sediment budget and foredune dynamics. In contrast to the Bruun Model, it predicts no net transfer of sediment to the nearshore profile and preservation of the foredune through landward migration. It is argued that the model proposed here offers a better starting point for developing more realistic models of shoreline response to sea level rise that incorporate consideration of alongshore sediment transfers and more complex coastal morphology and sediment characteristics.

Due to its characteristics, Spain is among the most vulnerable countries to climate change in the European Union (EU). Thus, spatial planning is considered one of the main instruments available to manage sustainable adaptation to climate change. This article presents an assessment framework for exploring climate change impacts using participatory geographic information systems (PGISs)-multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) spatial planning with the preference ranking organization method for enrichment of evaluations (PROMETHEE) in sustainable land-use adaptation. Assessment planning applies to any agroforestry system at a regional level for a municipality with higher vulnerability. An indicator-based model with five categorical values was developed to assess twelve possible impacts from climate change and the main threats of climate change to water sources, agriculture, soil, and land management. This model is available to manage sustainable land-use adaptation priorities for climate change in a spatial context. The model discusses the likelihood of implementing and adopting strategies for climate change adaptation as assessed by a sensitivity analysis and a professional online survey. Among the five strategies, scenario A (suitability map) accounts for 8.84% of the priority areas (v) and 2.13% of the hot spots (i) and was the scenario most supported by professionals, while scenario D (priority to socioeconomic) accounts for 3.07% of the priority areas and 10.12% of the hotspots, and the lowest number of professionals supported this scenario. The results summarize foreseeable problems derived from climate change effects that require urgent adaptation activities through spatial land assessment planning. Thus, this study provides some recommendations and limitations from which decision-makers can select the most suitable arrangement for an agroforestry system to make it climate-resilient, and the study is applicable to similar geographical and spatial locations.",2018.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Agriculture,Design of spatial PGIS-MCDA-based land assessment planning for identifying sustainable land-use adaptation priorities for climate change impacts,Agriculture,Jin Su,Jin,0.2,0.0

The enactment of the 1998 Water Act and subsequent water allocation reforms were meant to correct equity challenges of the past in water allocation and increase agricultural productivity in the rural sector. More than 20 years after the initiation of the processes smallholder farmers remain poor with limited agricultural productivity. With the advent of more frequent droughts and the ever increasing climate change threat, the need to find lasting solutions for smallholder agriculture remains a priority for the government. So far the emphasis has been placed on water allocation, but could this be the only challenge to smallholder farmer livelihoods? South Africa is currently experiencing one of the worst droughts in history. Smallholder farmers who are already faced with water shortages have been the worst hit. The research sought to untangle some of the complexities of improving smallholder farmer livelihoods in the Breede-Gouritz Catchment Management Area (BGCMA) in the Western Cape, one of the first two catchment management areas to be created in South Africa. The main aim of the study was to assess constraints in addition to water, to the success of smallholder farmers in improving livelihoods. The specific objectives were to determine how institutional policies limited smallholder farmers from accessing resources in the Western Cape; to identify constraints affecting smallholder farmer performance and participation in agricultural activities. Interviews with farmers and key informants in government and other relevant institutions were conducted to determine how institutional arrangements have influenced and impacted the success of smallholder farmers. Results indicated uncoordinated institutional processes to support smallholder farmers resulting in limited participation by smallholder farmers in policy and strategy formulation. Farmer livelihoods were constrained by lack of information, limited access to water and lack of funding. The results and recommendations of the study were shared with the BGCMA and other relevant institutions with the aim of influencing future policy formulation for smallholder farmer livelihoods. The institutions decided to address the information gap through collaborative effort.

Deployment of improved engines is aided by the wide availability of well-defined fuels, sometimes with more stringent specification of properties such as the sulphur content and the vaporisation and combustion characteristics (e.g. the octane rating). Fuel regulation has also led to the inclusion of low-carbon fuel components such as ethanol and biodiesel in mainstream road fuels. These trends will probably continue over the next few decades, and so it is important to understand their implications for commercial-scale fuel production and distribution. This paper provides a technical explanation of the linkages between the properties of commercial-scale fuels, the technologies used to make them and the landscape' of the fuels industry (e.g. the distribution systems and the interlinked markets for non-fuel products and energy). Industrially relevant examples are used to explain how the refining industry has adapted, and is still adapting, to the changes in the sulphur and volatility specifications, the mandated biocontent and the changes in engine technology. This paper is not intended to make a case for any specific type of fuel but does aim to explain the principles by which refined fuels can be adapted to meet future specifications or to work in conjunction with alternative fuel components.

It is a complex process, and drought tolerance response is carried out by various genes, transcription factors, microRNAs, hormones, proteins, co-factors, ions and metabolites. This complexity has limited the development of crop cultivars for drought tolerance. Breeding for drought tolerance is further complicated because several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies, can challenge crop plants simultaneously. Although marker-assisted selection is now widely deployed in wheat, it has not contributed significantly to cultivar improvement for adaptation to low-yielding environments, and breeding has relied largely on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance in these difficult environments. Advances in plant breeding to produce improved and higher performing wheat cultivars are key to making dryland food-production systems more efficient and more resistant to pressure from drought, extremes of cold and heat, unpredictable rainfall, and new pests and diseases. For optimal performance, wheat cultivars can be targeted to specific farming systems, depending on local conditions and stresses. Genetic gain in wheat yield potential during the last century has been achieved by plant breeding and is well documented. It has been studied by comparing, in the same field trial, the yield of cultivars characterised by different years of release. Genomic selection (GS) and high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) have attracted the interest of plant breeders, and both approaches promise to revolutionise the prediction of complex traits, including growth, yield and adaptation to stress. This review describes the impact of drought on yield, trends in yield for boosting crop yields to meet the projected demands of rising global population by 2050, and genetic gain achieved by plant breeding in the last decades; and gathers known functional information on the genes, metabolites and traits and their direct involvement in conferring drought tolerance in wheat.

A potential solution to limit this problem is the increased uptake of SWHS as an alternative source of energy for providing hot water, displacing fossil fuel usage. SWHS are a comparatively modern technology; increased public awareness regarding the benefits attached to it is required to increase its adoption. The economic evaluation of SWHS is an essential assessment to conclude the feasibility of this system that may enhance public awareness of benefits attached to its adoption. This study presents cost benefit analysis of SWHS in residential sector of Islamabad, Pakistan. The results indicate that if SWHS replaces electric power and natural gas for water heating, it can save 430.95 Euro and 67.81 Euro of energy cost per annum per household, respectively. Depending on the initial installation cost of SWHS, the payback period varies from 1.16 to 1.38 years for electric power and 6.95-8.27 years for natural gas powered conventional water heating systems. Similarly, it can save 14.21 MMBtu of natural gas and an electric power of 4163.98 kWh annually which in turn reduces the emission of 2206.9 Mg CO2, 2.08 Kg SO2 and 3.75 Kg NOx per year.

Thirty-two samples were obtained down the length of the core, 19 from hemipelagic and mixed mud deposits considered to be the background record, and 13 others from displaced flow deposits. The pollen record obtained from the background samples documents variations in the terrestrial flora as it adapted to changing climatic conditions over the last 19,000 cal yrs BP. A Q-mode cluster analysis defined three pollen zones: a Glacial Pollen Zone (ca. 20,000-17,000 cal yr BP), an overlying Transitional Pollen Zone (ca. 17,000-11,500 cal yr BP), and an Interglacial Pollen Zone (ca. 11,500 cal yr BP to present). Another Q-mode cluster analysis, of both the background mud and flow deposits, also defined these three pollen zones, but four of the 13 turbiditic deposits were assigned to pollen zones older than expected by their stratigraphic position. This was due to these samples containing statistically significant fewer palynomorphs than the background muds as well as being enriched (similar to 10-35% in some cases) in hydraulically-efficient Pinus pollen. A selective bias in the pollen assemblage, such as demonstrated here, may result in incorrect interpretations (e.g., climatic shifts or environmental perturbations) based on the floral record, indicating turbiditic deposits should be avoided in marine palynological studies. Particularly in the case of fine-grained flow deposits that may not be visually distinct, granulometry and grain size frequency distribution curves may not be enough to identify these biased deposits.

However, both risk-based premiums and growing risk pose increasing difficulties for insurance to remain affordable. An empirical concept of affordability is required as the affordability of adaption strategies is an important concern for policymakers, yet such a concept is not often examined. Therefore, a robust metric with a commonly acceptable affordability threshold is required. A robust metric allows for a previously normative concept to be quantified in monetary terms, and in this way, the metric is rendered more suitable for integration into public policy debates. This paper investigates the degree to which risk-based flood insurance premiums are unaffordable in Europe. In addition, this paper compares the outcomes generated by three different definitions of unaffordability in order to investigate the most robust definition. In doing so, the residual income definition was found to be the least sensitive to changes in the threshold.

But in an increasingly interconnected world, a nontraditional form of regulatory litigation is possible in which public enforcers from one government enforce laws adopted by a second government in the second government's courts. That is, one government provides the executive while the second provides the legislature and the judiciary. I call this nontraditional form ""diagonal public enforcement."" ""Although diagonal public enforcement has escaped systematic study, one can find examples in U.S. courts going back more than a century. Foreign governments have used U.S. courts to enforce federal antitrust laws, state environmental laws, and civil rights statutes, among others. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case in which the European Community sued U.S. tobacco companies in a federal court in New York under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Diagonal public enforcement occurs within the U.S. system as well. States routinely enforce federal laws in federal courts, and opportunities exist for states to enforce sister-state law, especially with respect to climate change and other cross-border issues. Despite these examples, some view diagonal public enforcement as a category error: Why would legislatures rely on foreign governments to enforce domestic law, and why would foreign executives take up the task? In light of these questions, this Article attempts to demystify diagonal public enforcement by exploring when it is consistent with the rational pursuit of legislative and executive interests. Legislatures are likely to authorize diagonal public enforcement in order to increase deterrence or influence global regulation. Executives are likely to forum shop for diagonal options in order to achieve betteroutcomes in foreign courts. These predictions explain existing patterns of enforcement and suggest a larger role for diagonal public enforcement in the coming years. Finally, this Article critically evaluates the costs and benefits of diagonal public enforcement at the interstate, intrastate, and individual levels. At first glance, diagonal public enforcement may seem to raise concerns about the diffusion of regulatory authority, the extraterritorial reach of domestic law, and the interference in relationships with foreign sovereigns. Upon closer scrutiny, however, diagonal public enforcement turns out to have the capacity to improve enforcement efficacy, promote the public interest, protect foreign and minority interests, and nudge gridlocked institutions.

I find that ni-Vanuatu perspectives reflect an unwillingness to resettle as a result of climate change unless as a last resort, a prioritization of in-situ adaptation measures, and a preoccupation with maintaining cultural and livelihood links should resettlement occur. The implication of these findings is that policies that center these perspectives would allow for community control over movement-including the decision of whether to relocate at all.

Life at the shore shapes emergent social relationships, local traditions, and collective memory. At the same time, issues such as tourism development, demographic change, and national and international administrations influence how environmental challenges in coastal areas are addressed.

Strategies to combat outbreaks should ideally involve reliable monitoring, accurate detection and immediate intervention. This is particularly true for emerging diseases, which typically require rapid development and implementation of novel responses. However, developing countries often lack the capacity and infrastructure to monitor diseases fully and to implement appropriate mitigation strategies.

Using the highly contested development of seawater desalination for municipal water supply in the San Diego metropolitan region as an analytical entry point, the paper excavates divergent water-energy politics emerging in California. Two underlying paradigm shifts of water governance are identified. First, supply diversification represents an attempt to increase reliability through the development of multiple decentralised water sources. Second, the notion of a loading order is being promoted by certain groups as a way of prioritising different water source options according to sustainability criteria, including energy footprint. Drawing on the concept of the socio-ecological fix, the paper argues that seawater desalination - as a technological adaptation to water stress - occupies a paradoxical position, being consistent with diversification, but representing a water-energy trade-off inconsistent with the loading order. This has resulted, the paper suggests, in a polarised debate between desalination and wastewater recycling as alternative climate-independent sources of freshwater.

Significant environmental contrasts were diagnosed then specificities were pinpointed for each zone.

However such decisions are usually made under significant uncertainty due to local climate change and socio-economic impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed four global scenarios according to different representative concentration pathways (RCPs); however, using these scenarios directly is equivalent to using incomplete information in the decision-making process because they do not provide information on what sea level rise behavior is most probable. In this study, I propose a model which assigns probabilities to IPCC scenarios with Local Sea Level Rise (LSLR) information. I obtain expected damage and risk measures for the world's 120 major coastal mega-cities at specific moments in time. That is, I consider uncertainty in both scenario selection and within each scenario. With this information it is possible to make adaptation investment decisions under uncertainty with a criterion of not exceeding certain risk levels in the future. The paper shows that in the year 2100 for the equal probability mixed scenario (25% RCP 2.6, 50% RCP 4.5 and 25 RCP 8.5) the expected damage is US$ 1,251,732 millions for, New Orleans and US$ 1,196,517 millions for Guangzhou.

It has been documented that farmers in Tanzania use traditional practices such as terracing (matuta), ngolo, tree planting, and construction of locally based water reservoirs (nkunisa), mixed cropping and crop diversification.

Based on the ability of the strategy to improve the capacity of the communities to respond to climate change effects, ease of implementation, the affordability, the strategies have been categorized as sustainable or not. It has been noted that the use of the sustainable indigenous strategies can improve the management of climate change effects provided that the underlying limitations are overcome.

This paper examines the history of ways of thinking about the monsoon and risk, focusing on India. The science of meteorology, and a growing interest in ways to mitigate monsoon risk, developed in response to major famines. Piecemeal interventions, including a series of canals and small dams, began India's hydraulic transformation. By the middle of the twentieth century, massive hydraulic engineering emerged as the dominant solution to controlling the monsoon's risks. Large dams account for the largest share of government expenditure in independent India, but since the 1960s, intensive and mostly unregulated groundwater exploitation has played a greater role in meeting irrigation needs. The expansion in India's irrigated area and an expansion in food production. But this has come at a cost: millions have been displaced by dam construction; groundwater exploitation has reached unsustainable levels, and has had an effect on regional climate. South Asia's agriculture is unique in its dependence on the monsoon. More than 70 % of total rainfall in South Asia occurs during just three months each year, between June and September: much of it falls during just a hundred hours of rain. 1 Around 60 % of Indian agriculture is rain-fed, and 60 % of India's population is employed in agriculture. A shift in the monsoon represents the gravest threat that climate change poses to lives and livelihoods in South Asia. From the earliest times, the monsoon has been a source of economic uncertainty in India. In the nineteenth century the growing economic importance of India to the British Empire, the consequent intrusion of the colonial state into Indian agriculture, and the experience of devastating famines all put a premium on weather prediction. Agricultural officials and investors both sought to turn the uncertainty of the monsoon into calculable risk. It is no coincidence that meteorology and economic forecasting developed in tandem in colonial India. G.F. Wilson, financial member of the Viceroy's council, said in 1909 that BI recognise that estimating in this country is largely a gamble in rain."" Beginning in the 1940s, and building on colonial precedents, colossal hydraulic engineering emerged as the Indian solution to the unevenness of the monsoon. The construction of large dams dominated public expenditure in India after independence. Dams transformed the landscape and altered the water cycle with many unintended and unforeseen consequences. This infrastructural legacy perpetuates deeply-rooted ways of thinking about water, rainfall, and risk: emphasizing large-scale hydraulic engineering above all other approaches to mitigation. These continue to shape Indian responses to climate change. But despite extensive expenditure and despite their public prominence, dams have played a dwindling role in meeting India's irrigation needs since the 1970s. Facilitated by large power subsidies, India's farmers have turned to groundwater irrigation, producing what one expert has described as Ban atomistically managed water-scavenging irrigation regime involving tens of millions of pump owners"" (Shah 2009). Many parts of South Asia have already crossed critical thresholds of freshwater availability, proposed by Rockstrom et al.

This article examines how a series of interventions in a particular dryland area in southern Kenya became embroiled in a long-running territorial conflict between the Loita Maasai (the beneficiary community) and their neighbours, the non-beneficiary Purko Maasai. Based on ethnographic research and by taking a historical perspective, it shows how Loita Maasai leaders systematically appropriated these outside interventions, used and reworked them with the strategic aim of stopping land loss to ongoing Purko encroachment. The analysis reveals two ways in which Loita leaders realized this: (a) by using interventions to stake out spatial claims to land; and (b) by capitalizing on the tendency of interventions to simplify local contexts. This article contributes to the debate on the linkages between intervention and conflict by highlighting the agency of intervention beneficiaries and showing that, through their actions, interventions may unwittingly reproduce and even aggravate existing conflicts.",2018.0,MDPI,Science & Technology - Other Topics,"Territorial Conflicts, Agency and the Strategic Appropriation of Interventions in Kenya's Southern Drylands",Interdisciplinary,Angela Kronenburg,Angela,1.0,1.0

Understanding the ability of households in these countries to adapt to climate change is critical in order to determine the magnitude of the potential damages. In this paper, I investigate the ability of farmers in India to adapt to higher temperatures. I use a methodology that exploits short-term weather fluctuations as well as spatial variation in long-run climate. Specifically, I estimate how damaging high temperatures are for districts that experience high temperatures more or less frequently. I find that the losses from high temperatures are lower in heat-prone districts, a result that is consistent with adaptation. However, while adaptation appears to be modestly effective for moderate levels of heat, my results suggest that adaptation to extreme heat is much more difficult. Extremely high temperatures do grave damage to crops, even in places that experience these temperature extremes regularly. The persistence of negative impacts of high temperatures, even in areas that experience high temperatures frequently, underscores the need for development policies that emphasize risk mitigation and explicitly account for climate change-related risks.

Water management strategies are becoming especially important. In the past, societies had to adapt in order to survive as well. Communities often practised long-term sustainable agriculture. By understanding the ways in which ancient communities were successful at or failed in attaining social-ecological resilience through water management archeologists can provide important information for modern communities facing similar problems. Archeology's long time perspective is very valuable. However, archeologists are confronted with a number of issues. Archeology can only study the material remains of past societies, not the living communities. Not all human activity translates into material residue and not all materials survive. Moreover, people will not demonstrate completely rational cause-and-effect behavior, but ideology and beliefs, which archeology can only poorly attest, will also have influenced decisions. Nevertheless, archeology can bring a unique perspective to the debate on climate change adaptation: archeology can falsify or corroborate sustainability claims, ancient water management techniques may still be a resilient mode of subsistence and ancient techniques often rely on relatively simple technology allowing for easier adoption. When transposing ancient water management techniques to modern situations it is important to involve stakeholders from an early stage, to incorporate traditional knowledge systems as much as possible and most importantly to ascertain whether physical and socio-cultural circumstances are comparable. Archeological knowledge on ancient sustainability and water management is not a panacea for all climate related aridification, but can contribute a unique longue duree perspective.

Ocean temperatures are rising which triggers massive changes in water chemistry and thereby alters the living environment of all marine organisms. Studying adaptation, however, can be tricky because spatial genetic patterns might also occur due to random effects, for example, genetic drift. Genetic drift is reduced in very large and well-connected populations, such as in broadcast marine spawning organisms. Here, spatial genetic divergence is likely to be produced by selection. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) investigated patterns of spatial genetic divergence and their association with environmental factors in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). This commercially important species of mollusc is a broadcast spawner with large population sizes, rendering genetic drift an unlikely factor in the genetic divergence of wild populations. Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) used a ddRAD genomic approach to test for genetic divergence between sampled populations while also measuring different environmental factors, for example, water temperature and oxygen content. The majority of identified SNPs was putatively neutral and showed only low levels of genetic divergence between field sites. However, 323 candidate adaptive markers were identified that clearly separated the individuals into five different clusters. These genetic clusters correlated with environmental clusters mainly determined by water temperature and (correlated) oxygen concentration. Gene annotation of the candidate SNPs revealed a large proportion of loci being involved in biological processes influenced by oxygen availability. The study by Sandoval-Castillo etal. (2018) in this issue of Molecular Ecology exemplifies the benefits of combining genomic studies with ecological data. It is a great starting point for more detailed (gene function, physiology) as well as broader (biodiversity) investigations that might help us to better understand adaptation and predict ecosystems' resilience and resistance to environmental disturbances. In addition, this information can be applied to implement optimal conservation regime policies and sustainable harvesting strategies, hopefully protecting biodiversity as well as commercial interests in marine life.",2018.0,WILEY,Biochemistry & Molecular Biology,Oxygen concentration drives local adaptation in the greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata),Biology,Kathrin P.,Kathrin,1.0,1.0

Critical temperatures for each stage were obtained from the literature and used to identify the occurrence freeze injury based on minimum temperature occurrence. In New York, temperature variance was the dominant climatological factor controlling freeze risk. A small <5% increase in variance counteracted mean temperature increases of up to 5.5 degrees C leading to increased freeze risk despite warming temperatures. In other apple-growing regions in the northwestern and southeastern United States, changes in freeze risk were dominated by changes in mean temperature. This demonstrates that in some regions the risk of freeze injury under future climate conditions may be more sensitive to changes in temperature variance. Variance is currently not well simulated by climate models. Because freeze risk also increases when the chill requirement is reduced, adaptation decisions to transition to lower chill requirement cultivars may be ill-advised in northern climates similar to New York as even the highest chill requirements were satisfied under the conditions with the greatest warming.

In the first place, to answer the question, whether there is an ecological crisis - not a rhetorical question, given the relative success of denialist attempts to discredit affirmative claims in this regard - a succinct account of the state of natural ecological systems on planet Earth is provided, with reference to evidence to this effect in the freely accessible, growing scientific and critical literature. This literature includes the fifth (and most recent) report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has confirmed the high probability (the highest possible scientific affirmation) that anthropogenic climate change has been happening for some time, and has already harmed planetary ecologies, including human ones. Further (critical) affirmation of the ecological crisis in the work of leading thinkers is adduced and discussed, including that of Joel Kovel, Naomi Klein, John Bellamy Foster and Thomas Princen, with a view to demonstrating the seriousness of the global situation by highlighting the extent to which ""natural"" states of affairs - regarding Earth processes such as global warming, ocean acidification, species extinction and chemical pollution - are approaching ""red alert"" status. Despite this scientifically demonstrable fact, neoconservative capitalist forces continue promoting a denialist agenda, while simultaneously (and contradictorily) - as Klein shows persuasively - preparing for ""extreme climate events"" with a view to making a profit out of them at several levels, including those of insurance and para-military intervention for restoring social order. Secondly, the causal relationship between the scientifically confirmed state of planetary ecosystems and the economic system and practices of neoliberal (consumer) capitalism is addressed, specifically in the light of the principle, that unbridled economic growth is not possible within a finite, but encompassing, ecological system, the former being only a part of the latter. Hence the demonstrable deleterious effects of unregulated economic growth on ecosystems, as perceptible in the Earth processes referred to. The consequences of this type of growth for living beings are highlighted, and some of the economic drivers of ecological degradation are identified. These include the increase in fuel-guzzling motor cars and in air traffic, coal-production, natural gas-production, and the decimation of oxygenproducing trees. The character of capitalism and of capital - the widely misunderstood process at its core - is articulated, pointing out that capital is subject to the iron law of ""grow or die"". The link between the character of capitalism and the people who are its agents is explored, and an analogy between the ""symbiotic"" functioning of capital in society, on the one hand, and the symbiotic relationship between mitochondria and the human body, on the other hand, is utilised to illuminate the fact that capital, while retaining its own characteristics, nevertheless flourishes in society because, without its human agents, it cannot grow. In the third place, to be able to grasp the grounds of the looming ecological crisis more adequaletly, the focus shifts to the technophiliac, or techno-optimistic nature of contemporary society, by drawing on the work of (mainly) Martin Heidegger, Sherry Turkle, Bernard Stiegler and Gil Germain. Although Heidegger issued an early warning against a collective mindset that approached all problems within a technocratic framework, it is clear that the world has since become decisively technocratic, and that the widespread use of electronic technical devices reflects a pervasive technophilia. Turkle has shown that this has gone as far as people showing a remarkable (and to her alarming) tendency, of preferring the imagined simplicity of ""relationships"" with robotic beings to the complexity of human relationships. Moreover, there are clear signs, according to her, of the deterioration of children's ability to socialise with their peers, which she attributes to the interposition of technical gadgets such as smartphones between one child or person and another. Stiegler, in turn, argues that the transfer of natural human capacities such as memory to what he calls mnemo-technical devices, not only leads to the deterioration of such human capacities, but that the cynical use of these devices by capitalist agencies for marketing products and increasing purchasing capacity ultimately robs people of their ""savoir-faire"" (know-how) and even worse, of their ""savoir-vivre"" (the knowledge of how to live a fulfilling life). In Germain's work we encounter a telling analysis of the difference between a society (such as that of Plato in ancient Greece), where a clear awareness of the essence of beinghuman was demonstrated, namely, that humans are ""erotic beings"", or beings of desire who live in a world of openness and unpredictable possibility, on the one hand, and contemporary society, which is increasingly predicated on the supposed ability to satisfy all human needs technologically on the other. Such vaunted technical control, Germain argues, undermines being-human because it relegates desire to mere need, and concomitantly replaces a world of openness with one that is closed. Small wonder, then, that there is such abundant evidence of techno-optimism; after all, if everything can be technically controlled, surely - so the argument goes - technical solutions to the emerging ecological crisis must be possible. In conclusion the emergence of a new philosophical genre, namely, ""extinction studies"" is briefly discussed in relation to the philosophical question, how it is possible for supposedly ""rational"" human beings to display a preference of sorts for the perpetuation of an eco-destructive economic system (capitalism), compared to the survival of (human) life on Earth.",2018.0,"SUID-AFRIKAANSE AKAD VIR WETENSKAP EN KUNS, SEKRETARIS",Social Issues,"The ecological crisis, capitalist economy and techno-optimism",Sociology,Bert,Bert,0.0,0.0

The vegetation dynamics allows a better understanding of man-environment relationships in this important cultural period. During Epipaleolithic times, hunter-gatherer groups lived at first in an open landscape (phase 1a) and later in a pre-forest environment (phase 1b). During the Late Mesolithic, an enlarged spectrum of angiosperms follows a climatic optimum and emphasizes the progressive evolution towards a more closed vegetal habitat (phase 2). This propitious context favours the beginning of the Neolithic. A most trenchant observation is made at Margineda: ecological changes precede cultural changes.

Effective planning for development of these lake beds requires a knowledge of the lake-level fluctuations that should be anticipated and also the effect of wind, earthquakes, and human activity on flooding.  The historic record of fluctuations of the closed-basin lakes of the Great Basin of the western United States is too short to adequately define the recurrence intervals of high lake levels.  Geomorphic evidence can supplement the historic record.  Great Salt Lake is the largest closed-basin lake in the Great Basin and its lake bed has been the most extensively developed.

The resulting flooding caused extensive damage to developments on the lake bed and posed serious dilemmas to Federal, state and local governments.  Studies subsequent to the flooding reveal how geomorphic evidence can supplement the historic record and provide sufficient understanding of the lake's flooding hazard to guide development and planning.  Under the climatic conditions that have existed for the past several thousand years, the still-water level of Great Salt Lake can be expected to rise to near the historic highstand, or slightly above, about once every one hundred years.

Immunologic and epidemiologic observations of several conditions suggest that activation of T cells formed in early life mediate injury to the central nervous system. Early in life, selection of lymphocytes by the thymus produces a weakly autoreactive T cell repertoire which, with the help of transient maternally-derived defenses, recognizes pathogens. These responses later are supplemented by pathogen-specific responses, acquired as microbes are encountered. As the thymus involutes, the diversity of pathogen-specific responses to microbial epitopes is progressively fixed. Reduced and delayed pathogen exposure, common in developed societies, limits the repertoire of memory T cells, which can efficiently eliminate pathogens. Due to their small number, pathogen-specific lymphocytes which mature extrathymically may not be able to rapidly eliminate most pathogens, and without the editing of the thymus, they may be autoreactive. In this setting, novel pathogens with epitopes mimicking myelin may elicit a T cell response which is autoreactive. Peptides of common microbes are known to activate T cells recognizing dominant antigens of myelin. It is postulated that at the equator, intense, non-seasonal encounters with microbes elicit an immune repertoire that produces resistance to autoimmunity, while, in temperate climates, moderate, seasonal exposures increase susceptibility to it. The differences in responses to microbes between populations with a low or high prevalence of multiple sclerosis suggests that T cell repertoires are divergent in these groups. An exuberant innate response, postulated to diminish as the load of enteric microbes falls and sanitation improves in relation to the distance from the equator, may increase resistence to multiple sclerosis by eliminating the need for T cell activation. Human herpesvirus-6 and respiratory syncytial virus are possible prototypes of microbes which activate myelin-directed T cells.

The higher the temperature, the shorter the observed length of the pre-reproductive period, ranging from 6 days at 28 degrees C up to 24 days at 10 degrees C. The reproductive period also became shorter with the increase in temperature. A. craccivora female fecundity was dependent on temperature. The highest recorded rate of fecundity was observed when the temperature was 20 degrees C (on average 115 larvae/female). The developmental threshold was calculated to be 3.3 degrees C. The intrinsic rate (r(m)) was maximal (0.42) at 28 degrees C and minimal (0.07) at 10 degrees C. With increasing temperature there is a finite rate of increase, and the mean rate of generation development shortens. The research suggests that the best range of temperatures for the development of A. craccivora on R. pseudoacacia is between 20-28 degrees C. Therefore, in the future, with climate warming, Aphis craccivora may become more problematic.",2017.0,CRA-RESEARCH CENTRE AGROBIOLOGY & PEDOLOGY,Zoology,EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF APHIS CRACCIVORA (HEMIPTERA APHIDIDAE) ON ROBINIA PSEUDOACACIA,Biology,Beata,Beata,1.0,1.0

Cancer mortality, however, was not seasonal. Mortality seasonality only existed in age groups 45-64 and greater than or equal to 65, For the impact of weather on mortality, no significant relationship between weather variables and cancer mortality was observed. A significant negative association between minimum temperature and a positive relationship between cloud and deaths were found. This suggests that colder and cloudy conditions may heighten mortality. Wind was discovered to have a negative association with mortality. This finding revealed that the stressful effect of wind on mortality was negligible. There was no apparent sex difference.

Marine mammals and many other marine animals rely on sound for short- and long-range communication, for orientation, and for locating prey. This reliance has raised concern that elevated sound levels from human sources may interfere with the behavior and physiology of marine animals. The dominant source of human sound in the sea stems from propulsion of ships. Shipping noise centers in the 20- to 200-14z band. Frequencies this low propagate efficiently in the sea, and shipping has elevated the global deepwater ambient noise 10- to 100-fold in this frequency band. Baleen whales use the same frequency band for some of their communication signals, and concern has been raised that elevated ambient noise may reduce the range over which they can communicate. Marine mammals have a variety of mechanisms to compensate for increased noise, but little is known about the maximum range at which they may need to communicate. Some of the most intense human sources of sound include air guns used for seismic exploration and sonar for military and commercial use. Human sources of sound in the ocean can disturb marine mammals, evoking behavioral responses that can productively be viewed as similar to predation risk, and they can trigger allostatic physiological responses to adapt to the stressor. Marine mammals have been shown to avoid some human sound sources at ranges of kilometers, raising concern about displacement from important habitats. There are few studies to guide predictions of when such changes start to lower the fitness of individuals or have negative consequences for the population.

The English Channel, an epi-continental shallow sea with very strong tides, runs along 650 km of the French coast and 1100 km of the English coast. It is also a bio-geographical crossroad encompassing a much wider range of ecological conditions than other European seas. France's Atlantic coast north of the Gironde estuary is a succession of rocky and sandy shorelines, including a sizeable intertidal zone, a wide continental shelf, and two major estuaries (Loire and Gironde). South of the Gironde, the 260 km of coastline is low, sandy and straight, with a narrowing continental shelf further on South due to the presence of the Cape Breton canyon in the bathyal and abyssal zones. Interface between the continental and oceanic systems, these bordering seas - North Sea, English Channel and Atlantic Ocean - have been the subject of many recent research programmes (the European Mast-FLUX-MANCHE and INTERREG programmes; the national coastal environment programme and the LITEAU programme in France), designed to improve comprehension of the functions, production, and dynamics of these seas as well as their future evolution. Given the many conflicting practices in these littoral zones, integrated coastal zone management appears to be essential in order to cope with both natural phenomena, such as the infilling of estuarine zones, cliff erosion, and rising sea levels, and chronic anthropogenic pressures, such as new harbour installations (container dikes, marinas), sea aggregate extraction for human constructions, and offshore wind mill farms.

Millions of hectares are burned out every year in various countries in all continents. Most of them are burned by the villagers to increase the areas which are available to cultivation but many fires also start by natural causes. Especially in the Mediterranean regions the demise of the traditional landscape management practices along the last decades is another relevant cause of wild fires, since large amounts of fuels are accumulated in the forests, increasing the risk of forest fires. The continuous drought, the rarity of precipitation and the intensity of the winds play a significant role in the onset and evolution of a wild fire. In this work we are trying to link synoptic weather types with events of forest fires that took place in Greece during the 20-year period 1985-2004. To find possible associations with the weather systems prevailing in an area we used the synoptic classification proposed by the ESF's COST 733 action-release 1.2 and the classification software v.17-01. Since the onset of a wild fire is a rather complex phenomenon and is largely determined by the combination of high air temperatures and absence (or rareness) of precipitation during a certain period before the event, we used the sequential option of the classifications. Specifically we applied 3, 7 and 15 days sequences, for 9 and 18 classes, and for KMEANS, DKMEANS, KHC, LUND, HCl and SANDRAS synoptic catalogues in Domain 10 of the COST 733 scheme, in which Greece is located. The analysis shows that if we use KMEANS and HCl for both the 9 and 18 classes and for all sequences the number of synoptic types that are associated with wild fires is reduced to 2-3. These 2-3 categories are associated with almost 70-90% of the total wild fires events in Greece. On the other hand the KHC and LUND catalogues are not very successful since wild fire events are almost evenly dispersed among the categories. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The influence of this mystery lingers in some tenets that govern groundwater law. With the birth of modern geology during the late nineteenth century, groundwater science became recognized in its own right. Over the past two centuries, groundwater has lost its shroud of mystery, and its scientific understanding has gradually grown hand-in-hand with its development for human use. Groundwater is a component of the hydrological cycle, vital for human sustenance. Its annual renewability from precipitation is limited, and its chemical quality is vulnerable to degradation by human action. In many parts of the world, groundwater extraction is known to greatly exceed its renewability. Consequently, its rational management to benefit present and future generations is a matter of deep concern for many nations. Groundwater management is a challenging venture, requiring an integration of scientific knowledge with communal will to adapt to constraints of a finite common resource. As scientists and policy makers grapple with the tasks of groundwater management, it is instructive to reflect on the evolution of groundwater knowledge from its initial phase of demystification at the beginning of the nineteenth century, through successive phases of technological conquest, scientific integration, discovery of unintended consequences and the present recognition of an imperative for judicious management.

Much of this difficulty is rooted in the historical use of craniometric data to justify essentialist typological racial classification schemes. In the post-war era of the 'New Physical Anthropology' (sensu Washburn, 1951), anthropologists began to analyse human variation in an explicitly populationist and evolutionary philosophical and analytical framework. However, even within recent decades, substantially different approaches have been employed; some advocate a focus on the analysis of individual traits or clines, while others are explicitly adaptationist, with a focus on natural selection as the preeminent force of phenotypic diversification. In recent years, a series of studies have analysed craniometric data in an explicitly quantitative genetic framework, which emphasises the importance of neutral forces such as migration, gene flow and genetic drift in creating global patterns of phenotypic diversity. This approach has revealed that global patterns of cranial variation can largely be explained on the basis of neutral theory. Therefore, human cranial data can be productively employed as a proxy for neutral genetic data in archaeological contexts. Moreover, there is a growing recognition that regions of the cranium differ in the extent to which they fit a neutral model of microevolutionary expectation, allowing for a more detailed assessment of patterns of adaptation and phenotypic plasticity within the human skull. Taking an historical perspective, the current state of knowledge regarding patterns of cranial adaptation in response to climatic and dietary effects is reviewed. Further insights will be gained by better incorporating the study of cranial and postcranial variation, as well as understanding the impact of neutral versus non-neutral evolution in creating amongspecies diversity patterns in primates more generally. However, this will most effectively be achieved when comparative anatomy studies are situated within an explicitly quantitative genetic evolutionary framework.",2014.0,IST ITALIANO ANTROPOLOGIA,Anthropology,"Evolutionary insights into global patterns of human cranial diversity: population history, climatic and dietary effects",Anthropology,Noreen,Noreen,1.0,1.0

The purpose of this study is to unravel the characteristics of coastal change on atoll islands of the Gilbert Island chain of the equatorial Pacific nation of Kiribati, especially as they relate to autogenic shoreline processes and El Nino/Southern Oscillation variability. Integration of field observations, differential global positioning system data, historical aerial photographs and ultra-high resolution remote sensing images demonstrates the nature, spatial patterns and rates of change from 17 islands on Maiana and Aranuka atolls. The results illustrate that, between 2005 and 2009, ca 50% of the shorelines on these islands displayed a discernable shift in position; some shorelines were accretionary (at net rates up to ca 8 m year(-1)) and others were erosional (up to ca 18 m year(-1)). Long-term net rates of change on Maiana between 1969 and 2009 were lower than short-term net rates measured between 2005 and 2009. Both short-term and long-term observations illustrate some of the greatest change occur near terminations of the largest, north-south oriented islands, associated with longshore movement of coarse sand and gravel. Direct hits by tropical depressions and marked seasonality, factors interpreted as being essential in island growth and shoreline dynamics elsewhere, do not directly impact these equatorial atolls and can be eliminated as fundamental controls on shoreline dynamics. Similarly, observations over four years suggested that shoreline variability probably is not influenced directly by marked sea-level change, although a recent increase in the rates of shoreline change could reflect instability related to the cumulative effect of a long-term increase in the rate of sea-level rise. Within this framework of global change, local anthropogenic effects, autogenic shoreline processes and El Nino/Southern Oscillation-influenced wind and wave variability control many aspects of these dynamic shorelines.

Environments of stable salinity are inhabited by stenohaline fishes having narrow salinity tolerance ranges. Environments of variable salinity are inhabited by euryhaline fishes having wide salinity tolerance ranges. Euryhaline fishes harbor mechanisms that control dynamic changes in osmoregulatory strategy from active salt absorption to salt secretion and from water excretion to water retention. These mechanisms of dynamic control of osmoregulatory strategy include the ability to perceive changes in environmental salinity that perturb body water and salt homeostasis (osmosensing), signaling networks that encode information about the direction and magnitude of salinity change, and epithelial transport and permeability effectors. These mechanisms of euryhalinity likely arose by mosaic evolution involving ancestral and derived protein functions. Most proteins necessary for euryhalinity are also critical for other biological functions and are preserved even in stenohaline fish. Only a few proteins have evolved functions specific to euryhaline fish and they may vary in different fish taxa because of multiple independent phylogenetic origins of euryhalinity in fish. Moreover, proteins involved in combinatorial osmosensing are likely interchangeable. Most euryhaline fishes have an upper salinity tolerance limit of approximately 2x seawater (60 g kg(-1)). However, some species tolerate up to 130 g kg(-1) salinity and they may be able to do so by switching their adaptive strategy when the salinity exceeds 60 g kg(-1). The superior salinity stress tolerance of euryhaline fishes represents an evolutionary advantage favoring their expansion and adaptive radiation in a climate of rapidly changing and pulsatory fluctuating salinity. Because such a climate scenario has been predicted, it is intriguing to mechanistically understand euryhalinity and how this complex physiological phenotype evolves under high selection pressure.",2015.0,COMPANY OF BIOLOGISTS LTD,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Physiological mechanisms used by fish to cope with salinity stress,Biology,Dietmar,Dietmar,0.0,0.0

GW bodies playing the role of accumulating reservoirs regulate the GW discharge enabling the river flow to have more uniform long-term distribution. Along with other important advantages, the GW offers the users stable water abstraction rate independent from the recharge rate. The GW recharge quantification belongs to the uneasy tasks in the water resource management. Applying the conventional methods needs multiyear observation records of the variation of the groundwater body (GWB) characteristics. The employment of hydrology models avoids that necessity but requires great amount of data related to the soil hydraulic properties, the land topography and cover of the GWB watershed and long-term records of the climatic effects.

It is a complex and advanced model with adequate interpretation of the water-related processes in the soil and on the land surface under atmospheric effects. The input is available from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis atmosphere data and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) data base. The model is applied to GW recharge assessment of the Bulgarian Danube district for the year 2013. The obtained monthly and yearly total district values and the areal distribution of the infiltration intensity are matched to the existing field observation-based estimates.

Climate risk indicators such as seasonal Coefficient of Variation in Precipitation (CVP) and Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) are matched with major eco-systems. Adoption decisions of the six natural resource enterprises are modelled using a spatial Logit model. First, this paper finds that climate risks are higher in the grasslands and meadow eco-systems in South America as they are high in the lowland arid zones in Africa. However, climate risks across the continent are, compared with Sub-Saharan Africa, much lower in South America. Second, a higher temperature implies a higher climate risk in Africa, which is not the case in South America owing to the predominant influences of regional weather events such as the ENSO. Third, while the CVP is a dominant risk factor in Africa, the DTR is a dominant risk factor in South America due to the vast ranges of the Andes Mountain. Winter DTR is predicted to fall by 3 degrees C under both the UKMO and the GISS scenarios by the middle of this century. Altered climate risks will push a large number of farmers to switch away from a crops-only enterprise due to a large decrease in daily temperature variability.

Major problems constraining the efficiency with which rainfall is used are: large portions of this water run off or are evaporated from soil surfaces; root zone water holding capacity is not sufficient to hold water needed to sustain good crop production; and the random nature of the precipitation and associated probabilities of crop failure deter investments needed to achieve improved efficiency of water use on high value crops in rain fed lands. Gravel and organic mulches have shown potential for reducing annual evaporation to as low as 10 cm of water and for facilitating entry of expected intensities of rainfall. Under such mulches, soil water is almost as dependable as ''money in the bank'', and can be retained for use in seasons when high value crops are most efficiently grown. Measurements of such stored water plus past weather records can provide bases for calculating probabilities of adequate water being available for crops whose water requirements are known. Most of these water requirements have been determined when these crops were planted close together and root zones, and in some cases the crop canopy, overlapped. Research is needed to determine the degree to which wider spacing of high value vegetables and fruit crops under mulched conditions can be used to increase probabilities of economic production when water supplies are marginal. For tree crops, where planting density is not temporally flexible, but small amounts of irrigation water may be available at high cost, management systems are needed to optimize use of rain and ascertain when the economic benefits are sufficiently great to justify use of the irrigation water. Such sporadic use requires that the supply system can provide water on demand. Increases in rooting depths by modifying soils with restricting layers can serve as a cost effective alternative to irrigation under some climatic regimes. Such regimes should be identified and costs of increasing rooting depths should be evaluated and reduced where possible. Availability of municipal and industrial waste products, whose producers may be willing to pay costs of transport and incorporation, may provide economically feasible means of removing such restrictions.

In addition, the results suggest that the jays increased their energy reserves later in the day, and that they facultatively increased their reserves in response to lower temperatures, heavier snowfall, and windier conditions. These results indicate that there was a seasonal increase in energy reserves associated with decreasing photoperiod, and that superimposed on this pattern was a daily cycle sensitive to contemporaneous climatic conditions.

535,"GARRATT, JR",[''],1.0,"Aspects of the land-surface and boundary-layer treatments in some 20 or so atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) are summarized. In only a small fraction of these have significant sensitivity studies been carried out and published. Predominantly, the sensitivity studies focus upon the parameterization of land-surface processes and specification of land-surface properties-the most important of these include albedo, roughness length, soil moisture status, and vegetation density. The impacts of surface albedo and soil moisture upon the climate simulated in GCMs with bare-soil land surfaces are well known. Continental evaporation and precipitation tend to decrease with increased albedo and decreased soil moisture availability. For example, results from numerous studies give an average decrease in continental precipitation of 1 mm day-1 in response to an average albedo increase of 0. 13. Few conclusive studies have been carried out on the impact of a gross roughness-length change-the primary study included an important statistical assessment of the impact upon the mean July climate around the globe of a decreased continental roughness (by three orders of magnitude). For example, such a decrease reduced the precipitation over Amazonia by 1 to 2 mm day-1. The inclusion of a canopy scheme in a GCM ensures the combined impacts of roughness (canopies tend to be rougher than bare soil), albedo (canopies tend to be less reflective than bare soil), and soil-moisture availability (canopies prevent the near-surface soil region from drying out and can access the deep soil moisture) upon the simulated climate. The most revealing studies to date involve the regional impact of Amazonian deforestation. The results of four such studies show that replacing tropical forest with a degraded pasture results in decreased evaporation (almost-equal-to 1 mm day -1) and precipitation ( 1-2 mm day -1), and increased near-surface air temperatures (almost-equal-to 2 K). Sensitivity studies as a whole suggest the need for a realistic surface representation in general circulation models of the atmosphere. It is not yet clear how detailed this representation needs to be, but even allowing for the importance of surface processes, the parameterization of boundary-layer and convective clouds probably represents a greater challenge to improved climate simulations. This is illustrated in the case of surface net radiation for Amazonia, which is not well simulated and tends to be overestimated, leading to evaporation rates that are too large. Underestimates in cloudiness. cloud albedo, and clear-sky shortwave absorption, rather than in surface albedo, appear to be the main culprits. There are three major tasks that confront the researcher so far as the development and validation of atmospheric boundary-layer (ABL) and surface schemes in GCMs are concerned: (i) There is a need to assess critically the impact of ''improved'' parameterization schemes on GCM simulations, taking into account the problem of natural variability and hence the statistical significance of the induced changes. (ii) There is a need to compare GCM simulations of surface and ABL behavior (particularly regarding the diurnal cycle of surface fluxes, air temperature, and ABL depth) with observations over a range of surface types (vegetation, desert, ocean). In this context, area-average values of surface fluxes will be required to calibrate directly the ABL/land-surface scheme in the GCM. (iii) There is a need for intercomparisons of ABL and land-surface schemes used in GCMs, both for one-dimensional stand-alone models and for GCMs that incorporate the respective schemes.",1993.0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,SENSITIVITY OF CLIMATE SIMULATIONS TO LAND-SURFACE AND ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER TREATMENTS - A REVIEW,Earth sciences,JR,JR,,

Tide-dominated sedimentary processes are complicated by the strong monsoonal climate, and associated seasonal wave activity and precipitation-induced discharge. Different exposure to wave activity leads to contrasting sedimentary processes, sedimentation and morphologic response among various types of tidal flats. Summertime heavy rainfalls accentuate runoff discharge-driven sedimentation in the tidal flats, irrespective of the presence of rivers. Tidal flats have been venue for government-driven mega reclamation projects such as Saemankeum, Sihwa, and Youngjong Yongyou islands due to their geographic proximity to urban area and flat morphology.

An ethical analysis of their proposal is warranted, and one promising approach is the theologically grounded process of making prudent decisions like those that Thomas Aquinas outlined and explained in the thirteenth century. Following his detailed method of discovering the facts, identifying a justifiable course of action, and commanding its implementation, it can be concluded that adding more nuclear capacity to our nation's energy mix is imprudent and will produce intergenerational injustice until the isolation of the spent fuel at existing plants is underway and space is assured for the spent fuel removed from new nuclear reactors.

Within international human rights law, the treaty having the greatest impact is the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR contains guarantees of equality and non-discrimination. Furthermore, its Optional Protocol allows individuals to petition the United Nations Human Rights Committee (Committee) and assert government violations of their rights. Several individuals have petitioned the Committee, asserting that denials of same-sex marriage and partnership benefits at the domestic level violate the ICCPR. In response, the Committee has issued its views on the merits of the complaints. Domestic courts and other stakeholders in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa have increasingly utilized the ""jurisprudence"" of the Committee to support arguments in favor of same-sex marriage. The Committee is sensitive to the climate of prevailing opinion within states. Accordingly, there exists a dialogue between the Committee and State Parties on the same-sex marriage issues. Five factors pertaining to the Committee-State Party dialogue are likely to influence the likelihood of the Committee articulating a marriage equality-protective interpretation of the ICCPR in the future. These factors are: (1) the number of state parties enacting same-sex marriage; (2) the level of ""internal enforcement"" of the Committee's views through incorporation into national judicial decisions; (3) the level of ""external enforcement"" of the Committee's views through bilateral and multilateral diplomacy; (4) the potential costs to the Committee's legitimacy and reputation should it pronounce an ICCPR right to same-sex marriage before states indicate willingness to accept such a right; and (5) the degree to which same-sex marriage recognition remains overwhelmingly confined to Western states.

Therefore, this study examines the risk of port failures from the perspective of vulnerability. Specifically, seven vulnerable factors derived from the extant literature and lessons learned from the previous disaster cases are evaluated using geographic information systems. The results reveal that port capacity and efficiency have a significant effect on port vulnerability in which the efficiency of gantry cranes, labor productivity, free trade zone business volume, and ground access networks play crucial roles in port failure.

Two species in particular, Pomacea canaliculata and Pomacea maculata, have been introduced to several rice-growing regions. Flooded rice systems represent a high-quality habitat for these apple snails because of similarities in the environmental conditions (water temperature, salinity, pH, water flow velocity) necessary for both rice production and for snail survival and development. Furthermore, amphibious respiration, a capacity to aestivate during dry periods, as well as cold acclimation and tolerance (particularly in P. canaliculata), increases the resilience of apple snails to rice farming practices, including agrochemical applications, intermittent drainage and crop rotations - under a wide range of climatic conditions. Risks to regional rice production depend on four principal factors: these are (a) regional climate, (b) regional rice-production systems, (c) prevailing production practices, and (4) the presence/absence of invasive, non-native apple snails. Based on these criteria, lowland irrigated rice in tropical and subtropical regions that is wet-direct seeded is most vulnerable to damage from both native and non-native apple snails (albeit with greater losses from non-native snails because of normally higher densities). Adequate quarantine regulations, particularly in vulnerable tropical regions that are adjacent to centres of recent outbreaks (e.g. India and Bangladesh adjacent to Myanmar, Peru and Colombia adjacent to Ecuador) and attention to the preparedness of farming systems could reduce potential impacts as these highly invasive snails continue to spread. The urgent development of labour-saving crop-establishment methods that reduce dependencies on chemical molluscicides is necessary to achieve sustainable rice production in regions at risk from non-native apple snails.",2018.0,WILEY,Agriculture,The ecophysiology of apple snails in rice: implications for crop management and policy,Agriculture,F.

The hypothesis was that features of criminal justice social work (CJSW) impact on workers' experience of ethical stress, namely the agency's approach to risk, the ethical climate of the agency and the approach to the work with offenders. Results suggest that: the more risk-averse and managerial a workplace is perceived to be, the more ethical stress will be experienced; senior social workers play an important role; and the approach to working with offenders does not seem to have a direct effect on ethical stress. The last finding, and analysis of the comments, demonstrate that respondents were very clear that public protection/risk work takes priority over welfare work.

Kaminaljuyu is based on a catchment-lake relationship, Copan on a downstream impact of a large mountain watershed, and Tikal represents an upland settlement based on a headwater spot. The main aim is to analyse water management of these centres, particularly, in view of their rise and collapse. Selected ancient Maya centres used very sophisticated water management systems with several signs of environmental and social implications. That water technology ensured their economic prosperity and consolidation of the administrative and political power for a long time. The water supply of the Maya settlement faced a serious impact of seasonal rainfall with relatively long dry periods (4-5 months) as well as fast runoff formation in the karstified bedrock. While in the Copan centre, surrounded by a large mountain watershed, the flood control was the highest priority, headwater located Kaminaljuyu and Tikal concentrated mainly on the harvest and storage of rain water. Later, these centres had to adapt to the increasing population, changing society, environment and landuse. For a long time their water management was able to adapt to the increasing demand of water and decreasing recharge of water resources. The exact reason of the collapse of these Maya centres was probably a superposition of the climate change, overexploitation of natural resources, and exceeding the carrying capacity of their environment.

An understanding of how to maintain healthy soil is essential to reverse and prevent land degradation. Organic agriculture is a whole system approach based upon a set of processes resulting in sustainable ecosystems, safe food, good nutrition, animal welfare and social justice. It is more than just a system of production that includes or excludes certain inputs, particularly agro-chemicals, because it builds on and enhances the ecological management skills of farmers, fisher folk and pastoralists. Practicing organic or agro-ecological agriculture requires ecological knowledge, planning and commitment to work with natural systems, rather than trying to change them. IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements) is an organization that promotes such sustainable agricultural systems. The application and upholding of the principles of organic agriculture can help ensure that agriculture can be continued throughout the world while contributing to the prevention and reversal of land degradation, combating poverty and building a fairer world order for all people. In 2004, IFOAM published a scoping study on ""The Role of Organic Agriculture in Mitigating Climate Change"". The study looked at how organic agriculture could contribute to reducing green house gas (GHG) emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Organic agriculture minimizes carbon dioxide emissions from agricultural ecosystems, and can also contribute to carbon sequestration because of the systematic application of manure and compost from animal and crop residues, crop-legume rotations, green manuring with legumes, and agroforestry with multipurpose leguminous trees. Soil is the most important sink for methane where high bacterial activity oxidizes it. Controlled anaerobic digestion of animal manure can contribute significantly to reducing methane emissions. Nitrous oxide emissions are minimized in an organic system. In 1996, the Institute for Sustainable Development started to work with local farming communities and local development agents and experts in Tigray, northern Ethiopia, to rehabilitate their environment and raise crop yields through using compost. Since 1998, ISD has monitored the impact of compost on crop yields in farmers' fields. Overall, compost generally doubles the yield from fields that have not had any input. In most cases it also gives a higher yield than the use of chemical fertilizer. Other benefits from using compost include increased moisture retention capacity of the soil and reduced crop pest problems. The principles behind organic agriculture are also used in programs and projects focused on overcoming food insecurity, rural poverty and environmental degradation. In 2003, IFOAM reported that over 40,000 farms covering 235,000 ha of land were growing certified organic products in Africa.",2007.0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Role of organic agriculture in preventing and reversing land degradation,Environmental studies & forestry,Sue,Sue,1.0,1.0

Emerging countries such as China have the potential to support Africa to achieve the SDGs by pioneering South-South Climate Finance (SSCF) modalities. In order to increase knowledge on climate informed development and the role of China in global climate governance, the paper examined various research articles, case studies, policy briefs and project reports. Sino-African aid, investments and trade were noted as essential in mitigating Africa's climate change vulnerabilities which induce poverty traps and inequality. Some African countries were noted to have a comparative advantage in environmental standards over China but lacked the initiative to use this comparative advantage to enhance the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) and assist China to have a sustainable growth trajectory. The paper concludes that SSCF modalities can enhance climate risk management in Africa if they focus on improving financial inclusion and improving climate finance flows towards climate change adaptation activities in Africa.

These can occur over a range of spatial or temporal scales and with different strengths of coupling. Three case studies are used to demonstrate how interdependencies can significantly alter the nature and magnitude of risk, and, consequently, investment priorities for adaptation. The three examples explore interdependencies that arise from (1) climate loading dependence; (2) mediation of two climate impacts by physical processes operating over large spatial extents; and, (3) multiple risks that are influenced by shared climatic and socio-economic drivers. Drawing upon learning from these case studies, and other work, a framework for the analysis and consideration of interdependencies in climate change risk assessment has been developed.

Climate changes are exacerbating issues within an already vulnerable society. Therefore, a review study on the impact of drought on the rain-fed hill farming system, and the potential adaptation measures, was carried out in the mid-hill region of western Nepal. Both agricultural impacts such as depletion of traditional varieties of crops, crop-specific diseases, low production, lack of water for irrigation; and non-agricultural impacts such as changing rural livelihood patterns, and social conflict due to agriculture and water issues were identified as major impacts. Some of the agricultural adaptation measures viz. the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices, crop diversification, and agroforestry practices seem to have been more effective in the region. At the same time, small-scale structural water harvesting measures, for instance, rainwater harvesting, conservation ponds, and irrigation channels, drip water irrigation, and an early warning system for drought events could also be an advantage in this context. Nonetheless, there are several adaptation barriers including ecological and physical constraints, human and information resource-shortages, and social barriers to adaptation.

The effects of this change, occurring over the last few decades, intensify, and therefore have become an object of interest to governments, the international community, and science. Results of scientific research indicate that the consequences of climate change pose a threat to the social and economic development of many countries worldwide. The current situation in the world would not have been so dramatic if it had not been for the fact that the trend in climate change has already brought about a significant and noticeable effect on numerous physical and biological systems (water, the environment, health). Over the last decades, scientists also noted an increase in the number of natural disasters caused by the climate change. The consequences of climate change and the emergence of extreme weather events always affect the most sensitive areas. According to the National Adaptation Strategy for Poland, sensitive areas include coastal and mountainous zones, agricultural land, areas of high biological diversity, and residential areas. The production carried out in agricultural land is subject to natural weather conditions, which means that agricultural producers, due to the climate change taking place, are at increasing risk contributing to the reduction in the future income because of the occurring financial losses, soil erosion, or a low quality of grazing land, which translates into a reduction in investment in the means of production and the development of modern technologies in the agricultural farm. One of the latest reports Food and Agrieztlture Organization of the United Nations indicates a wide range of adaptation and mitigation measures which an agricultural producer may implement in their farm in order to minimize the consequences of ongoing climate change. The variability of weather in areas used for agriculture has always performed. The study aimed at a deeper understanding of the evolution of hedging activities by the variability of weather and finding the roots of the emergence of adaptive models.

Managed retreat, the purposeful movement of people and infrastructure out of vulnerable floodplains, is one possible adaptation strategy. The USA has already engaged in a limited amount of retreat by providing federal funds to purchase and demolish or relocate vulnerable properties. As retreat programs are expected to expand in size and frequency to address the increased risks posed by climate change, a review of how such property acquisition programs have been implemented is timely. Specifically, decisions made by government officials regarding where to acquire properties have significant potential social justice implications, as buyouts could promote or reduce existing social inequities, but it is unclear how such decisions are being made. A review of eight US buyout programs suggests that buyouts, as practiced, lack transparency, which may increase public distrust of the process and reduce participation. Moreover, decisions often involve political motivations and rely on cost-benefit logic that may promote disproportionate retreat in low-income or minority communities, continuing historic patterns of social inequity. However, as low-income communities in the USA also tend to be highly vulnerable to climate-exacerbated hazards, a decision not to relocate may also promote disproportionate harm. The buyout programs reviewed provide examples of how to mitigate these concerns through increased transparency, emphasis on relocation, explicit focus on social inequality, longer-term and larger-scale holistic approaches, and participatory pre-disaster planning.

The environmental and geological conditions in Taiwan are sensitive and vulnerable to such disasters. Owing to increasing urbanization in Taiwan, floods and climate-related disasters have taken an increasing toll on human lives. As global warming accelerates the rising of sea levels and increasing of the frequency of extreme weather events, disasters will continue to affect socioeconomic development and human conditions. Under such circumstances, researchers and policymakers alike must recognize the importance of providing useful knowledge concerning vulnerability, disaster recovery and resilience. Strategies for reducing vulnerability and climate-related disaster risks and for increasing resilience involve preparedness, mitigation and adaptation. In the last two decades, extreme climate events have caused severe flash floods, debris flows, landslides, and other disasters and have had negative effects of many sectors, including agriculture, infrastructure and health. Since climate change is expected to have a continued impact on socio-economic development, this work develops a vulnerability assessment framework that integrates both biophysical and social vulnerability and supports synthesized vulnerability analyses to identify vulnerable areas in Taiwan. Owing to its geographical, geological and climatic features, Taiwan is susceptible to earthquakes, typhoons, droughts and various induced disasters. Therefore, Taiwan has the urgent task of establishing a framework for assessing vulnerability as a planning and policy tool that can be used to identify not only the regions that require special attention but also hotspots in which efforts should be made to reduce vulnerability and the risk of climate-related disaster. To analyze the biophysical vulnerability of Taiwan, hazards on eight maps from Taiwan's National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) are analyzed.

This is because a key model input-namely the valuation of centennial climate damage-is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far-out-of-sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non-carbon-price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low-cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.

The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4) concluded that even the most stringent mitigation efforts would not avoid further impacts of climate change in the next few decades. This makes adaptation essential, particularly in addressing near-term impacts. Yet mitigation also remains crucial: to rely on adaptation alone would lead to a level of climate change to which it is no longer possible to effectively adapt, or only at very high social, economic and environmental costs. Successful action on climate change therefore must include both mitigation and adaptation. For the last two decades or even more, the literature on climate change, its science, the role of human society, the physical and socio-economic impact has experienced an explosive growth and surge in research and policy analysis on ways in which technology and finance can support mitigation. Similar studies for adaptation are much more recent, and their results therefore less mature. As adaptation is deemed an urgent need, its financing issue is now at the centre of all discussions related to adaptation. Against this background, the major focus of this paper is the financing of adaptation measures in developing countries. Of course, it should be acknowledged that mere financing represents only a part of what is needed in order to adapt to climate change. But to keep the discourse limited to adaptation financing, this paper is organized into the following sections: describing the nature and scale of the adaptation challenge in developing countries, presenting the range of numbers that have been put on the table to estimate the developing countries' actual need for adaptation funding.

Even though the question of what exactly constitutes a successful adaptation to climate change is still unanswered and calls for further research, there is some evidence that many rural and indigenous communities are actively putting into place initiatives to adapt to climate change. But even in today's Internet age it seems difficult to identify these communities properly as information from Africa is fragmented, outdated or simply not to be found. Yet knowing what kind of adaptation is taking place on the local level is a prerequisite for successful approaches to state-of-the-art adaptation which link bottom-up action with top-down strategies.

To reflect the complex nature of adaptation, the identified initiatives were grouped into two categories social and economic resilience and a range of emerging adaptation themes were identified. Comprising 39 local-and regional initiatives, the analysis provides some recent examples of concrete local adaptation that may possess a certain potential for replication, upscaling and mainstreaming.

Munich Re's experts have been researching loss events caused by natural hazards around the globe for 40 years. These losses are documented in the NatCatSERVICE database currently documenting more than 36,000 single events. The analyses of the NatCatSERVICE data clearly show a high interannual variability, in some regions decadal oscillations, and a long term trend to an increase in the number of natural catastrophes around the globe, with ever growing losses. The trend curve indicating the number of loss relevant natural catastrophes worldwide reveals an increase by a factor of about three within the last 35 years. As the rise in the number of natural catastrophes is predominantly attributable to weather-related events like storms and floods, with no relevant increase in geophysical events such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, there is some justification in assuming that changes in the atmosphere, and global warming in particular, play a relevant role. However, the main contribution to the upward trend of the losses caused by natural catastrophes comes from socio-economic/demographic factors such as population growth, ongoing urbanization and increasing values being exposed. Prevention measures, especially flood protection programs, on the other hand have a high potential to even reduce losses while the hazard has increased. Because of such factors influencing the loss trends a clear attribution of at least part of the effects to global warming is very difficult. There is, however, an increasing number of studies, which show significant increases in losses in some regions and for some perils even after they have been normalized to the exposed values today. Looking at trends of extreme weather events and their effects, natural climate variability has to be considered. Short term oscillations such as ENSO as well as decadal oscillations in hurricane (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) or typhoon activity (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) still play a dominant role on the variability of losses caused by weather extremes. As global warming will continue in the coming decades, its contribution to increasing natural catastrophe losses will become more prominent, a projection also given by the 5th assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2014). As long as the risks from weather related disasters stay calculable and the insureds can afford a risk adequate premium there is no danger that such risks become uninsurable. Insurers, however, have to invest more resources into analyses of trends and have to assure that premiums for the risks they cover always reflect a dynamic hazard pattern. There is no sensible way to interfere with natural climate oscillations influencing natural catastrophe losses. Humankind, however, still has the chance to avoid catastrophic increases of losses caused by global warming driven weather extremes by ambitious climate protection and adaptation measures.

The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers, hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project Building Nigeria's Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the Coastal/Rainforest in the south east. The projects include but are not restricted to: increasing food security by introducing improved crop varieties; testing alternative livelihood options such as aquaculture in order to provide a means of income and decrease reliance on dwindling forest resources; providing fuel efficient wood stoves; improving access to water sources to deal with water scarcity; and tree planting for ecosystem rehabilitation.",2011.0,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Building Nigeria's Response to Climate Change: Pilot Projects for Community-Based Adaptation in Nigeria,Environmental studies & forestry,Ellen,Ellen,1.0,1.0

However, it is unclear to understand the evolution process of floods and the variation of flood risk in Shanghai during the past 1,000 years. This paper analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics of flood disaster and evaluated the integrated risk of flood disaster in Shanghai based on the historical flood data from 251 to 2000. The results show that flood disaster in Shanghai was divided into storm surge-induced flood, rainstorm-induced flood and overbank flood. Flood disaster in Shanghai presents rising trend with time and mainly occurs in summer and autumn. Moreover, the flood disaster is dominated by rainstorm-induced flood, especially after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Additionally, flood risk in different areas of Shanghai between the years 251-1949 and 1950-2000 changed significantly. Shanghai urban area, Jinshan District and Chongming County belong to increased flood risk area; Baoshan, Jiading, Qingpu, Songjiang, Fengxian, Pudong and Minhang District belong to decreased flood risk area. The integrated risk of flood disaster in Shanghai has presented spatial disparities evidently at present. Shanghai urban area is most likely to suffer flood disaster; Baoshan, Jiading and Minhang District have medium flood risk rank; and Jinshan, Songjiang, Fengxian, Pudong, Qingpu and Chongming County show low flood risk at present. The combined effect of urbanization, sea-level rise, land subsidence and the poor capacity of flood prevention facilities will give rise to the risk of flood in the next several decades.

While advances have been made in the development of frameworks for adaptation planning and in identifying both real and potential barriers to action, empirical work evaluating urban adaptation planning processes has been relatively piecemeal. Existing assessments of current experience with urban adaptation provide necessarily broad generalizations based on the available peer-reviewed literature. This paper uses a meta-analysis of U.S. cities' current experience with urban adaptation planning drawing from 54 sources that include peer-reviewed literature, government reports, white papers, and reports published by non-governmental organizations. The analysis specifically evaluates the institutional support structures being developed for urban climate change adaptation. The results demonstrate that adaptation planning is driven by a desire to reduce vulnerability and often catalyzes new collaborations and coordination mechanisms in urban governance. As a result, building capacity for urban climate change adaptation planning requires a focus not only on city governments themselves but also on the complex horizontal and vertical networks that have arisen around such efforts. Existing adaptation planning often lacks attention to equity issues, social vulnerability, and the influence of non-climatic factors on vulnerability. Engaging city governments and communities in adaptation planning - whether to initiate or expand such efforts - may require that adaptation planning is framed to capitalize on their motivation to protect assets and reduce vulnerability.

The recognition that many environmental problems are local in nature is a rationale behind including the indigenous communities in addressing this global issue. These communities constitute an insignificant percentage of the global population and their contribution to the greenhouse gas emissions is minimal. A collaboration between these communities and the climate scientists could evolve solutions which go beyond the need to mitigate emissions and development of clean development mechanisms.

This paper assesses the vulnerability of the wine sector to climate change in the context of other stresses via a case study of the Maule Region, Chile. The research used a vulnerability approach, which is based on the empirical documentation of exposures, adaptive strategies and adaptive capacity. Problematic climatic exposures, including spring frosts, wet falls and drought, were identified and placed in the context of other forces important to producers, including market price, currency fluctuations, national and international rules and regulations, and labour availability. Producers' experiences with climate have not warranted the development of an extensive suite of adaptation strategies to manage climate risks. The results indicate that the current strategies may not be effective in the future because they are not suited to anticipated changes in water availability and the temperature regime. Although future climate change may be beneficial and create opportunities, many of the producer-identified climatic exposures are projected to be exacerbated in the future, and the current management systems may not have the capacity to address climate variations beyond the currently experienced regime. This has considerable implications for the sector's viability and economic profitability.

After the separation of land and water rights, water became a tradable commodity. In the past, the value of water was significantly underestimated, which led to irrational ways of using this valuable natural resource. The water tariffs were not related to the marginal values of crops grown by irrigators, which caused unsustainable consumption of water, especially during the drought years. The major aim of the COAG reforms was to enable a proper market value for water and to re-allocate water consumption to more economically valuable crops. In 2004-2005, the total water traded in Australia was 1300 GL with 502 GL of Victoria water traded, i.e. about 10% of overall use. Given the severity of drought conditions throughout Australia in recent years, and the uncertainty of whether this is a permanent climate change, water price and supply is a critical issue for farmers. In their present stage of development, markets offer farmers little information about long-term prices and quantities, and limited opportunity for avoiding disastrous water shortfalls or unaffordable water prices beyond the current season. Even for the current season, the present trading system still leaves farmers facing unhedgable uncertainty concerning water prices and quantities. This uncertainty appears to be increasing. For example, in the Goulburn system, managers aim to provide full allocations for 96 years out of 100. Yet three times in the past decade, in 2002-03, 2006-07 and 2007-08, allocations in Goulburn have been below 100%. In response, with growing concerns over changes in rainfall patterns, there may be a growing bias among irrigators against the production of water-dependent perennial commodities which require secure water allocations. Moreover, the annual values for these prices and quantities are not enough for effective risk management and farmers are keen to have this information with more detailed temporal resolution, on a fortnightly or weekly basis. The analysis of historic records of water prices over 5 irrigation seasons in the Goulburn - Murray system, suggests that jumps are a distinctive feature of the water price series, and to account for these jumps, the jump diffusion modelling approach is appropriate. A Brownian motion plus Compound Poisson process is proposed to model the water price dynamics. The simulation result suggests that the stylised water price dynamics can be reproduced by the model. The concept of integration of a modified computable general equilibrium (CGE) model TERM-H2O, with a weekly/fortnightly stochastic model for water prices is introduced. As the water market is gradually maturing and water continues to be a valuable commodity, some new assets existing on other economic markets can be introduced to the water market. Options are one type of very important assets in the financial market, which allow significant increases in the hedging ability of their users. In addition, options also provide greater price certainty to their users and allow them to manage their financial risks in a more efficient manner. This work discusses and conceptualises the possibility of introducing options into the water market. Some important restrictions for water options are outlined: a) the option trading will be only initiated after a short initial period of water trading has passed; b) options are available only for a specified season; c) weekly pool water prices are not impacted by the actual water allocation, i.e. they are purely stochastic and d) as the water price tends to drop sharply towards the end of a season, the option's maturity date is restricted to much earlier than the seasonal ending date. The model of option pricing for the water market is developed and the potential impacts on the underlying water market and market risks are discussed. Taking into account these restrictions and some classical assumptions from financial mathematics (zero transaction cost, arbitrage opportunities, no storage costs etc.) a model for European options for water was developed. The potential impacts, positive as well as negative, of the introduction of water options to the market are discussed.",2009.0,UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,Computer Science,"Water price dynamics, water derivatives and general equilibrium modelling",Computer sciences,S.,,,

However, reference scenarios and return periods for avalanche hazard management are always computed in the engineering practiced under the assumption of a stationary process. On a more phenomenological point of view, contrary to other phenomena such as tropical storms, snow avalanches are very rarely used as proxy indicators that point out signals of climate change. This study focuses on avalanche occurrences and runout altitudes in France over the last six decades. For both variables, a hierarchical spatio-temporal modelling framework is proposed to quantify the interannual fluctuations possibly resulting from climate change. First, the regional annual component is isolated from the total variability using a nonlinear analysis of variance. Second, the latent structured time trend is distinguished from the random noise with different time series shifting level sub-models. The hierarchical structure obtained takes into account the uncertainty related to the estimation of the annual component for the quantification of the time trend. Bayesian inference is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. Avalanche occurrences are studied in the northern French Alps. No systematic modifications in occurrence regime could be found over the last 60 years. This suggests that climate change has recently had little impact on the avalanching rhythm in France. Significant temporal patterns have though occurred. They consist in complex combination of abrupt changes and pseudo-periodic cycles of approximately 15 years. Avalanche runout altitudes are studied in the whole French territory. A change in runout altitude regime has occurred in France around 1976. Between 1946 and 1976, a decrease of 55 m has affected the mean runout altitude, but the probability of a high magnitude event has remained constant. After the change point, the mean runout altitude has regained its initial state, whereas the probability of a high magnitude avalanche has been divided by two. A retreat of avalanche is therefore engaged in France since nearly 30 years. This especially concerns high magnitude events, since the return period associated with an avalanche reaching its minimal altitude on a mean path has increased from 20 to 40 years over the last 30 years. Avalanche occurrences and runout altitudes are therefore differently influenced by changes in constraining climatic factors, so that the interest of a joint temporal modelling of the two phenomena would be limited. One possible explanation is that dry snow avalanches are progressively replaced by wet snow avalanches because of climate worming, thus keeping constant the number of events, but reducing their magnitude by modifying snow rheology. To confirm this statement, further research is needed to compare and explicitly correlate the obtained annual effects with climatic data such as precipitation and temperature series. This will allow improving our knowledge on climate change in the alpine space and its consequence on avalanche hazard.",2009.0,UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA,Computer Science,Assessing the impact of climate change on snow avalanche activity in France over the last 60 winters using hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal change point models,Computer sciences,N.,,,

More progress was achieved on risk identification, screening and prioritisation compared to risk quantification. This was due to the inherent complexity and interdependence of ecological risks and their interaction with socio-economic drivers as well as a climate change. Robust strategies to manage risk were identified as those that coordinate organisational resources to enhance ecosystem resilience, and to accommodate inevitable change, rather than to meet specific species or habitats targets. The assessment also highlighted subjective and contextual components of risk appraisal including ethical issues regarding the level of human intervention in the natural environment and the proposed outcomes of any intervention. This suggests that goals for risk assessment need to be more clearly explicated and assumptions on tolerable risk declared as a primer for further dialogue on expectations for managed outcomes.

In this article, I use the archaeozoological record from late Pleistocene Iberia to show that humans responded to late glacial climate extremes in ways specific to the macro-bioclimatic regions in which they lived. Nestedness, cluster (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages [UPGMA]), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses suggest that in Mediterranean bioclimates, which were less impacted by glacial extremes, people implemented a general broad-spectrum hunting strategy. In the colder, more climatically extreme ""Euro-Siberian"" region, the data suggest a diversity of hunting adaptations, likely shaped by specifics of local environments. While technological change and increasing global connectivity since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) have moderated the direct impact of climate change on humans, these analyses - and others - suggest that local management rather than global decision-making will be key to human adaptations in environments most strongly affected by modern climate change.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a review work which synthesises lessons from relevant journal articles and other related documents. The literature was retrieved from Google and Google Scholar using search terms such as climate change, climate change and mitigation, climate change and mitigation in Africa, climate change adaptation and mitigation in Africa, climate change vulnerability, climate change impacts, among others. Various combinations of the search terms were also deployed. The journals were subjected to critical review and key lessons synthesised from them and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability presented. Findings - Key lessons were synthesised and reflections on their future implications in relation to climate risks and vulnerability were presented. The evidence seems to suggest that countries in Africa recognise that it is time for them to take action on the impacts of climate change. The key lessons which emerge, going forward, are that climate change adaptation should be mainstreamed into development plans of nations. All efforts should be geared towards sustaining livelihoods of people. Key stakeholders also have a role to play in adaptation. The paper has indicated that although a lot has happened, there are areas that require strengthening and that should be the focus and priority of change and policy makers for the future. Research limitations/implications - The paper is a synthesis and reflection of existing literature and it is possible that some of the dynamics may have changed since the paper was published. Practical implications - The dynamics of climate change adaptation is understood. The approaches to adaptation are also explored.

Current international refugee, environmental, and human rights law does not account for climate change-induced displacement and migration, creating legal gaps in protection. This article explores why these gaps persist and seeks to understand the barriers to a protection framework for climate change migrants. If improved protection is to be achieved, then a typology and assessment of the obstacles such an effort faces is a necessary first step. Accordingly, the analytical focus of this article is on the impediments to protection, including whether and how to define a category of 'climate change migrants', a lack of political will to create new protection obligations or to expand existing legal regimes, and the national security focus that dominates current climate change and migration discourse. Institutional capacity issues, the difficulty of linking climate change directly to migration, the causal complexity of climate change, and the limitations of civil society in its climate change advocacy further hinder protection efforts. To advance protection for those displaced or induced to migrate by the effects of climate change, however, the emphasis cannot remain exclusively on obstacles. Climate change presents an opportunity for local decision makers and the international community to plan for impacts, fulfil human rights obligations, and take action on behalf of those who are and will continue to be harmed by climate change.

Compounding this is the potential for non-stationarity in flood risk due to projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change. That is, under projected global warming the resulting changes to ocean atmospheric circulation patterns are likely to lead to shifts in the location, magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events and the associated flooding. Therefore it is clear that ""stationarity is dead"" and that work is urgently required to: (a) re-evaluate current (or baseline) flood risk estimates to take into account the influences of natural climate variability, (b) develop estimations of future flood risk that take into account both the role of natural climate variability and the projected impacts of anthropogenic climate change, and (c) develop positive adaptation strategies and policy frameworks based on these re-evaluated (and more realistic) flood risk estimates. This study concentrates on the first task (re-evaluation of baseline flood risk estimates) by quantifying inter-annual to multi-decadal variability of flood risk in eastern Australia.

Moreover, for the first time, the law requires obsolete ski lifts to be dismantled when they are no longer in use. Of course, although these measures are only legally theoretical at the moment, they represent important progress and are initially relevant to many ski resorts affected by global warming, especially in low-altitude mountain areas. Many of these are already experiencing a lack of snow, and a new economic model needs to be drawn up. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on a review of French laws having an effect on mountain areas' adaptation to climate change. Findings - This paper presents two innovations included in the new French Mountain Act (law of 28 December 2016). Originality/value - This paper underscores problems emanating from global warming in mountain areas. Some ski resorts are facing a lack of snow. The main issue is to anticipate the fact that many ski lifts, or other structures or buildings created for the snow economy, could become obsolete. Legal tools can provide a solution by forcing administrations or operators to be cautious when making decisions relating to new tourist investments, and to dismantle obsolete ski lifts.",2018.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Social Sciences - Other Topics,Tourism development and adaptation to climate change through legal constraint,Interdisciplinary,Jean-Francois,Jean,0.625,

Citizens and public officials in the flood-prone region answered identical choice-experiment surveys characterized by the negative impacts of floods: property damage, traffic disturbances, and water supply security. By having citizens and public officials respond to identical surveys, it was possible to analyse whether and, if so, how priorities and monetary valuation differed in respect of the different negative effects of floods. The overall finding is that public officials' and citizens' preferences seem to converge, and that both citizens and public officials are willing to pay to reduce flood-related costs. Public officials have similar priorities to citizens, in that security of drinking water provision was given priority over property damage, while traffic disturbances were ranked lowest. In terms of their respective willingness to pay to avoid the negative impact of floods, public officials were willing to pay more than citizens to pay for securing the drinking water supply and for restoring damaged property, though these differences were not substantial. There are, however, some differences in preference between citizens and public officials: the latter preferred not to spend anything to reduce traffic disturbances caused by floods, whilst citizens were willing to do so. These results imply that decisions made within the public sector will not come to differ substantially from citizens' preferences.",2017.0,ELSEVIER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Valuing the reduction of floods: Public officials' versus citizens' preferences,Environmental studies & forestry,Elin,Elin,1.0,1.0

It also examines the prospects for Greek regions with respect to climate adaptation. Design/methodology/approach - Using the regional policy approach as it is generally formulated and applied in the context of the EU cohesion policy, this paper seeks to identify the policy objectives, the funding opportunities and the conditionalities for climate adaptation action. It also examines the above-mentioned elements for Greek regions. Findings - The context of the EU cohesion policy constitutes a necessary but not sufficient condition for developing and implementing successful regional adaptation strategies. The process and content of regional policies are of significant importance in order for this context to be fully exploited. Research limitations/implications - Since this is the first time that climate adaptation at the regional level is directly addressed by cohesion policy, there is not much evidence on this issue, at least for Greek regions. Practical implications - The approach followed in this paper may constitute a useful contribution to the formulation of regional adaptation strategies. This is of particular importance as climate adaptation, together with risk prevention, is one of the key thematic objectives of the EU cohesion policy 2014-2020.

Despite recent technological advances, such as from improved plant breeds (cultiva or varieties) to irrigation systems, which have contributed towards improving the world's staple food production significantly, climate still remains as the key factor in agricultural productivity. Hence, understanding the effects of climate change on various staple food crops has become the utmost priority in many aspects especially, to overcome the threats to the world food security. As a result of this, many institutions concerned over related issues and research communities, in recent years, have turned their focus into modelling the phenomenon at various scales and levels. Contemporary research on modelling the climate change patterns in weather conditions and their effects is summarised. Existing crop forecasting models vary significantly in spatiotemporal scales and levels, the lowest being at the micro (e.g. the field or farm at specific days/weeks), and the highest at macro (e.g. regional / district, at months/years) or global, the crops being studied include, staple crops (maize, rice and wheat) and vineyards all using an array of variables characterised by 1) historic (using a multitude of sources, e.g. metrological, phenological, satellite imagery and wireless sensors at the micro scale, or 2) simulated data (www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html), both against observed yield In this context, the paper presents an initial investigation in which four data mining algorithms are explored to analyse the rice crop data in Sri Lankan administrative divisions, as an example study. Rice is the main staple food for Sri Lankans and paddy cultivation in the country dates back to as early as 800 BC. Presently, paddy is being cultivated as a wetland crop, either rain fed or irrigated.

There was no significant change in rainfall during annual and the bimodal seasons during this period of study. However, there was significant change in the rainfall coefficient of variation. STARDEX precipitation indices provided a measure of intensity, frequency and proportion of total rainfall. Ninetieth percentile of rainfall, number of rainy days with rainfall > 10 mm/day and the greatest 10 d total rainfall were increased over time at most of the stations. Among the major droughts, 1984-'85 drought was reported as the most severe drought with peak negative SPI value -3.68 in Wollo. The longest duration of drought lasted for 63 months in Borena Zone in southern Ethiopia during 1983-2012 period. Extreme maximum temperature (90th percentile) has increased over 45% of the weather stations, while, extreme minimum temperature (90th percentile) has increased 53% of the weather stations.

This review will present the argument that these changes represent a genuine paradigm shift in urban environmental planning. Reflection and action to develop this paradigm shift is critical now and in the next decades, because environmental planning for cities will only become more urgent as we enter a new climate period. The concepts, methods and assumptions that urban environmental planners have relied on in previous decades to protect people, ecosystems and physical structures are inadequate if they do not explicitly account for a rapidly changing regional climate context, specifically from a hydrological and ecological perspective. The over-arching concept of spatial suitability that guided planning in most of the 20th century has already given way to concepts that address sustainability, recognizing the importance of temporality. Quite rapidly, the concept of sustainability has been replaced in many planning contexts by the priority of establishing resilience in the face of extreme disturbance events. Now even this concept of resilience is being incorporated into a novel concept of urban planning as a process of adaptation to permanent, incremental environmental changes. This adaptation concept recognizes the necessity for continued resilience to extreme events, while acknowledging that permanent changes are also occurring as a result of trends that have a clear direction over time, such as rising sea levels. Similarly, the methods of urban environmental planning have relied on statistical data about hydrological and ecological systems that will not adequately describe these systems under a new climate regime. These methods are beginning to be replaced by methods that make use of early warning systems for regime shifts, and process-based quantitative models of regional system behavior that may soon be used to determine acceptable land uses. Finally, the philosophical assumptions that underlie urban environmental planning are changing to address new epistemological, ontological and ethical assumptions that support new methods and goals. The inability to use the past as a guide to the future, new prioritizations of values for adaptation, and renewed efforts to focus on intergenerational justice are provided as examples. In order to represent a genuine paradigm shift, this review argues that changes must begin to be evident across the underlying assumptions, conceptual frameworks, and methods of urban environmental planning, and be attributable to the same root cause.

Sea defences provide essential protection for coastal lowlands against flooding. The risk of land flooding can increase in the future due to the rise of sea level and change of wave conditions caused by climate change. The rise of sea level causes the increase in local significant wave height and the reduction in crest freeboard of existing sea defences. This leads to increasing wave overtopping discharge through the crest of earth sea dykes. In order to reduce the risk of wave overtopping and run-up caused by rising sea level and maintain the present-day allowances for wave overtopping discharge and run-up height, the future necessary increase in crest level of the existing structures is investigated. The influence of local water depth at the seaside slope toe on the increase in crest level is also studied. The time-dependent reliability of earth sea dykes is analysed to give probability of failure associated with wave overtopping with time. As a result of reliability analysis, the probability of failure of the earth sea dykes can be correctly assessed, which can be used for determining effective maintenance policy for the coastal defences. The results for an example earth dyke section show that the necessary increase in crest level is approximately triple of sea level rise to maintain the current allowances if the dyke crest settlement is considered. Overtopping is the important failure mechanism of the existing earth dyke with a significant increase in failure probability with time under future hydraulic conditions associated with climate change.",2015.0,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP,Engineering,Maintenance of earth sea dykes in changing environmental and structural conditions,Engineering & technology,Hua-Peng,Hua,0.375,

A principal way this will occur is through weather index insurance (WII), a type of insurance that pays out according to estimated losses rather than actual ones. In this paper, I examine one WII product that has been for sale in St. Lucia since May 2013, called the Livelihood Protection Policy, which has been discussed as a model WII product for InsuResilience. This article is based on twelve months of fieldwork conducted in St. Lucia, interviewing people involved in the design, implementation, and distribution of LPP, and actual and potential purchasers of LPP. In this article, I argue that LPP's design as a microinsurance product that can be purchased by any St. Lucian no matter their livelihood has made it largely undesirable because it does not fit anyone's needs well. This occurs for two main reasons. First, rather than primarily being used to help low-income St. Lucians adapt to climate change, LPP was used to test out how an abstract index insurance product can be sold without directly subsidizing the premiums of policyholders. Second, by not being designed for particular livelihoods, LPP suffers from not addressing hazards, such as drought, that many St. Lucians are highly exposed to, and from not compensating policyholders at meaningful wind and rainfall thresholds.",2018.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,Geography,One size does not fit all: Universal livelihood insurance in St. Lucia,Geography,Chris,Chris,0.0,0.0

The paper employs a praxeological method of non-ideal theorising, which entails identifying and negotiating the unavoidable tensions and trade-offs associated with different framings of state responsibility in order to find a path forward that maximises the protection of climate refugees within the constraints imposed by political feasibility. It argues that the responsibility of states to support climate refugees through financial and technical assistance should be treated separately from their responsibility to receive them. The former is a differentiated responsibility grounded in the ability to pay principle, or relative capability, while the latter is a common responsibility grounded in the fact that all states have causally contributed to their plight, albeit in varying degrees which cannot be, and need not be, precisely determined. A common state 'responsibility to receive' is linked with a right on the part of climate refugees to choose their host to suit their circumstances, which would provide a form of partial compensation for the injustice and trauma of their loss and damage.

We are now at a state where practitioners must use these tools within broad decision making frameworks to address system risks and the life cycle economics of prescribed solutions. Otherwise, evidence based policy gaps in the prioritization of risk factors and damages will widen and lead to misdirected mitigation efforts. For example, despite statistically significant decreases in regional short duration rainfall intensities in Southern Ontario, extensive resources are devoted to projecting IDF curves under climate change. Thinking fast, as defined by Daniel Kahne-man, through listing recent extreme events to declare new weather reality risks based on heuristic availability biases, has replaced data driven policy and the statistical rigour of thinking slow problem solving. Under this skewed risk perspective, a high profile Ontario commuter train flood was mischaracterized as an unprecedented event despite a <5 y return period and a greater flood weeks before. Recent Ontario urban flood incidents have been attributed to unprecedented weather despite GIS analysis showing more critical hydrologic drivers. Constraints on effective water management are now less likely to be technical but rather scientific (inadequate representation of urban groundwater systems), institutional (arbitrary boundaries between city and watershed agency jurisdictions), economic (unaffordable green infrastructure solutions based on cost-benefit analysis and flat normalized loss trends), or operational.

The effects of rising temperature include soil degradation, loss of productivity of agricultural land, desertification, loss of biodiversity, degradation of ecosystems, reduced fresh-water resources, acidification of the oceans, and the disruption and depletion of stratospheric ozone. All these have an impact on human health, causing non-communicable diseases such as injuries during natural disasters, malnutrition during famine, and increased mortality during heat waves due to complications in chronically ill patients. Direct exposure to natural disasters has also an impact on mental health and, although too complex to be quantified, a link has even been established between climate and civil violence. Over time, climate change can reduce agricultural resources through reduced availability of water, alterations and shrinking arable land, increased pollution, accumulation of toxic substances in the food chain, and creation of habitats suitable to the transmission of human and animal pathogens. People living in low-income countries are particularly vulnerable. Climate change scenarios include a change in distribution of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with weather extreme events. After floods, increased cases of leptospirosis, campylobacter infections and cryptosporidiosis are reported. Global warming affects water heating, rising the transmission of water-borne pathogens. Pathogens transmitted by vectors are particularly sensitive to climate change because they spend a good part of their life cycle in a cold-blooded host invertebrate whose temperature is similar to the environment. A warmer climate presents more favorable conditions for the survival and the completion of the life cycle of the vector, going as far as to speed it up as in the case of mosquitoes. Diseases transmitted by mosquitoes include some of the most widespread worldwide illnesses such as malaria and viral diseases. Tick-borne diseases have increased in the past years in cold regions, because rising temperatures accelerate the cycle of development, the production of eggs, and the density and distribution of the tick population. The areas of presence of ticks and diseases that they can transmit have increased, both in terms of geographical extension than in altitude.

L.","['CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic, Australia.']",1.0,"Geographic information systems (GIS) have been widely used for examining land/water interactions, such as changes in land cover in watersheds that may influence water quantity and quality in neighbouring surface waters. However, GIS has seen limited application in the analysis of stressor/response relationships within individual basins. The Chesapeake Bay estuary represents one of the largest, most productive, and most monitored estuarine systems in the United States and has undergone marked change over the past three centuries in response to anthropogenic activities in the watershed. Since 1984, data collected via the Chesapeake Bay Program's (CBP) basinwide monitoring efforts have provided information on spatial and temporal changes in benthic biodiversity, water quality and temperature, and (to a lesser extent) concentrations of organic and inorganic toxicants in the sediment. The lack of a standardised sampling scheme across these variables, however, results in spatial and temporal inhomogeneities in the data which are a challenge for data analysis. GIS tools were used to circumvent these problems by aggregating and spatially relating different data sets. The Shannon-Weaver (SW) index of biodiversity was used as an indicator of the health of the benthic community. Point observations of June/July/August (JJA) SW values were transformed to a percentile scale, and a spatial interpolation was performed to model benthic health throughout the basin (Figure 1), revealing sizeable areas of benthic impairment (classified as the lower 20(th) percentile for SW). When this same analysis was conducted over three different time periods (1987-91, 1992-96 and 1997-01), the extent of high impact areas decreased substantially, while low impact areas increased. Although significant differences were found in JJA water quality indicators between high and low impact areas (upper 20(th) percentile for SW), water quality could not explain these temporal changes in biodiversity. However, concentrations of sediment toxicants were both spatially and temporally associated with high impact areas. Multiple regression analysis among specific locations in the basin also suggested a significant influence of toxicants on SW values, although water quality variables also explain a significant fraction of observed variance. Finally, a signal of climate change was readily identifiable in Chesapeake Bay temperature data. Although this does not appear to be a major driver at present, projected changes over the 21(st) century suggest climate change as an important emerging driver of environmental change in the estuary.

N.","['CSIRO Marine & Atmospher Res, Aspendale, Vic 3195, Australia.']",1.0,"The main driver for the large research effort devoted to developing and improving seasonal climate prediction models is the fact that El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events (quasi-periodic fluctuations in Indo-Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures and mean sea level pressure) represent, on a global scale, the greatest source of interannual climate variability and are, to some extent, predictable. Australia is considerably impacted by these fluctuations and although is served by several operational prediction schemes, the associated degree of skill is, at best, only moderate. There now exist quite a number of dynamically-based seasonal prediction models which are global in extent and there is considerable interest in developing methods for maximizing and quantifying their skill and utility to potential end-users. It is also possible to assess their performance by accessing hindcast (retrospective prediction) data. One of these models was developed by CSIRO and is based on the CSIRO Mk3 global coupled climate model. Results from seven other models which comprise the DEMETER (""Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble system for seasonal to in TER annual prediction"") project were also assessed. This paper focuses on an assessment of the skill of the models at predicting rainfall for a catchment region of south-east Australia. In each case, rainfall hindcasts are compared with observed rainfall totals and also compared with observed inflows into one of the major reservoirs, the Burrinjuck dam. The major findings are: It is not possible to distinguish between the performance of the different models due to different sample sizes and periods for which hindcasts are available. Overall, the models exhibit an ability to capture, to some extent, variations in seasonal rainfall associated with ENSO events and this is evident in the fact that they exhibit skill in the extreme categories but not in the average category. The average success rate, while greater than that expected by chance or the strategy which assumes climatology, is not high and is expressed in the slight shifts in the probabilities for below average and above average tercile categories. As a rough guide, the model-based predictions provide an advantage over climatology 1 year in every 10. Taking into account the fact that rainfall and inflow predictions can be somewhat redundant when dealing with water storages, this may overestimate the potential utility to end-users. Finally, it has to be recognised that the economic value of predictions, no matter how skilful, can be diminished according to the costs/benefits associated with decisions made by the end-user.

The objective of this paper is to assess the impacts of climate change on river discharge dynamics in Oueme River basin in Benin. To this end, this paper used the distribution based scaling approach to improve usability of regional climate model projections for hydrological climate change impacts studies. Hydrological simulations in Beterou and Bonou sub-catchments of the Oueme River were carried out with a lumped conceptual hydrological model. The main contribution of this paper is to use the hydrological model based on the least action principle (HyMoLAP), which is designed to minimize uncertainties related to the rainfall-runoff process and scaling law, for this assessment. The bias correction approach allows reducing the differences between the observed rainfall and the regional climate model (HIRHAM5 and RCA4) rainfall data. Corrected and raw HIRHAM5 and RCA4 rainfall data were compared with the observed rainfall using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square error (RMSE). The results of the bias correction show a decrease in the RMSE and MAE of the raw HIRHAM5 and RCA4 rainfall data of approximately 91% to 98% in both catchments. The results of the simulation indicate that the HyMoLAP is suitable for modelling river discharge in the Oueme River basin. For the future projection based on RCP4.5 scenarios, the projected mean annual river discharge by using HIRHAM5 and RCA4 in Beterou and Bonou decrease with the magnitude ranging respectively from -25% to -39% and -20% to -37% in the three time horizons 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2100), representing the early, middle and late of 21st century.

One particular worry is the disastrous consequence to agriculture and food security sectors in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries. Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts of climate change. However, before planning adaptation policies or strategies to climate change, it is important to assess the impacts of climate change at regional and local scale to have scientific evidence that would guide the formulation of such policies or strategies. In this study the impacts of climate change on rain-fed maize (Zea Mays) production in the southern and western highlands sub-agro ecological zones of Tanzania are evaluated. High resolution climate simulations from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment_Regional ClimateModels (CORDEX_RCMs) were used as input into the Decision Support System for Agro-technological Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate maize yield in the historical climate condition (1971-2000), present (2010-2039), mid (2040-2069), and end (2070-2099) centuries. Daily rainfall, solar radiations, minimum and maximum temperatures for the historical (1971-2000) climate condition and future climate projections (2010-2099) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 were used to drive DSSAT. The impacts of climate change were assessed by comparing the average maize yields in historical climate condition against the average of simulated maize yields in the present, mid and end centuries under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Results of future maize yields estimates from DSSAT driven by individual RCMs under both RCP scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) differs from one RCM to another and from one scenario to another. This highlight the uncertainty associated with the projection. Results from the ensemble average of the yields indicated that maize yields will decline in future climate condition by 3.1 and 5.3% under RCP 4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. High decreases in maize yield of 9.6% are expected in the end centuries under RCP 8.5. The main reason for decline in maize yields during future climate is the increase in temperatures that will shorten the length of growing seasons. Seasonal minimum temperature and maximum temperature are expected to increase by 1.84 and 1.53 degrees C, respectively under RCP 4.5 and by about 2.72 and 2.2.degrees C, respectively, under RCP 8.5.

Yet there is still limited understanding of how to determine whether and how adaptation is occurring. Through qualitative analysis of focus group interviews, I evaluated individual behavioral responses to local forest stressors that can arguably be linked to global climate change among landowners in the Upper Midwest, USA. I found that landowner responses were planned as well as autonomous, more proactive than reactive, incremental rather than transformational, and aimed at being resilient to change and transitioning to new conditions, rather than resisting change alone. Many of the landowners' responses can be considered forms of adaptation, rather than coping, because they were aimed at moderating and avoiding harm on long time horizons in anticipation of change. These findings stand in contrast to the short-term, reactive, and incremental responses that current socio-psychological theories of adaptation suggest are more typical at the individual level. This study contributes to scientific understanding of how to evaluate behavioral adaptation to climate change and differentiate it from coping, which is necessary for developing conceptually rigorous analytical frameworks to guide research and policy.",2019.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Adapting and coping with climate change in temperate forests,Environmental studies & forestry,Alexandra Paige,Alexandra,1.0,1.0

We consider a simple endogenous growth model with a polluting non-renewable resource and directed technical change, in which the environmental damage (and unique externality) depends on the accumulated stock of pollutant as well as on a stock of green knowledge dedicated to its management. Here, the socially optimal policy consists in a tax on the environmental damage, which provides the right incentives to (a) invest in green knowledge and (b) mitigate pollutant flows.

However, there exist several challenges to the success of such restoration projects. In this paper, one such key challenge, that of the risk of extreme climatic events, is considered. Optimal rate of mangrove restoration on public coastal lands is derived in the presence of a future risk of extreme cyclones decimating the mangrove forests. Using the context of the Sundarbans region of India, which has the largest mangrove forests on the planet, we develop a model of community led restoration efforts where local inhabitants receive credit for carbon sequestered in the process. Results indicate that when communities do not receive outside support through wages or reimbursement of plantation costs, restoration efforts get spread over a longer time horizon. Presence of a risk of future cyclone events that could destroy the restored forests prompts speedier restoration, which may not be an optimal outcome from the perspective of global carbon mitigation efforts. An optimal plan that is primarily concerned with deriving sequestration benefits from newly restored mangroves leads to lower restoration levels in the presence of higher cyclone risks. However, irrespective of the institutional setting under which restoration is incentivized, given the relatively stable nature of underground carbon stored in mangroves, it is optimal to undertake higher restoration efforts when climatic risks are low.",2019.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Optimal mangrove restoration through community engagement on coastal lands facing climatic risks: The case of Sundarbans region in India,Environmental studies & forestry,Ram,Ram,0.0,0.0

To effectively manage these environmental impacts, spatially explicit information accounting for the differences in growing conditions and production practices across the production landscape is essential, allowing for high impact intensity corn to be identified and prioritized for improvement. To support these sustainability efforts, this study examines the spatially explicit life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of US county corn production, providing the most comprehensive assessment to date.MethodsA streamlined spatial life cycle assessment is conducted, focusing on the three key hotspots of corn production for spatial differentiation at the county scale across the contiguous USA, accounting for almost 60% of total average cradle-to-farm gate impacts. Variations in nitrogen fertilization types and rates, N2O emission rates, and irrigation emission rates are specifically revealed. Spatially distinguished hotspot inputs and related emissions are combined with static national average emission estimates from all other inputs used in corn production to gain a full picture and understand the relative contributions to total cradle-to gate impacts.Results and discussionResults show significant variation across corn producing counties, states, and regions. High impact priority locations are highlighted and key contributors of impact for each location are illuminated, providing critical information on the spatially explicit levers to reduce impacts. Results increase the generalizability of emission estimates using expected yields to characterize emission intensity, enabling more practical integration into company supply chain sustainability assessments to align with the time horizons in which decisions are made.ConclusionsStreamlined life cycle assessment methods are an effective way to characterize spatial heterogeneity around key contributors of impact, helping deliver the necessary information for companies, stakeholders, and policy makers to target their influence to reduce these emissions through various engagement efforts.",2019.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Engineering,Spatial greenhouse gas emissions from US county corn production,Engineering & technology,Rylie,Rylie,0.75,1.0

Most people prefer protection options. Governments and private land owners tend to adopt a wait-and-see approach for retreat. This may be because the time for retreat seems some way off, or because protection has not yet been ruled out, or to avoid unwelcome news. This policy void has allowed people to assume that government will offer to buyout property on generous terms after coastal hazards inevitably force the owner to relocate. The problem with that assumption is that (a) it is unaffordable as a solution for all at-risk properties and (b) it acts as an incentive to intensify development in locations vulnerable to coastal hazards. It is, in effect, a form of market distortion which promotes maladaptive behavior. We therefore need to retire that assumption by articulating a standard default arrangement for retreat. This essay suggests that government should establish a default position of renting land, rather than acquiring it, once assets are abandoned by private land owners. This provides sufficient leverage to protect the public interest and a level of financial assistance to the relocating land owner, while allowing markets to properly reflect risk and enabling coastal adaptation.",2018.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,How to Retreat: The Necessary Transition from Buyouts to Leasing,Environmental studies & forestry,Allan William,Allan,0.0,0.0

These ""timber wars"" were similar to forest environmental policy conflicts in several other countries, but were particularly polarized. They resulted in a significant change in Federal forest policy from timber production orientation to biodiversity conservation. The change occurred suddenly and had significant economic and social consequences within the region and beyond, but was embedded in long-term societal and institutional trends. In this paper, I adopt an interpretive approach in order to, first, understand contemporary interpretations of the 1993 policy change and, second, to reconstruct the contemporary discursive 'landscape' of the Pacific Northwest including the major resource management paradigms and narratives that guide policy making in this region today. Empirically, my interpretation is mostly built on 37 qualitative interviews with policy stakeholders that were conducted in the summer of 2011. Based on this evidence, the paper argues that there are four narratives circulating amongst policy stakeholders that represent different conceptualizations of the 1993 policy change. Yet, all narratives highlight the importance of environmental strategy making that mobilized the socio-institutional setting in order to prepare and finally achieve the change. Current forest policy in the region is characterized by a policy stalemate resulting from the confluence of diverse institutional, context-related factors and the inability of stakeholders to create enough contradictions or crisis by combining these factors in order to promote change-enabling narratives. Four resource management paradigms compete in the region and, within these, narratives and counter narratives on physical and social events are developed. Current forest policy is dominated by an ecosystem management paradigm, but forest management practices aim to reconcile demands arising from the different paradigms to a certain degree, for instance via the concept of ""ecological restoration"". Yet, given that the material base that feeds such compromises is finite, a new crisis in Pacific Northwest forest policy in the future is likely. In conclusion, this paper offers an interpretation of Pacific Northwest forest policy (change) as a process in which social and physical events are 'discursively mobilized' by means of narratives that are produced against the background of major natural resources paradigms. This includes the art of 'discourse agents' in constructing problematizations and intervention logics to either defend the current policy state or to increase the likelihood of change.

An ecological model of behavior is used as a framework for analyzing the complex relationship between sustainably focused policy initiatives and their success or failure at the individual level. Water cycle fluctuation will be significantly impacted by global climate change in upcoming decades and additional demand for potable water will increase due to growing urban populations. The reuse of residential graywater is an underutilized option for reducing potable water use, municipal energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions, with seemingly little negative impact on public health. The RGWO is a policy passed in Tucson, Arizona, requiring new single family and duplex housing be built with separate graywater plumbing to enable graywater recycling for irrigation. Local adaptations of such policies often depend on a variety of unforeseen factors and few studies have considered the role architects, activists, builders, and citizens play in the success of local climate adaptive initiatives. Data from in-depth guided interviews was used to develop insight into how different stakeholders can impact policy implementation.

This article reviews the driving forces of global warming and highlights the major contributors to this phenomenon and presents some of the mitigation techniques. Water vapor is responsible for two-third of the global warming; however, CO2 is considered as the controlling factor of the global warming. In other words, if the concentration of CO2 did not increase, global warming would not have happened. Scientists claim that doubling or halving the CO2 in the atmosphere causes the change in the average surface temperature of the earth by +3.8 degrees C or -3.6 degrees C, respectively. However, this amount of change depends on the change in the humidity of the air which in return depends on the air's temperature. Conversely, even though the other GHGs such as CH4 and N2O have stronger ability to absorb the radiation, their contribution in the global warming is insignificant because of their low concentration in the atmosphere compared with CO2. The adoption of the mitigation and adaptation strategies at the same time is the most effective economic and technical solution for the global warming issue.

Reliable estimates have pegged the urban population of the world by 2050 at 70%. To deal with the problems of urbanization such as population explosion, high level of pollution, traffic chaos, huge scarcity of houses, inadequate water supply, heaps of garbage, poor infrastructure, security concerns, unemployment, overpowering political set up, etc. the concept of inclusive Smart cities, evolved in the European Union and has now spread across the continents. Thus a new approach to take on the colossal challenges of this century has emerged. It is expected that the Smart Cities will address public issues, employing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions, on the basis of municipality driven multi-stakeholder partnership. The need to strengthen or extend citizens' participation in initiatives by Municipalities and emphasize establishment of more refined and accessible governance structure has been realized. While the concept of Smart Cities is still under development and evolution, it has caught on across the globe and has spearheaded a new approach to look at urban development and management. Cities have their own requirements and peculiar limitations necessitating public centric strategies, appropriate and economically viable technology and funding mechanisms. Cities accommodate nearly 31% of India's current population and contribute 63% of GDP. Urban areas are expected to house 40% of India's population and contribute 75% of India's GDP by 2030. Indian Government would earmarkUSD1054 million to fund the development of a hundred Smart Cities with a view to address various problems arising out of an accentuated rate of population influx. The Mission will have duration of five years (FY2015-16 to FY2019-20). The city level Pre-takeoff Plans in respect of quite a few cities are stimulating investment by engaging identified stakeholders i. e. ICT businesses, real estate developers, infrastructure providers, retail business and transport operators to support Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects and actions. The objective of Indian Smart City initiatives is to increase the resilience of the city. It is proposed to develop the 100 Smart Cities as Satellite Towns of larger cities by modernizing existing mid-sized cities. The aim is to promote cities that provide core infrastructure and give a decent quality of life to its citizens, a clean and sustainable environment and application of ` Smart' Solutions. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive development and the idea is to look at compact areas, create a replicable model which will act like a light house to other aspiring cities. The new initiative of the Government of India to make cities capable of facing the 21st century challenges with the generous reliance on the latest frontiers of technologies available, serious efforts towards capacity building of the personnel manning the projects and above all employing methods to make them financially sustainable with little aid will go a long way in creating a Resurgent Urban India. The importance of deploying advanced technologies for solving the problems of city governance with ease cannot be undermined.

This paper explores the influence of these factors as well as household socio-economic characteristics on autonomous household adaptation to climate change. George-town, Guyana is used as a case study. Empirical analysis revealed that state inability to solve socio-economic, infrastructural and environmental problems led urban households to independently adopt measures aimed at reducing climate change impacts. Spontaneous maladaptation by all households in response to state failure and weak urban governance, however, exacerbated vulnerability to flooding. The paper has global applicability in that it cautions policymakers and practitioners on the shortcomings of spontaneous maladaptation, and provides prescriptions for improved urban governance and spatial planning to facilitate the climate proofing of cities. Furthermore, it highlights the importance and complexities of financing climate change adaptation, and concludes these will continue to constrain the adaptive capacity of vulnerable city populations in the less developed countries of the South, unless developed global partners cooperate.

Economic theory suggests that adaptations are efficient (desirable) only if their benefit exceeds their cost. Private adaptations are likely to be efficient because the benefits and cost accrue to the decision maker. With some important exceptions, private adaptation is likely to be done efficiently by markets. Public adaptations, however, benefit many people. Markets are not likely to make efficient public adaptations because they cannot coordinate payments from multiple consumers. Governments need to be responsible for public adaptations. However, government must think carefully about being efficient. Empirically, little is known about what precise changes in behavior are efficient, where such changes should take place and when they should take place. The empirical literature has largely focused on how actors have adapted to the current range of climates across the earth. From these studies, researchers are extrapolating what changes would make sense in the future as climate changes. The results suggest that adaptations are local in nature and therefore look like patchwork adjustments across space. They depend on the current local climate, how it changes and the various local conditions. Although public adaptations in health and conservation look promising, there are virtually no economic analyses of their potential. Overall, adaptation can be very effective at reducing damages, for example, by building sea walls to protect from inundation, and seizing new opportunities, for example, by growing in crops in places that were previously too cold.

Understanding future climate and air quality has become one of the highest priorities for many countries and individual cities, where mitigation and adaptation could be planned. In Hong Kong, local government has pledged to reduce the GHG emissions by 60-65% from the 2005 level (i. e., 40 million tonnes CO2 equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2005) by 2030. The reduction focuses mainly on local energy saving, alternative transportation, and green energy generation. As Hong Kong moves into less carbon-intense technologies in both transportation and energy sectors, this much needed change will benefit the city's local air quality. Currently, no long-term carbon reduction plan for 2050 has been identified in the government. In terms of future air quality projections, strong relationships between emissions and pollutant concentrations have been observed in Southeastern China under the IPCC AR5 scenarios, where the reduction of regional emissions (e. g., SO2, NOx, and PM) has a great effect on future PM2.5 air quality. Overall, PM2.5 air quality over Pearl River Delta region has shown a clear improvement in 2050 under RCP8.5 emission scenario, with a mean concentration reduction of 5-15% (up to 12 mu g/m(3)). For ozone, a slight increase (i. e., 0-3%) of annual mean has been projected, which may be due to the combined effect of slow emission reduction of NMVOCs and less NOx titration in the VOCs limited regime.

However, air pollution control policies are often expensive and have side effects, especially by increasing or decreasing greenhouse gas emissions and thus influencing climate change. An integrated assessment of air pollution control policies thus has to take the effects on climate change into account and furthermore has to ensure, that the most efficient policy, i.e. the bundle of measures with the highest net benefit is chosen. Here, a methodology for carrying out an integrated assessment of air pollution control policies, the impact pathway approach, is described. The methodology includes the estimation of utility losses and is able to assess as well technical measures (that change emission factors, e.g. by using improved filters) as non-technical measures (e.g. changes in behaviour/activities, e.g. using public transport after an increase in fuel taxes). The method is then applied for identifying the most effective and efficient measures for reducing air pollution from transport activities in Europe. The results show, that the most efficient transport policies for improving air quality and protecting climate are more use of bicycles and e-bikes, better traffic management, rail replacing air transport, shore based electricity and tighter emission limits for ships, tighter EURO limits (EURO 7), low emission zones in cities (>= EURO V), improved tyres, brake pads and road cover and promotion of CNG and electric drive.",2016.0,,nan,Integrated Assessment of Policies for Reducing Health Impacts Caused by Air Pollution,Unknown,Rainer,Rainer,0.0,0.0

First, a number of criteria are proposed that a unilateral consumption-orientated policy should meet: it should promote environmental effectiveness or cost-effectiveness, should not impose additional economic burdens on developing and emerging economies, should be perceived as fair, should stand a chance of conforming to WTO rules, and its implementation should be practicable. From these criteria recommendations for practical policy design are deduced: border tax revenues should be allocated to developing and emerging economies; ""green"" technology transfer to this group of countries should be fostered; the application of export rebates in addition to import tariffs is an option, but it does not have large effects on policy effectiveness; and the adoption of ""green"" technologies by developing and emerging economies should be incentivized. This chapter argues that the last of these recommendations is extremely important for the environmental effectiveness of the policy; this recommendation will however be difficult to implement if the policy-as typically recommended for reasons of practicability-is based on carbon benchmarks or if at least a certain measure of cooperation by the countries affected by the policy cannot be guaranteed.",2015.0,,nan,Consumption-Based Climate Policy in Practice: Abatement Potentials Difficult to Exploit,Unknown,Christian,Christian,0.0,0.0

Although we live in a global world, it can be observed that interactions occur in each unit on an individual basis. As we have more and more knowledge and information on the space, we can indicate which units, regions and spaces have the greatest predisposition to be subject to climate change. Moreover, being aware of the level of risk, we can attempt to implement tools that will help society to accept climate change and properly adapt to it. A space's predisposition to climate change is not only determined by the weather, environmental or geographical conditions. The literature on the subject indicates three basic determinants of the predisposition, i.e. the exposure, vulnerability and the adaptive capacity. Only all of these elements grouped together can provide an answer to the question about a unit's predisposition.

Collectively, the cases and the model reveal causal pathways that may explain why any given SPR ends up functioning the way it does (e.g., external political conditions are important), implying prescriptions for improvement.

Faced with barriers to adaptation planning and implementation at the local level, growing numbers of practitioners have turned to the metropolitan region as a new scalar platform for climate adaptation planning. This study examines regional adaptation planning in Los Angeles, Miami, and Boston, three metropolitan areas that have significant exposure to the impacts of climate change and typify the high levels of administrative fragmentation found in the United States. I ask, what regional adaptation strategies have they deployed? What local adaptation challenges do they try to overcome? Given their progress, what are the implications for this scale of adaptation planning? Drawing on case studies of these efforts, I End that regional collaborations promisingly get more cities to start planning for the impacts of climate change, even in states where governments oppose climate action, by increasing access to information, providing opportunities for networking and technical assistance, helping secure additional funding, and strengthening coordination among vertical levels of government. However, local-centric regional adaptation efforts have had less success in addressing horizontal coordination challenges across municipalities, particularly as they relate to land use planning, fiscal constraints, spillovers effects, and social equity. These findings suggest that scaling up adaptation to the metropolitan region is no panacea for overcoming structural limits to local adaptation in places with weak regional governance institutions. More critical and reflexive regional adaptation planning can help pave the way to difficult conversations around regional institution building so that governance at this scale can achieve its promise of producing more effective and equitable adaptation.",2019.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Promise and paradox of metropolitan regional climate adaptation,Environmental studies & forestry,Linda,Linda,1.0,1.0

Near its mouth into the Pacific Ocean, the river is recharging a regionally important aquifer which is managed for drinking water production in the Blenheim region and for irrigation of New Zealand's largest wine growing area. The Wairau Plain Aquifer is almost exclusively recharged by the Wairau River and closely related to its hydrological regime. The groundwater levels and spring flows at the Wairau Plain Aquifer have shown progressive decline in the past decades. This study analyses potential factors to explain this trend and a change in the hydrological regime using a combination of field investigations and a detailed numerical flow model. Results indicate that the driving forces of the system, rainfall and runoff, exhibit not only a strong interannual variability but seem to be also correlated with longer climate oscillations. The groundwater storage is also affected by strong seasonal variations and is particularly vulnerable to the frequency and duration of low-flow periods in summer. Climate variability alone, however, does not explain the log-term trends in storage. Another factor is the erosion of the Wairau River bed which can lead to a permanent loss of storage capacity and is caused by the effects of river training but also by extreme flood events. Another factor that should be taken into consideration is groundwater abstraction for irrigation, which accounts only for 1% of the total estimated storage, but up to 20% of the ""live"" manageable storage.The better understanding of the mechanisms and factors controlling the Wairau Plain Aquifer contributes to the identification of adaptation strategies for a sustainable management of the groundwater resources.",2019.0,BUNDESANSTALT GEWASSERKUNDE-BFG,Water Resources,"Natural and anthropogenic factors controlling the hydrological regime of the Wairau Plain Aquifer, New Zealand",Geography,Thomas,Thomas,0.0,0.0

The paper highlights the relevance of exploring prudential policy responses, including a harmonized taxonomy, statistical and reporting framework that could contribute to internalizing the negative externalities associated with climate risks by both banks and their supervisors. Among the prudential supervisory tools, credit registers facilitate the assessment of environmental risk drivers in carbon stress tests. This paper also presents a framework of analysis for the regulatory treatment of climate-related risks. Design/methodology/approach Similarly to Weyzig et al. (2014), this paper uses financial databases on the banks' role as book runners for syndicated loans; that is, as the lead arrangers who also provide a large share of the actual lending. Loans are outstanding on December 31, 2014, and the paper assumes linear amortization of loans issued before that date and with maturity after that date. This study includes the largest banks from the above-mentioned countries with financial information available in SNL Financial and EU banks with financial information available in the ECB database on December 31, 2014. By assessing the relative share of the ten largest (or total reporting if less) banks' exposure to each high environmental risk sector in relation to their total assets, these findings can be extrapolated across sectors in the respective country. Findings This paper quantifies the loan exposure to elevated environmental risk sectors of the banking system in the USA, EU, China, Japan and Switzerland in US$1.6tn, broadly in line with the findings of Battiston et al. (2017) and Weyzig et al. (2014). This paper also explores prudential policy approaches and tools. In addition to the lack of taxonomy of brown vs green, the paper identifies the limitations to assess the risks involved in the transition to a low-carbon economy: supervisory reports that do not make full use of the existing international statistical framework (e.g. EU COREP and FINREP); lack of harmonized reporting requirements of environmental risks; lack of credit registers as tools to perform carbon stress-testing; and supervisors' governance framework that do not internalize environmental risks (e.g. proposed revision of the Basel Core Principles of Banking Supervision). As per the stress-testing, the paper presents two examples. The paper presents a framework of analysis for the regulatory treatment of climate-related risks. The author identifies two critical elements of such framework if prudential regulation of environmental risks is to be considered: the consideration or not of climate risk as credit risk and the impact of environmental risks over probabilities of default over the entire business cycle. Research limitations/implications No internationally accepted official taxonomy of high environmental risk sectors exists. This paper uses Moody's (2015a) classification of sectors according to their environmental risk exposure. This paper's exposures do not reflect the real risk exposure of these institutions and the banking industry as a whole because, as explained in Page 6, these values are without regard to bilateral loans and guarantees and securitizations of loans; in the case of loans to power generation companies, renewable sources are not excluding and, similarly, for the production of electric vehicles, loans are not excluded. Furthermore, this paper does not assess banks' exposures to sovereigns subject to high environmental risks and bonds and equity issued by corporations operating in high environmental risk sectors. Practical implications Contribution to the present policy debate on how to regulate banks' exposure to high environmental risk and how to manage the transition to a low-carbon economy. Social implications This paper can increase awareness of the banking sector transition risks to a low-carbon economy.

Methods: This qualitative study has employed narrative methodology to interpret the meaning of climate change among community leaders in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada, age 20-40 (n = 10). Climate change narratives were explored both structurally and thematically. Results: A model was developed to organize results and to describe concepts of fidelity and dissonance within participant narratives. Findings suggested that knowledge of climate change and personal motivation to act did not preclude narrative dissonance, which served as a barrier to a meaningful personal response. Dissonance can result where internal and external barriers mediate mobilization at moments in the plot: (1) moving from knowledge of the challenge to a sense of agency about it; (2) from agency to a sense of responsibility to choose to address it; (3) from responsibility to a sense of capacity to produce desirable outcomes despite contextual challenges; and (4) from capacity to a moral sense of activation in context. Without narrative fidelity, meaningful mobilization can be hindered. Conclusions: A narrative model is useful for exploring climate change engagement and highlights opportunities for a population health approach to address the conditions that hinder meaningful mobilization.

I then use a commodity chains framework to (1) reveal how program managers in Scolel'te sought to protect the program in the face of such risk by using their relative positions of power to govern how carbon credit producing farmers operated and (2) illustrate the implications of this market risk and the decisions of program managers for farmers participating in the program. I find that the governance decisions made by program managers in the face of market risk led to a series of unintended outcomes that included the dissolution of the social relations of production between program managers and carbon credit-producing farmers as well as the social relations within participating communities. As a result, farmers began to leave the program, abandoning their agroforestry plantings and limiting the full realization of the program's positive environmental and social outcomes in the region.",2019.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Geography,Precarious Participation: Assessing Inequality and Risk in the Carbon Credit Commodity Chain,Geography,Jonathan,Jonathan,0.0,0.0

Urban settings are particularly susceptible to the impacts of extreme weather events due to high population densities with shared exposure pathways. Moreover, metropolitan areas tend to be at increased risk from heat waves because urban climates are often warmer than un-built surroundings. Three aspects of urban adaptation to climate change are addressed here: (1) social interventions that advance bonding, bridging, and linking social capital in order to enhance community capacity and resilience; (2) interventions that attenuate the negative consequences of climatic events by physically improving the built environment; and (3) social services interventions that integrate multiple sectors through emergency plans for risk reduction of vulnerable populations. These adaptation strategies in urban environments illustrate the concept of lateral public health based on transdisciplinary cooperation and community-based participation. In order to mount an effective response, public health practitioners need to transcend the traditional disciplinary boundaries and embrace lateral public health.

Through a top-down analysis, the variables of climate change that impact on the supply and demand equilibrium for tourism and aviation are defined, and based on a gap analysis framework, the relationship of these variables to the aviation and tourism equilibrium is given. Conventional wisdom is to provide key messages to aviation authorities, decision makers and stakeholders regarding the expected changes in demand, the implications in airport operation and the effects in regional economic development, especially, for regions that are highly reliant upon income from tourism.

The hydrodynamic regime of the Blyth estuary (Suffolk, eastern England) is governed by a distinctive morphology that has resulted from the abandonment of a reclaimed midestuary tidal floodplain in the 1920s and 1940s. Hypsometric characteristics (extensive intertidal area and constricted inlet dimensions) make the outer estuary potentially sensitive to sea-level rise. Model results indicate that a sea-level rise of 0.3 m (as a best estimate scenario for 2050) could increase peak tidal current velocities and discharges by up to 20% and 28%, respectively. Extensive areas of potential tidal floodplain remain protected by embankments that will require upgrading to cope with sea-level rise. Realignment (or ""managed retreat"") of these defences can reduce local flood defence costs by eliminating unsustainable seawall but needs to be evaluated in the light of wider impacts. Modelling of hypothetical realignment scenarios shows that restoration of tidal exchange to the largest flood compartments could have an immediate effect on outer estuary hydrodynamics that is larger than worst case scenarios for half a century of accelerated sea-level rise (peak velocity and discharge increased by up to 35% and 32%, respectively).

Historic coastal cities must reconcile tensions between preserving a community's existing cultural heritage and the reality of planning for several feet of sea level rise in the coming decades. As more frequent tidal flooding and more extensive storm surges begin to affect the lowest-lying neighborhoods, cities and states are faced with decisions about where and when to invest in adaptation measures and at what scale. Adaptation measures will undoubtedly change the landscape of the existing built environment, which contributes to each community's cultural heritage and its collective psyche. How can a community move forward with the joint goals of preservation and protection? The decisions are daunting and imagining a built environment that accommodates a rising sea can be a surreal exercise. Questions will be raised such as, what funds are available for large-scale infrastructure projects? Or, why is investment continuing in this neighborhood if it will be under water in fifty years? Architects may feel unequipped to enter these conversations. The easiest, and likely last, series of decisions in this process may be about how to elevate a building. However, before arriving at such a decision, an interconnected web of related conversations must occur. Despite one's reluctance to participate in such a daunting task, a designer's skill set is useful in the process. The assistance that is required of architects at the front end of preparing historic coastal communities for sea level rise includes gathering and presenting existing conditions data, facilitating robust and inclusive conversations, educating decision-makers, and illustrating options, all of which empower communities to work together toward an appropriate and equitable solution. Architects have an opportunity to not only facilitate and participate in adaptation planning conversations, but also to advocate for and influence the structure of decision-making processes to be more inclusive and participatory.

Both climatic and human variables have been important but overall the balance of research conclusions indicates natural processes (precipitation totals, wind strength) have had greater impact than human action, in the latter case both in the form of mismanagement (abandoned farmland, water management schemes) and attempts to reduce wind erosion (afforestation projects). Understanding the drivers of change in dust storm dynamics at the local scale is increasingly important for efforts to mitigate dust storm hazards as climate change projections suggest that the global dryland area is likely to expand in the twenty-first century, along with an associated increase in the risk of drought and dust emissions.",2019.0,MDPI,Geology,Variability and Trends in Dust Storm Frequency on Decadal Timescales: Climatic Drivers and Human Impacts,Earth sciences,Nick,Nick,0.0,0.0

Ongoing natural processes are integrated with anthropogenic impacting factors to rationalize the contribution of each impact type within a total system. From baseline conditions of today, two natural processes account for approximately 85% of the estimated cumulative land loss by 2050: (1) subsidence by sediment compaction and tectonism that is driven by the weight of the Mississippi Delta's sedimentary pile and (:2) absolute sea-level rise. Hurricanes are sudden natural processes that act as impact accelerators. After the Mississippi River became hydrologically isolated from the delta it built, anthropogenic impacts coinciding with the ramp up to peak oil production in the Louisiana coastal area caused many direct impacts, such as the construction of access canals and pipelines, but indirect impacts are largely symptomatic of natural delta platform submergence. Formation extraction is the only significant anthropogenic activity influencing projected land losses: about 6%. Other anthropogenic activities, such as onshore development, maintenance dredging, and oil spills, are not significant impacting factors. Additive processes, such as delta outbuilding and coastal restoration, are also not significant. A growing body of Louisiana coastal area subsidence studies is proceeding in absence of insight as to how conclusions might be ordered by the subsurface structural fabric that has influenced coastal geomorphology and that continues to influence surface processes. Subsidence assessments have been heavily weighted with inputs based on surface and near-surface data sets that are easy to see and touch.

Today, wetlands are highly valued for many functions including temporary storage of surface water, streamflow maintenance, nutrient transformation, sediment retention, shoreline stabilization, and provision of fish and wildlife habitat. Government agencies and other organizations are actively developing plans to help protect, conserve, and restore wetlands in watersheds. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory Program (NWI) has produced wetland maps, digital geospatial data, and wetland trends data to aid these and other conservation efforts. Most recently, the NWI has developed procedures to expand the amount of information contained within its digital databases to characterize wetlands better. It has also developed techniques to use these data to predict wetland functions at the watershed level. Working with the states of Delaware and Maryland, the NWI applied these techniques to the Nanticoke River watershed to aid those states in developing a watershed-wide wetland conservation strategy. Wetland databases for pre-settlement and contemporary conditions were prepared. An assessment of wetland functions was conducted for both time periods and comparisons made. Before European settlement, the Nanticoke watershed had an estimated 93,000 ha of wetlands covering 45% of the watershed. By 1998, the wetland area had been reduced to 62% of its original extent. Sea-level rise and wetland conversion to farmland were the principal causes of wetland loss. From the functional standpoint, the watershed lost over 60% of its original capacity for streamflow maintenance and over 35% for four other functions (surface-water detention, nutrient transformation, sediment and particulate retention, and provision of other wildlife habitat). This study demonstrated the value of enhanced NWI data and its use for providing watershed-level information on wetland functions and for assessing the cumulative impacts to wetlands.

Deltas, being at the land water interface, are international, regional, and local transport hubs, thus providing the basis for intense economic activities. Yet, deltas are disappearing and deteriorating at an alarming rate as ""victims"" of human actions (e.g. water and sediment reduction due to upstream basin development), climatic impacts (e.g. sea level rise and flooding from rivers and intense tropical storms), and local exploration (e.g. sand or aggregates, groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction). Although many efforts exist on individual deltas around the world, a comprehensive global delta sustainability initiative that promotes awareness, science integration, data and knowledge sharing, and development of decision support tools for an effective dialogue between scientists, managers and policy makers is lacking. Recently, the international scientific community proposed to establish the International Year of Deltas (IYD) to serve as the beginning of such a Global Delta Sustainability Initiative. The IYD was proposed as a year to: (1) increase awareness and attention to the value and vulnerability of deltas worldwide; (2) promote and enhance international and regional cooperation at the scientific, policy, and stakeholder level; and (3) serve as a launching pad for a 10-year committed effort to understand deltas as complex socio-ecological systems and ensure preparedness in protecting and restoring them in a rapidly changing environment.

High salt marshes in front of sea walls reduce the wave-impact on the dikes and, therewith, the danger of breaching. At the same time, the salt marshes have a high ecological value, e.g., as resting places for migratory birds. In consequence, for coastal defence, salt marshes should be created and/or maintained. For nature protection, natural dynamic processes (incl. erosion) should prevail. To anticipate this possible conflict among coastal defence and environmental administration, in Schleswig-Holstein an interdepartmental working group established a salt marsh management concept. For information of the interested parties and for monitoring of the concept, an integrated salt marsh board was established, consisting of representatives from public administration and local interest groups (NGO's, dike and water boards, municipalities). Five years after implementation of the concept, this board established a first progress report.

My aim is to improve understanding by examining how entrepreneurs, key agents of change, might use experiments to advance their climate innovations. Policy entrepreneurs can benefit in several ways from using experiments, including assessing public response to new ideas and learning. I address the question: What role can experiments play in an entrepreneur's change strategies? To answer this, a set of 18 policy experiments from Dutch water management was analyzed to understand how the policy experiments functioned as 4 different policy change strategies. The results revealed that organizers use experiments to evaluate their preformed ideas, to soften local communities to the idea of experimentation, to build broad but centrally controlled coalitions, and to link with influential political actors and national programs to maintain visibility and relevance. These insights formed a list of suggestions that the experiment organizers identified as key to the change strategies. Based on this, a number of recommendations about design choices were made for entrepreneurs who want to experiment. Analyzing experiments as change strategies contributes a novel perspective on how policy experiments function as venues for invention and provides useful suggestions on how experiments can be designed to improve their influence over policy-making processes.",2019.0,RESILIENCE ALLIANCE,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Connecting policy change, experimentation, and entrepreneurs: advancing conceptual and empirical insights",Environmental studies & forestry,Belinda K.,Belinda,1.0,1.0

Over this time, the amount of forest edge at this ecotone nearly doubled. In addition, the average amount of forest retreat was 141.2 m while the amount of salt marsh inland migration was 41.9 m. Variation in forest retreat within the study area was influenced by variation in slope. The lag between the amount of forest retreat and salt marsh migration is accounted for by the presence of Phragmites australis which occupies the forest and salt marsh ecotone. Phragmites expands from this edge into forest dieback areas, and the ability of salt marsh to move inland and displace Phragmites is likely influenced by salinity at both an estuary-wide scale and at the scale of local subwatersheds. Inland movement of salt marsh is lowest at lower salinity areas further away from the mouth of the estuary and closer to local heads of tide.

This study investigated physiological stress levels within sub-populations of wild koalas encountering environmental trauma and disease from New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (QLD) and South Australia (SA). Physiological stress was determined using a faecal glucocorticoid (or cortisol) metabolites (FGMs) enzyme-immunoassay (EIA) from 291 fresh faecal samples collected from wild koalas at the point of rescue. A healthy breeding sub-population from a forest reserve in QLD acted as a control group. Clearance of prime Eucalyptus habitat had the largest impact on FGMs, followed by bushfire related factors (e.g. flat demeanour, dehydration and burns injury). Koalas with other sources of physical injury (dog-attacks and vehicle collisions) and disease (chlamydia) also had higher FGMs compared to healthy wild koalas. Healthy wild koalas expressed the lowest median levels of FGMs. Overall, the results highlight that anthropogenic-induced stressors tend to increase physiological stress in wild koalas. Thus, the ultimate stressors such as habitat clearance and bush fire events could increase the incidences of proximate stressors such as dog attacks and vehicle collisions, and increase risks of foliage shortage, diseases and mortality.

The analysis shows that cultural ecosystem services feature especially strongly within the plans, and that these cultural services are critical to recovering sense of identity and pride post-disaster. However, the analysis also indicates that municipalities may lack the technical competence to assess ecosystem services, especially in a post-disaster setting where resources are stretched. One implication from the research is the need for further consideration in other empirical contexts of how cultural services - especially citizen participation - can be integrated with more technical approaches to post-disaster ecosystem management. A second implication is that whilst ecosystem approaches offer post-disaster resilience benefits, these should be an aid to recovery and not a substitute for long-term support from national governments.",2019.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Enhancing post-disaster resilience by 'building back greener': Evaluating the contribution of nature-based solutions to recovery planning in Futaba County, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan",Environmental studies & forestry,Leslie,Leslie,0.625,

The extent of seawalls and revetments along the shoreline suggests that they are a necessity, but the numerous issues associated with them suggests much disagreement or differences of opinion about this necessity. The fact that approximately 130 miles of California's coast is now protected by armoring (similar to 12% of the entire state's shoreline) is indicative of the magnitude of development in hazardous areas. That the extent of protection increased 400% in the 21 years between 1971 and 1992 suggests that this is a continuing issue. Over the past fifty years, the principal response to coastal hazards in California, whether bluff erosion or wave attack, has been the construction of seawalls or rock revetments. These protective structures have usually been constructed only after existing shoreline development or infrastructure, whether public or private, has been threatened by wave attack or erosion. Rarely in the past has a protection strategy or armor plan preceded development. At present day costs of $5 - $15 million/mile for protective structures, this represents an enormous investment. Presently, some of California's coastal municipalities, primarily in the southern portion of the state, require a protective structure as a condition for development of oceanfront property. In striking contrast, other communities, particularly those along the central coast, will not allow oceanfront development in locations where a protective structure would be necessary to insure the survival of the property through the economic life of the structure (normally 50-100 years). In recent years, considerable opposition has often arisen when new seawalls or revetments have been proposed because of the perceived direct or indirect impacts of these structures. These potential impacts include visual impacts, restrictions on beach access, loss of beach due to placement of structure, public subsidy for private property owners, and reduction of sand supply from previously eroding coastal bluffs following armoring. An additional issue which has arisen with the proliferation of coastal armoring has been that of the potential impacts of a seawall on the beach itself. Does the emplacement of a seawall or revetment lead directly to beach loss? Long term field investigations of seawalls and adjacent beaches along the coastline of Monterey Bay have helped us answer this complex question. The growing recognition of the limitations and impacts of ""hard"" protective structures has led to the consideration and implementation of ""soft"" strategies such as beach nourishment, which while soft, is neither free nor permanent. Moreover, the high capital and maintenance costs of seawalls and revetments, as well as the cutoff of federal funds for such projects, has led to the economic justification and reconsideration of relocating threatened oceanfront structures. The state of California needs to craft a consistent, comprehensive and long range policy on coastal armoring and protection for the entire coastline. Through a process of hazard recognition and evaluation, and then a standardized set of avoidance, mitigation, or hazard reduction policies, the private and public losses from future shoreline erosion, storm impact, and sea level rise can be significantly reduced.",1998.0,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,Engineering,The armoring of California's coast,Engineering & technology,GB,GB,,

Third, the focus on global cities or alternative locations that are constructed as exemplary sites takes attention away from the ordinary contexts of action where climate action is most needed. The second part of the paper uses this analysis as the main motivation for a call for studies of climate change governance to engage with the messiness of urban knowledge and action. Three theories of messiness are put forward. The first relates the idea of governance as messiness to postcolonial analyses of radical environmental action.

Place attachment can act as either a barrier to transformative adaptation or as a motivator for action. While highlighting areas of disagreement between local stakeholders, conflicts such as the Cork dispute can also represent new opportunities to engage wider constituencies with hazards management and to bring new perspectives into the decision-making process. The emergence of place attachment as a cross cutting theme illustrates that using place as a boundary concept around which to centre the decision-making process may allow for the testing of new approaches to hazards management and climate change adaptation.

The results are validated against high-resolution raingauge data for western Austria and the adjacent northern foreland in Bavaria. It is found that refining the mesh size from 9 km to 1 km has a highly beneficial impact in the Alpine part of the area of investigation, which can be explained by the fact that a proper representation of the topography is a necessary precondition for simulating the observed small-scale precipitation variability. The model skill at small scales is found to be better for stable orographic precipitation than in the presence of embedded convective cells because the latter induce a stochastic component in the precipitation field. Moreover, the impact of the cloud microphysics scheme increases with increasing model resolution. In the Alpine foreland, the impact of enhancing the model resolution turns out to be small and not necessarily beneficial.

The effects of subsidence on salt marshes are comparable to the effects of a rise in sea level, which mag become a world-wide threat to coastal marshes by affecting the marsh vegetation through an increased number of tidal floodings and an increase in wave energy. Comparison of the prognosis for subsidence with a large dataset on the accretion of various salt marshes over the past 25 years shows that accretion generally is expected to remain positive, even if at the same time sea level should rise by as much as 6 mm per year. In general, the salt marsh zone in the Wadden Sea can cope with subsidence and/or a sea level rise of 5 mm per year for barrier islands and 10 mm for the mainland, which is in the range of future sea level rise. This is an important marsh characteristic when considering its role for nature conservation and coastal protection. An accretional deficit is however expected in the pioneer zone in front of the salt marsh, which is situated on an elevation which is most affected by wave action and currents and lacks the protection of a closed vegetation cover. Vertical erosion in the pioneer zone will lead to horizontal cliff erosion of the salt marsh zone. This might become a general effect of future sea level rise on the world salt marsh resource. Existing management techniques in the pioneer zone of the Wadden Sea salt marshes (brushwood groynes which decrease wave energy and currents) can be optimized to increase sedimentation and vegetation settlement in this pioneer zone. Expectations for the impact of subsidence due to gas extraction on Netherlands salt marshes are in general not negative, if the local accretional balance is made a precondition for the rate of gas extraction.

When a model is adjusted and verified for a particular coastal region, it may also be used for predicting potential impact due to sea level rise for that region. Applications include coastal flood risk analysis, alteration of long-term coastal sediment transport direction, and possible impact on the ecosystem due to changes in the coastal circulation pattern induced by the rise of mean sea level. This paper presents some examples for such applications including storm surge and near-shore tidal residual circulation patterns due to sea level rise. The paper presents a brief background discussion on the coastal hydrodynamic process A three-dimensional numerical model of the China Sea is used as an example for the analyses. Results from the numerical experiment indicate sea level rise may induce long-term changes in the near-shove tidal circulation patterns resulted from the alteration of residual currents, Rise in sea level would also cause more areas to he flooded due to storm surge. Existing sea walls and dikes designed for 100 year storm would be exposed to higher risks in the face of rising mean sea level.

Salt-marsh ecosystems are important indicators of environmental change as the dynamics are governed by interacting physical and biological processes, whose intertwined feedbacks critically affect the evolution. Settling deposition of inorganic sediment allows the platform to reach a threshold elevation for vegetation encroachment; the presence of vegetation then intensifies rates of accretion, thus, enhancing the resilience of marshes to increasing rates of sea level rise (SLR). The results from a two-dimensional numerical model, accounting for biotic and geomorphic processes, show that different morphological evolutionary regimes are followed depending on marsh biological processes. The average marsh elevation within the tidal frame decreases with increasing rates of SLR, decreasing availability of sediment, and decreasing productivity of vegetation. The spatial variability in platform elevations increases with increasing rates of SLR, increasing availability of sediment, and decreasing productivity of vegetation. Supply-limited settings tend to develop uniform marsh surface elevations, whereas supply-rich settings tend to develop patterns of sedimentation where large heterogeneities in marsh surface elevations occur. The complexity observed in tidal geomorphological patterns is deemed to arise from the mutual influence of biotic and abiotic components. The fate of tidal landforms and their possible geomorphological restoration should, thus. be addressed through approaches which explicitly incorporate bio-morphodynamic processes.

Recent proposals from Washington are to cut the federal share of hurricane and storm surge protection, inlet maintenance, sand bypassing, beach restoration, and periodic renourishment projects in Florida. Although Florida has more beach erosion control projects than all the other states combined, erosion is still a problem for some 700 km of shore and has reached ''critical'' levels along 370 km of Florida beachfront where development or recreation are threatened. Of 215 km of erosion that have been studied, 140 km have been restored; the remainder has been abandoned because erosion rates are too high. If the average federal 50% cost-share for coastal protection is eliminated, local governments will have to support future projects at a minimal rate of $20-40 million per year. The annual cost of shore protection is modest compared to income generated by beach-related activities in Florida which overall bring in about $1.5 billion in annual sales. Alternative proposals to forego beach renourishment altogether, because it is ''too expensive,'' suggest that new Lines will be drawn in the sand for construction control and erosion setbacks. Due to relative sea-level rise (which includes land subsidence), natural background shoreline recession rates for the Florida Atlantic coast now average between 0.3-0.4 m a(-1). Accelerated rates of coastal erosion are associated with beaches backed by seawalls and coastal segments lying downdrift from stabilized inlets. Because jetties are littoral drift blockers, they are responsible for about 85% of Florida's beach erosion problem. Erosion Bents, which migrate downbeach from jetties at a rate of about 1 km a(-1), can quickly impact long coastal segments in a few years. Just south of the Port Everglades inlet, for example from DEP monuments R86-R91, beach hn placed in 1989 eroded 60 m in 6 years for an annual shoreline recession rate of 10 m a(-1), or a volume loss of 10 m(3) m(-1) a(-1). Additional erosion hot spots occur downcoast from other trained (jettied) inlets and elsewhere along the coast With the present total annual net loss at 3-5% by volume of beach sand in Broward County, about two-thirds to one-hall of the Atlantic dry beach width will remain within a decade, by around 2007. This new line in the sand will reflect loss of both artificially replenished beaches and natural beaches alike. Without replenishment, the volume of eroded beach sand in Broward County alone will probably amount to something on the order of 5.2 x 10(6) to 8.6 x 10(4) m(3). This magnitude of unrecovered decadel sand volume loss translates into future problems of greater magnitude than exist today. Salient among them is the prospect that fewer tourists will visit narrower, eroded beaches and the Florida economy win realize significantly less income from a major but declining economic resource. A management policy of 'no new beach replenishment activities' will in the first decade: (1) cause accelerated loss of beaches, (2) place a larger proportion of the coastal population at risk from flooding, (3) increase vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to hoods and inundation, (4) decrease revenue from tourism, and (5) result in higher costs for future shore protection. The proposed federal policy would be environmentally shortsighted, fiscally irresponsible, and negligent of proper methods of beach management. It is perhaps ironic to note that America has no national shore protection policy, that sand has become a restorrative resource of choice (opposed to hard, structural stabilization methods), and at a time when sand resources on the outer continental shelf may become available for beach renourishment, the Clinton Administration is proposing to put the brakes on soft shoreline stabilization.",1996.0,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,What might happen to America's shorelines if artificial beach replenishment is curtailed: A prognosis for southeastern Florida and other sandy regions along regressive coasts,Environmental studies & forestry,CW,CW,,

Elsewhere, there exist ridge plains composed of lithic gravel, coral shingle, shell (cheniers), and, in one location, a ridge of pumice. These ridge sequences also lie above the zone of normal wave (noncyclonic) processes. There is little doubt that these ridges are deposited by waves and it is likely that only tropical cyclone-generated marine inundations are able to cause the necessary ephemeral rise in sea level in order to emplace them. Tropical cyclones also cause substantial erosion of the coast. When the marine inundation (surge + tide + wave set-up + waves + wave run-up) or just wave run-up alone overtops coastal dunes (eolian) or ridges where they are unconsolidated, those dunes are eroded vertically and removed. At times, this can result in the deposition of sand sheets that extend inland for several hundreds of meters and taper in thickness landward. The sedimentary coast of northern Australia is composed therefore of a mosaic of landforms that represent the constant interplay between high-intensity, low-frequency events and processes and high-frequency, lower energy processes.

This paper integrates the unit cost information of six main flood adaptation measure categories: (1) the flood-proofing of buildings, (2) flood protection, (3) beach nourishment and dunes, (4) nature-based solutions for coastal ecosystems, (5) channel management and nature-based solutions for riverine systems, and (6) urban drainage. Cost estimates are corrected for inflation and converted to U.S. dollars (2016). Measures are described, and cost figures for both developed and developing countries are provided. The results of this study can be used as input for economic-assessment studies on flood adaptation measures.",2018.0,MDPI,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,A Review of Cost Estimates for Flood Adaptation,Environmental studies & forestry,Jeroen C.

Dasymetric mapping is used to redistribute block group level census data to homogeneous inhabited zones of 30 m x 30 m. Because the 100 year floodplain does not correspond to block group boundaries, this data redistribution increases the resolution and accuracy of the floodplain population and their social characteristics. Data on poverty, age, vehicle ownership and mobile housing units are obtained for each 30 m x 30 m zone in the floodplain and is aggregated to the block group level. It is then used to assess evacuation assistance need (based on volume of need as well as concentration of need) for the floodplain in each block group. Results reveal variations in evacuation need across the floodplain. ""Age"" is the main driver of evacuation need along the coast. ""Poverty"" is a factor inland, in both urban and rural areas. ""Lack of vehicle ownership"" contributes to assistance need in coastal and inland urban areas, but not so much in rural areas. ""Mobile housing"" is a factor in rural areas. Miami-Dade County has higher volume and concentration of poor households lacking vehicular ownership. Palm Beach and Broward counties, on the other hand, have a more dominant presence of elderly and of mobile housing. These results have important implications for local and regional evacuation planning in the event of a 100 year flood. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Being a comparatively new approach to coastal management, this increased usage has occurred against a background of little firm knowledge of the longer term impacts. This review gathers together a range of different research areas in an attempt to inform some of these issues. Most notable appears to be the role of pre-realignment vegetation on a site, both in terms of its role in increasing sediment accumulation as a way of enhancing new salt marsh growth, and, conversely, in its decay and generation of anoxic conditions, delaying the onset of marsh growth. Other factors include larger scale changes in soil properties, often governed by what has happened in terms of improvement during its agricultural history, size and shape of the site, and the ability to restore ecosystem functioning. Overall, the message here is that whilst realignment presents a logical and sound approach to increasing estuarine marsh loss, there are important lessons still to be learnt. Some of these can be informed from existing schemes, and some from looking at historic storm-breached sites. Overall, however, there are still major questions to be answered, with much of the required knowledge having to come from existing realignment sites at some point in the future.

A qualitative study exploring conditions of the urban poor in Khulna, Bangladesh demonstrates how the appropriation of private, parochial and public spaces by residents of informal settlements influences their capacity to cope with climate risks. Because of the spatial implications of the predominant patriarchal system, women remain vulnerable in private spaces. The parochial spaces they use for productive work also leave them exposed and sensitive to climate hazards. On the other hand, men, who make greater use of public spaces, still have negligible capacity to take any anticipatory and reactive actions in response to risks there. This paper, which provides a comparison to earlier research in Dhaka, argues that gendered constraints in both inhabiting and shaping spaces is an underlying cause of differential climate resilience; alternatively, planning climate-resilient spaces can be seen as a fundamental change contributing to transformative adaptation.",2019.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Gendered space and climate resilience in informal settlements in Khulna City, Bangladesh",Environmental studies & forestry,Huraera,Huraera,,

Most studies have so far focused on phenological responses to warming in multiple taxa across space and time, or the ontogenetic effects of temperature in the laboratory. I here complement this work by investigating shifts in phenology and body size (wing length) attributable to temperature changes operating over the entire lifespan of the univoltine orange-tip butterfly Anthocharis cardamines in a single wild population over 14 generations. Phenology was affected by temperatures during three discrete periods in the year prior to emergence, corresponding to late larval/early pupal life, the onset of the chilling period required to break pupal diapause, and postdiapause pupal development prior to eclosion. Higher temperatures during late larval/early pupal life and postdiapause pupal development advanced the subsequent emergence of the butterflies, whereas higher temperatures at the onset of the chilling period retarded it. The synchronization of the butterflies' emergence schedule increased when pupae were exposed to milder midwinter temperatures. Wing length increased with warmer temperatures at distinct points in the early and midpupal periods; such direct effects of temperature on body size could complement season length effects in explaining the reversal of the temperature-size rule in univoltine insects. The periods during which temperature affected the phenology of the butterfly only partially overlapped those affecting the first flowering date of its host plants lady's smock (Cardamine pratensis) and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata). Observed thermal effects on flowering time, emergence timing, and emergence synchronization indicate that phenological convergence as well as phenological mismatching could affect host-plant availability and diet breadth; thermal effects on body size imply that important population-level processes could be impacted through correlated changes in fecundity and dispersal rate. In general, the combined effects of phenological and ontogenetic responses to temperature changes across the whole lifespan will likely be important in modeling the demographic responses of interacting species to climate change.",2019.0,WILEY,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Multiple temperature effects on phenology and body size in wild butterflies predict a complex response to climate change,Environmental studies & forestry,W.

This rule is named after C.W.L. Gloger who was one of the first to summarise the associations between climatic variation and animal colouration, noting in particular that birds and mammals seemed more pigmented in tropical regions. The term 'Gloger's rule' was coined by B. Rensch in 1929 and included different patterns of variation from those described by Gloger. Rensch defined the rule in two ways: a simple version stating that endothermic animals are predicted to be darker in warmer and humid areas due to the increased deposition of melanin pigments; and a complex version that includes the differential effects of humidity and temperature on both main types of melanin pigments - eu- and phaeo-melanin. The blackish eu-melanins are predicted to increase with humidity, and decrease only at extreme low temperatures, while the brown-yellowish phaeomelanins prevail in dry and warm regions and decrease rapidly with lower temperatures. A survey of the literature indicates that there is considerable variation/confusion in the way Gloger's rule is understood (based on 271 studies that define the rule). Whereas the complex version is hardly mentioned, only a quarter of the definitions are consistent with the simple version of Gloger's rule (darker where warm and wet), and most definitions mention only the effects of humidity (darker where wet). A smaller subset of studies define the rule based on other correlated climatic and environmental variables such as vegetation, latitude, altitude, solar radiation, etc., and a few even contradict the original definition (darker where cold). Based on the literature survey, I synthesised the qualitative (N = 124 studies) and quantitative (meta-analytically, N = 38 studies, 241 effects) evidence testing the simple version of Gloger's rule (I found no tests of the complex version). Both lines of evidence supported the predicted effects of humidity (and closely linked variables) on colour variation, but not the effects of temperature. Moreover, humidity effects are not restricted to birds and mammals, as the data indicate that these effects also apply to insects. This suggests that the simple version of Gloger's rule as originally defined may not be valid, and possibly that the rule should be re-formulated in terms of humidity effects only. I suggest, however, that more data are needed before such a reformulation, due to potential publication biases. In conclusion, I recommend that authors cite Rensch when referring to Gloger's rule and that they make clear which version they are referring to. Future research should concentrate on rigorously testing the validity and generality of both versions of Gloger's rule and establishing the mechanism(s) responsible for the patterns it describes. Since humidity seems to be the core climatic variable behind Gloger's rule, I suggest that the two most plausible mechanisms are camouflage and protection against parasites/pathogens, the latter possibly through pleiotropic effects on the immune system. Understanding the processes that lead to climatic effects on animal colouration may provide insights into past and future patterns of adaptation to climatic change.",2019.0,WILEY,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,"A review of Gloger's rule, an ecogeographical rule of colour: definitions, interpretations and evidence",Biology,Kaspar,Kaspar,0.0,0.0

Additionally, communities near water bodies are more responsive to potential flood hazards by avoiding residence in flood zones than inland communities. At the national scale, economically disadvantaged population are more likely to reside in flood zones than outside. At the local scale, economically disadvantaged population tend to reside in flood zones in inland areas, while coastal flood zones are more occupied by wealthier and elderly people. These findings point to an alarming situation of inland communities where people are generally less responsive to flood hazards and people in flood zones are in a lower economic condition.

The computer climate models adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), such as the General Circulation Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), projected that the global surface temperature could rise more than 1.5 degrees C by 2030 and more than 4-5 degrees C by 2100 relative to the pre-industrial period (1850-1900) because of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. These computer projections are being used to justify expensive mitigation policies to drastically reduce CO2 emissions due to the use of fossil fuel. However, these models must be validated before their interpretation of climate change could be considered reliable. Herein, I summarize recent scientific research pointing out that these GCMs fail to properly reconstruct the natural variability of the climate throughout the entire Holocene and at multiple time scales such as: (1) the Holocene Climatic Optimum (9000-6000 years ago) with the subsequent cooling from 5000 years ago to now, (2) the large millennial oscillations observed throughout the Holocene that were responsible, for example, for the Medieval Wann Period; (3) several shorter climatic oscillations with periods of about 9.1, 10.4, 20, 60 years; (4) the climate change trend after 2000 to date, which the models greatly overestimate; and many other patterns. These different pieces of evidence imply two main facts: (1) the models' equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) to radiative forcing, such as to an atmospheric CO2 doubling, is overestimated at least by a factor of 2, which implies a more realistic ECS between 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C; (2) there area number of solar and astronomical forcings that are still missing in the models or are poorly understood yet. Consequently, these GCMs are not physically reliable for properly interpreting past and future climatic changes. Alternatively, semi-empirical climatic models should be used. Data analysis found that the climatic natural variability is made of several oscillations from the decadal to the millennial scales (e.g. periods of about 9.1, 10.4, 20, 60, 115, 1000 years) and others. These oscillations are coherent with solar, lunar and astronomical oscillations. A semi-empirical climate model that makes use of these oscillations plus a reduced ECS reconstructs with great accuracy the climate variability observed since 1850 and projects a very moderate warming until 2040 and a warming lower than 2 degrees C from 2000 to 2100 using the same anthropogenic emission scenarios used for the 21st-century climate simulations of the CMIP5 models. This result suggests that climatic adaptation policies, which are far less expensive than the mitigation ones, could be sufficient to address the consequences of climatic changes that could occur during the 21st century.",2019.0,UNIV STUDI ROMA LA SAPIENZA,Geology,ON THE RELIABILITY OF COMPUTER-BASED CLIMATE MODELS,Earth sciences,Nicola,Nicola,0.8333333333333334,1.0

We develop a static CGE model, which zooms into one single period of a standard Auerbach-Kotlikoff model. While we observe private and instantaneous adaptation in reaction to price changes, we explicitly model public adaptation funded by taxing either labor or capital. We apply our model to heat waves in Switzerland and are able to show that heat waves affect cohort's utility in an unadapted economy in substantially different ways. While young and less vulnerable cohorts profit (in welfare terms and because of inheritance) from heat waves, vulnerable but surviving cohort's welfare decreases substantially. Thus, without adaptation, vulnerable cohorts are worse off and might have even fewer possibilities to invest in private adaptation in the long run. Overall, we show that with adaptation, the negative impact of a 2003-like heat wave on output can be reduced from about - 0.5% of GDP to - 0.04% of GDP.

The differentiated powers of two coalitions to some extent leave the agenda of climate migration in the policy domain as a subject of informal institutional capacity rather than a formal regulatory framework. Consequently, the evolution of the policy environment for climate migration depends on how effectively a greater policy space is determined by narratives, coalitions and power.

This article evaluates the feasibility of double cropping, which has received relatively little consideration yet holds potential as an adaptation strategy. To assess its feasibility, growing seasons and economic profitability as calculated from crop yield and quality are considered. Accordingly, methods are developed for quantifying the determinants of crop yield and quality grade in a simultaneous equation system that directly expresses the ordered and fractional nature of grade shares. An empirical application to rice and wheat production in Japan reveals that, without any adaptation strategy, climate change will decrease revenues of both crops due to the reduction in yield and quality. Adjusting planting dates helps to avoid such negative impacts for rice but not enough for wheat in southern Japan. However, climate change provides an opportunity for another adaptation strategy-double cropping. Warmer climates enable many regions to shift from a single cropping system to a rice-wheat double cropping system by shortening the length of the wheat growing season and by delaying the optimal timing of rice planting. As a consequence, the area suitable for double cropping is nearly tripled, suggesting a strong potential to offset climate-induced production and profit losses.",2019.0,WILEY,Agriculture,TWO HARVESTS ARE BETTER THAN ONE: DOUBLE CROPPING AS A STRATEGY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION,Agriculture,Kentaro,Kentaro,0.0,0.0

Interviews with 44 house owners in four regions exposed to climate risks in Sweden were analyzed using the narrative method.

The results indicate that narrators do risk in different ways in relation to the master narratives of the climate threat and individual environmental responsibility, which dominate the official rhetoric in Sweden. Three risk narratives are revealed in the interviews: (1) the master narrative of 'the responsible house owner,' (2) the alternative narrative of 'the vulnerable house owner', and (3) the counter-narrative of 'the safe house owner.' The climate risks talked about could relate to the narrator's own house or to risks at a local or global level. The results indicate that different intersections of class, gender, age, and place shape different ways of positioning in relation to risk, by describing oneself as more or less aware of and exposed to climate risks. The analysis also reveals that different intersections of social structures lead to shifting prerequisites for house-owner preparedness towards preventing and managing climate risks.

Results are based on a systematic comparison of investment decisions of 40 Dutch municipalities (about 10% of the population). Findings show that: 1) the extent to which municipalities anticipate the future differs largely; 2) only half of the municipalities adopt a long time perspective; 3) there are no commonly applied robustness tests; 4) flexibility is not explicitly adopted; rather, different flexible measures are applied; and 5) a minority of municipalities develop strategic visions or scenarios for urban water management to support decisions.

Because wave energy converters are designed to survive rough seas and can be transported by sea, they could potentially play a role in poststorm operations and contribute to power-grid recovery. To that end, this paper addresses questions such as how many devices would need to be deployed and in what sequence, in order to optimize some performance index that includes, as functions of time, both, the energy needed and the energy converted by the device units. In this work, the wave-by-wave dynamics of the devices are controlled to optimize mean power conversion over 20min, assuming sea-state stationarity over that period. Sea-state variations between 20min and 13h are found to be small (relative to variations between 13 and 60h) for a candidate deployment site near a Caribbean island. Targeting deployment over 5-7days, two optimization schemes are considered: (i) maximization of the power conversion capacity over a specified time interval and (ii) minimization of the time taken to deploy the desired conversion capacity. With the wave energy devices controlled for optimal conversion over successive 20-min periods, the optimization is carried out over the number of converter units added as a function of time. The results indicate that optimal deployment sequences can be evaluated for given conversion capacity/recovery-time targets and the type of recovery desired [strategies (i) or (ii) above]. However, depending on the energy richness of the normal wave climate at the deployment site, cost-effective recovery may require closer consideration of the trade-offs among device configurations, size, and number of units needed for desired capacity. The potential for wave energy devices to power early recovery operations and to support power-grid black-start could be worth considering further as a means to enhance the resilience of coastal and island energy systems.",2019.0,AMER INST PHYSICS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Enhancing the resilience of energy systems: Optimal deployment of wave energy devices following coastal storms,Interdisciplinary,Umesh A.,Umesh,0.0,0.0

Through analysing the contradictions inherent in framings of certain bodies and spaces as being 'of risk' or 'at risk' over others, I argue that the epistemologies of modernity, disaster risk and resilience endorsed and propagated by the state are facilitating processes of displacement and dispossession that serve elite commercial interests under the auspices of disaster resilience and pro-poor development.",2019.0,WILEY,Area Studies,"Worlding aspirations and resilient futures: Framings of risk and contemporary city-making in Metro Cebu, the Philippines",Interdisciplinary,Jordana,Jordana,0.75,1.0

The most widely used approach is the ""coral gardening"" tenet; an active reef restoration tactic based on principles, concepts, and theories used in silviculture. During the relatively short period since its inception, the gardening approach has been tested globally in a wide range of reef sites, and on about 100 coral species, utilizing hundreds of thousands of nursery-raised coral colonies. While still lacking credibility for simulating restoration scenarios under forecasted climate change impacts, and with a limited adaptation toolkit used in the gardening approach, it is still deficient. Therefore, novel restoration avenues have recently been suggested and devised, and some have already been tested, primarily in the laboratory. Here, I describe seven classes of such novel avenues and tools, which include the improved gardening methodologies, ecological engineering approaches, assisted migration/colonization, assisted genetics/evolution, assisted microbiome, coral epigenetics, and coral chimerism. These are further classified into three operation levels, each dependent on the success of the former level.

According to the FAO, CSA explicitly aims for three objectives: (1) to sustainably increase agricultural productivity to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security and development; (2) to adapt and build resilience to climate change at multiple levels; and (3) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. This definition of CSA is central to ongoing debates between different groups of stakeholders, such as NGOs and policy-makers in developed and developing countries, over what exactly constitutes CSA, e.g. does it encompass large-scale industrial agriculture and small-scale agriculture, organic and non-organic farming practices, and which associated practices fall in its ambit. Thus, to frame CSA's efficacy for the future, it is important to explore how different groups of stakeholders define CSA. This study collects and analyses data from qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 30 active members of the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA)-one of the most prominent organizations currently involved in shaping CSA policy. The interviewees include employees of governments, NGOs, research institutions, agribusiness companies and representatives of farmers' groups. Their responses reveal that for CSA practitioners within GACSA, doing CSA is perceived to be significantly more important than defining CSA or attempting to identify the differences between, for example, agroecology and CSA. Particularly challenging is to define what qualifies as ""smart"". Nevertheless, clarification of CSA is important for governments and policy-makers, in particular with regard to the use of inorganic fertilizers and GM technologies. Although these latter approaches are not explicitly promoted by GACSA, the membership of several ""Big Ag"" companies in the Alliance attracts criticism concerning the shaping of CSA's agenda and possible ""greenwashing"" by private interests. At the same time, the respondents note that some proponents of agroecology can be accused of ""claiming the space as their own."" Almost all interviewees stress the importance of a bottom-up approach based on shared governance and growth and placing farmers' needs first, rather than creating division among stakeholder groups. In addition, cooperation between farmers, researchers, and policymakers, as well as a context-specific approach to collaborative, data-driven education programmes are all cited as crucial for the future development of CSA.",2019.0,KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH,Food Science & Technology,What climate-smart agriculture means to members of the Global Alliance for climate-smart agriculture,Agriculture,Shinnola,Shinnola,,

The concept of climate-smart agriculture is based on the premise that it is possible to ensure production meets the needs of farmers while adapting to and mitigating climate change. CSA refers to agricultural systems that increase food security in the face of climate change, enhance adaptive capacity of farmers to the impacts of climate change, and mitigate climate change where possible.

In this context, practitioners, and academics in the field of coastal flood and erosion risk reduction have been highlighting the flood protection value of natural coastal features for some time. Examples of the implementation of nature-based coastal flood and erosion risk reduction schemes, however, are few and far between and can certainly not (yet) be considered mainstream. One key problem around the implementation of these types of approaches has arguably been the relative lack of perceived scientific certainty around the efficiency with which natural landforms, such as coastal wetlands, reduce wave action on landward lying structures and the persistence of such landforms in an uncertain future. This makes nature-inclusive approaches less attractive to more traditional engineering-only approaches that rely solely on one ""hard"" structure with a well-defined impact on waves and a specified design life. Using the example of wave dissipation over coastal wetland surfaces, this paper provides a way forward for an easily applicable scientifically informed assessment of the minimum difference any given wetland makes to wave heights at landward locations. Such a ""minimum function"" approach could be rolled out to other ecosystem services provided by natural features and thus allow decision makers and coastal planners to consider nature-inclusive approaches to coastal management with greater confidence.",2019.0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Applying Uncertain Science to Nature-Based Coastal Protection: Lessons From Shallow Wetland-Dominated Shores,Environmental studies & forestry,Iris,Iris,1.0,1.0

Through systematic qualitative analysis of interviews and discussions, the researcher found that participants from different locations in the same municipality understood warning information differently, based on unique epistemological frames. While local government framed people as deficient in knowledge, the citizens actually called upon their previous experiences with storms in order to make evacuation decisions. However, they could not project worse scenarios from previous experience and needed a phenomenon to match an experience in real time before making an evacuation decision. These findings imply that disaster imagination, disaster memory, and disaster knowledge are all distinct concepts, and future research should examine how specific contexts frame risk.

Drawing upon interview evidence obtained from a study of three rural communities in Scotland, UK, the article explores how variation in length of residence amongst community members affects abilities to cope during periods of extreme weather, with longterm residence being associated with more positive outcomes than more recent in -migration. The article suggests that differences in responses between long-term residents and more recent in -migrants results from a complex array of differences in exposure to previous storm events, differences in occupational backgrounds that result in differences in ways of relating to the land, and differences in social relationship preferences and expectations.

In their present form, Scottish Community Resilience initiatives are likely to be limited in their ability to improve the storm -coping abilities of residents because their implementation at the whole -community scale reflects outdated assumptions about the character of rural communities and ignores the impacts of several decades of demographic change.

This article is based on a case study of an innovative land swap program developed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina by a nonprofit housing organization, Project Home Again (PHA). PHA's land swap program concentrated redevelopment during a time of uncertain population return and expanded resettlement options for nearly 100 low- and moderate-income households devastated by Hurricane Katrina's floodwaters. I describe the operation of PHA's land swap program and identify three conditions that can increase the viability and impact of land swaps in other disaster recovery settings: the incorporation of land swaps into housing recovery policy; cross-sector collaboration in the implementation of land swaps; and coordination with public or quasi-public land banks. Takeaway for practice: Land swaps can be a useful tool in disaster recovery by helping to guide redevelopment while expanding resettlement options for displaced residents.

Some of these adaptations will likely benefit certain property owners and communities at the expense of others. For example, seawalls intended to save valuable parcels of land from sea-level rise could wind up forcing seawater onto neighboring parcels that would not have flooded otherwise. One day in the not-too-distant future, societies will have to grapple with the question of whether the government is responsible for harms it causes in its attempts to save livelihoods and land threatened by climate change. This Note seeks to address that question by analyzing the extent to which a government in the United States would face takings liability if its adaptive measures to address sea-level rise-one of the most salient property harms that will result from climate change-save certain parcels but harm others.

Despite living in diverse contexts, Indigenous peoples face a number of common challenges. Disproportionate threats from climate change exist due to a range of factors including unique relationships with the natural environment, socioeconomic deprivation, a greater existing burden of disease, poorer access to and quality of health care, and political marginalization. Responses to climate change at global, national, and local levels also threaten Indigenous people's rights. While climate action presents many opportunities to improve health and reduce inequities, there is also significant potential for climate mitigation and adaptation policies to inflict harm on Indigenous peoples. An important aspect of this is the impact on traditional lands, which are acknowledged as a fundamental determinant of Indigenous health and well-being. This article seeks to elucidate the relationships between climate change and Indigenous health and to inform health promotion solutions to achieve climate justice for Indigenous peoples. The underpinning analysis is founded on a Kaupapa Maori positioning, which seeks transformative change and involves critiquing Western knowledges and structures that undermine Indigenous rights. A central theme is that anthropogenic climate change is intimately connected to the ideologies, systems and practices of colonialism, and that the impacts on Indigenous peoples can be conceptualized as an intensification of the process of colonization. It is not possible to understand and address climate-related health impacts for Indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression, marginalization and dispossession. The challenge for health promotion is to engage in a process of decolonization. This involves deconstructing its own systems and practices to avoid reinforcing colonialism and perpetuating inequities. It also requires health promotion practitioners to support Indigenous self-determination and recognize Indigenous knowledges as a critical foundation for climate change and health solutions.",2019.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Climate change and Indigenous Health Promotion,Medicine,Rhys,Rhys,0.0,0.0

This article explores this insistence and the desire(s) for there to be a reified relation between climate and migration such insistence reveals. The article proceeds in three movements. First, it situates discourses on climate migration in relation to the crisis of humanism the Anthropocene signifies. Second, it operates a symptomatic reading of climate migration discourses, drawing on two understandings of symptom elaborated by Lacan - as 'return of the repressed' and as 'Sinthome'. Read as a symptom, the figure of the climate migrant/refugee appears as the return of fundamental contradictions that carve contemporary regimes of socioecological (re)production. Through the concept of 'Sinthome', discourses on climate migration can be read as (illusory) attempts to shore up for the waning consistence of modern forms of 'being human'. Finally, the article proposes a symptomatic reading of the Anthropocene itself, and elaborates on what the dissolution of this symptom/ Sinthome would entail.""",2019.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Geography,And yet it moves!

It assesses Climate Change vulnerability and adaptation options for mangroves in West Africa. West African mangroves contribute a wide range of environmental services, economic goods and social services. In spite of the important contributions of mangroves in the region, they experiencing high rate of degradation. It is estimated that the degradation and the deforestation of mangroves in the region have resulted from their uncontrolled anthropogenic exploitation due to urbanisation, population growth, salt production, industrial pollution and the cutting of mangroves for firewood. Besides the afore-mentioned anthropogenic impacts on the mangroves, the anticipated effects of climate change such as increased temperatures, sea level rise, increased intensity of storm and precipitation are likely to have the most severe impacts on mangrove ecosystems. Climate change and the anthropogenic driven variations of these environmental forces will inevitably have a profound effect on coastal zones and mangroves. The challenge of reversing the degradation of mangrove ecosystems in the face of uncontrolled exploitation and impacts of climate change seems to be a very complex problem. This assessment has identified that both the past and the present vulnerability were more controlled by anthropogenic activities than the effects of climate change, though it is expected that climate change may be the major driving force in the long-term. However, many adaptation options exist to enhance specific ecosystem services in ways that reduce negative trade-offs, but these involve changes in policies, institutional framework and better practices for exploitation, and good management strategies. The chapter concludes that West Africa should implement adaptation policy options including reducing anthropogenic impacts, maintaining coastal buffer zones, restoration of mangroves, catchment management, establishing regional monitoring and regulations and education and local participation to enhance sustainability.",2018.0,,nan,An Assessment of Vulnerability and Adaptation of Coastal Mangroves of West Africa in the Face of Climate Change,Unknown,Isaac,Isaac,0.0,0.0

At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the tourist town of Calpe (Alicante, Spain) on 12 October 2007. Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by small basins in the Mediterranean following intense rainfall events that may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here, we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of 500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations that have taken place along the Mediterranean coast. The expansion of urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The municipal area recognised as presenting a class ""2"" qualitative vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable) rose from 1% to 34% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to just 0.7 ha in 2002. The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins. It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations required.

Historically, Ibadan City began on hilltop locations for security reasons and grew rapidly down the slopes and flood plains adjoining the hills. With this varied topography and the heightened tempo of urbanisation with its attendant hydrological consequences in this region of relatively heavy annual torrential rainfall, have come flood problems that devastate the city on a more or less annual basis. The flood occurrence lag, the topographical opposites, environmental impact of urbanisation and the cultural context in which all these occur provide an interesting test-case for studies in flooding. The present study used a combined method of hydrological and socio-economic inquiry to investigate flood problems of the city of Ibadan. Specifically, it used rainfall data, historical reconstruction of land use by means of air photo interpretation among others, and runoff prediction by means of curve numbers (CN) to understand the flood-problem of the urbanising watershed. The effects of the floods were captured through questionnaires and interview schedules with various users of the flood plain, city planners and other relevant professionals. Flood frequency, magnitude and hazards that wasted the city in terms of human, property and biodiversity losses increased with increasing conversion of land from the more compatible forestry use to urban uses. For example, such uses as residential, industrial, institutional and recreational, and infrastructural development (e.g. roads) make soil surface impervious and generate much runoff. It was also found that the flood problem in the city has been worsened by flood plain encroachment by residential development and businesses, poor spacing of houses, careless and uncontrolled refuse dumping and widespread poverty that make people inhabit flood-prone areas. It is recommended that the seriousness and complexity of the flood problem in the city require an integrated approach that attacks the root causes of hazard proneness of the victims as well as addresses both the cultural habits that promote flood hazards and the effects they cause. Such an approach requires the co-operation of the individual victims or users of the flood-prone zones, estate developers and the government to control the flood hazard of the city. It also requires improvement in weather services, especially flood warnings that will help to reduce hazard from floods.",1999.0,ACADEMY SCIENCE PUBLISHERS,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Land use and misuse and the Ibadan flood problems: 1955-1980,Interdisciplinary,JO,JO,,

The main cause of the flooding problem is the instantaneous extreme high rainfall events that often exceed the drainage capacity of She-Zih. Current solutions to relieve this water hazard, suggested by the Water Resources Agency, include channel widening and many water pumping installations. At present, all emergency facilities are insufficient to combat unexpected heavy storms. Therefore, this study attempts to design drainage systems using the available limited land space, along with rainwater catchment systems, in order to achieve the expected flood prevention goal. These study results may provide adequate references for residents and government agencies to design future flood prevention management plans and strategies. This study gathers information from previous literatures to understand initially the effect of storm runoff in this low-lying area, the flood mitigation benefits of building rooftop catchment systems and the drainage systems. Scaled-down rooftop simulation experiments are then conducted with different rainfall intensities and retention rates to evaluate their effects on flood mitigation.

The Everglades are no longer a free-flowing wetland ecosystem, but are now subject to a complicated system of water management that is regulated primarily for flood control and consumptive use. Attempts to restore a more natural hydropattern to the remaining undeveloped Everglades are made more difficult by the natural extremes in rainfall, flat landscape, highly porous geology, and inaccessibility of the remaining natural areas. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) seeks ecosystem restoration by adding water storage capacity, reducing groundwater seepage, improving regulatory delivery and timing of water to avoid environmental damage, and where feasible, improving the quality of water to be used for Everglades restoration. Water quality issues that currently exist for south Florida include eutrophication (especially phosphorus), mercury, and contaminants from agricultural production and the urban environment. Lands once in agricultural production that will be converted back to wetlands or will become reservoirs may contribute to the water quality concerns.

The search was limited to the English language and epidemiologic studies. Studies that reported mortality counts or excess deaths following heat waves were excluded so that the focus remained on general ambient temperature and mortality in a variety of locations. Studies focusing on cold temperature effects were also excluded. Results: Thirty-six total studies were presented in three tables: 1) elevated ambient temperature and mortality; 2) air pollutants as confounders and/or effect modifiers of the elevated ambient temperature and mortality association; and 3) vulnerable subgroups of the elevated ambient temperature-mortality association. The evidence suggests that particulate matter with less than 10 um in aerodynamic diameter and ozone may confound the association, while ozone was an effect modifier in the warmer months in some locations. Nonetheless, the independent effect of temperature and mortality was withheld. Elevated temperature was associated with increased risk for those dying from cardiovascular, respiratory, cerebrovascular, and some specific cardiovascular diseases, such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Vulnerable subgroups also included: Black racial/ethnic group, women, those with lower socioeconomic status, and several age groups, particularly the elderly over 65 years of age as well as infants and young children.

In order to determine if rainfall at nine candidate stations in the metropolitan area was influenced by changes in particulate concentrations within the 1948-2009 period, predicted rainfall characteristics were derived from rainfall frequencies at nine reference stations located more than 80 km from downtown Atlanta. Both parametric and non-parametric tests were used to test for significant differences between observed values and predicted values within 34 overlapping 30-year periods. For the country as a whole, emissions of PM10 (i.e. particulates with a diameter less than or equal to 10 mu m) decreased by approximately 40% from 1970 to 1975. The reduction in emissions caused a rapid rebound in summer rainfall in the Atlanta region. There was suppression of rainfall over and downwind of the Atlanta urbanized area during 30-yr periods that comprise all or portions of the decades of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. This suppression occurred even while urban-related factors that promote rainfall enhancement were present. During the 1948-1977 suppression period, there was a decrease in rainfall of at least 40 mm at affected locales, which is substantial given that the mean seasonal rainfall was approximately 300 mm. The rainfall suppression involved a decrease of heavy-rainfall days.

Sustainable adaptation to sea-level rise has been a growing concern for coastal management authorities, engineers, ecologists, urban planners and designers. A shift from 'coastal armoring' and hard engineered 'defense systems', to ecologically informed infrastructures has created opportunities and challenges in designing structures that can perform beyond engineering goals and provide ecological and social benefits. Emerging studies determine the importance of ecological knowledge and landscape-based solutions in informing the design of coastal infrastructures; however, there are limited number of projects that demonstrate the most effective design approaches. This paper reviews existing and emerging projects that propose modified coastal structures including bioengineered breakwaters and living shorelines with natural and nature-based features that have multiple benefits such as reducing flood risks and mitigating the loss of intertidal and shallow water biodiversity. Two case studies of coastal management projects in the U.S. and Singapore are investigated, which take a 'design by research' approach through testing innovative approaches to achieve multiple benefits. Opportunities and challenges associated with the design and construction of coastal structures with different levels of integrating landscape-based solutions are identified across projects, and guidelines for the design and construction industry are provided.

The area is vulnerable to natural hazards such as landslides, coastal and cliff erosion and wave-induced erosion. However, there is a dearth of consistent data on the state of the environment, the level of social vulnerability and the socioeconomic status of the town's residents. This research bridges the gap in knowledge by identifying the intensity of Barton on Sea's social vulnerability in current scenarios. Accordingly, a Social Vulnerability Survey experiment (n = 72) was carried out in 2017. The survey results showed that natural hazards, particularly coastal and cliff erosion, have a negligible impact on people's income. Home insurance can be acquired for the majority of coastal properties without much difficulty. This research also revealed that social vulnerability is not necessarily associated with social inequality in all environmental and geographical circumstances, and no substantial evidence was found that economic inequality increases vulnerability to natural hazards. The communities of Barton on Sea are happy even though they frequently experience the effects of natural hazards. This study provides vital data about the socioeconomic life of the Barton on Sea population that is invaluable for decision-makers' recognition of coastal areas that require intervention, and that can guide policy measures to reduce the risk and intensity of natural hazards in order to protect the coastal frontage in the future.",2019.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Geology,"Evaluation of social vulnerability to natural hazards: a case of Barton on Sea, England",Earth sciences,Komali,Komali,,

Therefore, this research explores how disaster empowers or disempowers stakeholders by investigating the interdependence of social relations in post-disaster natural resource management. After the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, the island of Koh Klang demonstrated resilience in restoring its ecosystem.

The findings show that after a disaster, natural resources and embedded social norms form the basis for a resilient community. Using community- and ecosystem-based methods fosters a community's environmental and social resilience and prepares it to respond to future disasters.

Using process-tracing and progressive contextualization methods, this paper shows the diversity of feedbacks that shape indebtedness and provides examples of social-ecological consequences. Unpacking these consequences in individual cases demonstrates indebtedness as an important root cause of vulnerability, which is in contrast to an examination of proximate causes, such as credit policy or temperature, that is the focus of a large share of scholarship. The paper shows that different credit sources are associated with different sets of obligations, leading to varied livelihood and agricultural consequences.

However, these changes to governance needed to foster ecosystem resilience will not be adopted by democratic societies without careful attention to their effect on the social system itself.

The outcomes show that cruise traffic depends on the sea ice cover, but only to some extent. Other factors, such as a location's attractiveness or sailing regulations also influence cruise itineraries around Svalbard. Sea ice conditions are in general considered favorable for cruising around Svalbard, and sea ice is a not a decisive factor in cruise planning and organization. The sea ice cover around Svalbard is decreasing; thus, high annual and inter-annual unpredictability of sea ice poses challenges for cruise operations around Svalbard.

Building codes, regulations, directives, and design guidelines have primarily focused on a building's performance-particularly on energy performance. Meanwhile, there is increasing interest in the co-benefits of a building's energy efficiency, such as human health and water conservation, which are less addressed in building performance assessments. To respond to these critics and the research gap in the current energy-centric building performance assessment framework, this paper presents a methodological framework to assess a building's impact on energy, environment (smog, global warming, ozone depletion), water (acidification, eutrophication) and human health. This integrated assessment framework is based on life cycle assessment (LCA) and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The aim of this proposed framework is to: (1) shift the mindset from performance to impact when assessing building design solutions; (2) provide a broader building assessment framework that integrates energy, water, the environment, and health; and (3) demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed integrated assessment framework. This paper first outlines the two missing components of the current net zero energy building assessment method, followed by a description of other building impacts that should be included in building. More precisely, three additional impact categories were identified: the environment, water, and human health. Within each impact category, multiple impact criteria were included. Then, a multi-criteria analysis was applied to rank the design alternatives. Lastly, a case study was used to demonstrate the validity of this proposed framework, the original building and three alternatives were evaluated. The results show current single criteria (energy-centric) approach is not adequate since 3 different alternatives performed differently in variety impact categories. In general, design alternatives with low-impact materials generate less human health impact, while not always correlate with life cycle energy saving. The findings approved that the proposed assessment framework can be applied to the whole building as well as to individual building components or assemblies.",2019.0,ELSEVIER,Engineering,Building impact assessment-A combined life cycle assessment and multi criteria decision analysis framework,Engineering & technology,Ming,Ming,0.25,0.0

For this purpose, linear and nonlinear metabolic grey models are combined with the optimization technique to obtain more accurate forecasting results. Optimization technique provides estimation of the parameters in metabolic grey model (MGM(1,1)) and nonlinear metabolic grey model (NMGM(1,1)). In this study, MGM(1,1), NMGM(1,1), optimized metabolic grey model OMGM(1,1), and optimized nonlinear metabolic grey model (ONMGM(1,1)) are applied for prediction of Turkey's GHG emissions including the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), excluding LULUCF and from the energy sector. The ONMGM(1,1) gives more accurate results than the others from 1995 to 2016. The MAPE values of the ONMGM(1,1) are 4.80%, 4.14% and 5.19% for Turkey's GHG emissions with LULUCF, without LULUCF and from the energy sector, respectively. On the other hand, results of the ONMGM(1,1) show that the annual growth rates are forecasted as 0.56%, 0.66% and 0.49% for Turkey's GHG emissions with LULUCF, without LULUCF and from the energy sector, respectively, from 2017 to 2025. Furthermore, Turkey's highest GHG emissions with LULUCF, without LULUCF and from the energy sector are estimated by MGM(1,1) as 606.9 Mt of CO2 equivalent, 726.4 Mt of CO2 equivalent and 585.2 Mt of CO2 equivalent in 2025, respectively. According to Turkey's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), target of its GHG emissions including LULUCF is estimated as 934 Mt of CO2 equivalent in a Business-As-Usual scenario and 790 Mt of CO2 equivalent in a Mitigation scenario for the year 2025. Therefore, this study presents lower values of Turkey's GHG emissions with LULUCF than the values of Turkey's INDC for the year 2025. Additionally, results of this study present that energy sector has the largest share of Turkey's GHG emissions from 2017 to 2025. Therefore, Turkish Government should develop policies to use energy more efficiently and to increase the capacity of renewable energy sources in electricity generation. Especially, Turkey's ambition to increase the share of renewable energy in total is very assertive. This can be seen from the Turkey's 11th Development Plan.

In the analyses, afforestation targets for bare forest lands, tree species, carbon prices, planning approaches and sets of various targets and constraints on carbon dynamics were evaluated. The results were based on twenty-five forest management scenarios formulated for the Korucu Forest Planning Unit of Turkey. The results showed that, compared to timber-based planning strategies (TM), ecosystem-based planning approach (EM) contributes to a significant reduction in carbon sequestration in many cases. When different afforestation targets were incorporated into forest management strategies, cumulative carbon sequestration increased constantly compared to baseline scenario without any afforestation areas. In addition, the highest total carbon sequestration was observed when black pine (P. nigra) was used in afforestation activities rather than oak species (Quercus sp.) and other available tree species. While total timber production and timber net present value (NPV) decreased, carbon sequestration increased significantly with increasing carbon price. As a result of increasing carbon price from $20/ton to $100/ton, joint NPV increased by about five times.

At colonization, Africans were thought of as primitive although they had their own systems, contents, and methods of education. Colonialism signified the decline in the importance of indigenous knowledge systems (IKS). By shifting focus in the core curriculum from teaching/learning based on Western science to teaching/learning through IKS as a foundation for all education, it is anticipated that all forms of knowledge, ways of knowing, and world views be acknowledged as equally valid, adaptable, and complementary to one another in equally valuable ways. The uniqueness of indigenous people and their knowledge is inextricably connected to their lands, which are situated primarily at the social-ecological margins of human habitation such as tropical forests and desert margins. It is at these margins that the consequences of climate change manifest themselves in the following sectors: agriculture, pastoralism, fishing, hunting and gathering, and other subsistence activities, including access to water. Government policies in Zimbabwe often limit options and thus undermine indigenous peoples' efforts to adapt. IKS is very important for community-based adaptation and mitigation actions in the agricultural sector for maintenance of resilience of social-ecological systems at a local level.

Although the spatial coverage and length of GNSS data records continues to increase in proximity to tide gauges, large tracts of the world's coastlines contain limited or no GNSS data. Various studies have investigated proxy methods of estimating VLM by trends from differenced altimetry-tide gauge techniques (ALT-TG). This study has concentrated on investigating the utility of ALT-TG techniques using so-called 'off the shelf' gridded satellite altimetry products (U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory [NASA JPL] and Copernicus Climate Change Service [C3S]) for use in regional and local scale sea-level studies to estimate VLM. Twenty locations across the globe were analysed; these locations met specific data constraints designed to ensure the longest overlapping coverage of GNSS, altimetry, and tide gauge data, with the proximity of the GNSS record limited to within 1 km of the tide gauge. The utility of ALT-TG estimates was significantly improved by using gridded altimetry products no closer than 30 km from the open coast. When compared directly with measured GNSS solutions from NASA JPL, Systeme d'Observation du Niveau des Eaux Littorales (SONEL), and Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL), both ALT-TG VLM estimates agree with the NGL GNSS solution for 19 of the 20 locations (95% confidence interval). This is significant given that the NGL estimates are derived over the longest timeframe available from all three key GNSS data repositories considered. If one considers the limitations of altimetry sea surface height measurements in the coastal zone, the results using gridded sea surface height anomaly products for ALT-TG derived estimates of VLM are extremely encouraging for sea-level research.",2019.0,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,An Assessment of the Utility of Satellite Altimetry and Tide Gauge Data (ALT-TG) as a Proxy for Estimating Vertical Land Motion,Environmental studies & forestry,Phil J.,Phil,0.0,0.0

This information is particularly applicable to management decisions such as tillage, nutrient application, and soil and water conservation. This study evaluated the spatial variability and derived the optimal number of spatially contiguous regions of Nigeria's 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) using three soil health indicators, organic carbon (OC), bulk density (BD) and total nitrogen (TN) extracted from the Africa Soil Information Service database. Missing data were imputed using the random forest imputation method with topography and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as auxiliary variables. Using an exponential covariance function, the spatial ranges for BD, SN, and OC were calculated as 18, 42, and 60 km, respectively. These were the maximum distances at which there was no correlation between the sample data points. This finding suggests that OC has high variability across Nigeria as compared with other tested indicators. The ordinary kriging (OK) technique revealed spatial dependency (positive correlation) among TN and OC on interpolated surfaces, with high values in the southern part of the county and low values in the north. The BD values were also high in the northern regions where the soils are sandy; correspondingly, TN and OC had low values. The ""regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative clustering and partitioning"" (REDCAP) technique was used to divide LGAs into a possible number of regions while optimizing a sum of squares deviation (SSD). Optimal division was not observed in the resulting number of regional partitions. Conducting the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method on within-zone heterogeneity (WZH) revealed three partitions (two, five, and 15 regions) as optimal, in other words, there would be no significant change in WZH after three partitions. Ensuring a proper understanding of soil spatial variability and heterogeneities (or homogeneities) could facilitate agricultural planning that combines or merges state and local governments that share the same soil health properties, rather than basing decisions on geopolitical, racial, or ethnoreligious factors. The findings of this study could be applied to understand the importance of soil heterogeneities in hydrologic modeling applications.

Using archival material, geographic information system tools and ethnographic research, this study reveals how Phyang as a village is constituted by interacting ecological-technical, socio-symbolic, and bureaucratic-legal boundaries. It is observed that technologies such as land revenue records, and cadastral maps, introduced in previous processes of imperialist state formation, continue to inform water politics in this Himalayan region. It is further demonstrated how this politics is framed within the village of Phyang, but also shifts its boundaries to create the physical, discursive, and symbolic space necessary for projects like the Ice stupa to emerge. By examining the conflict through the lens of place, it is possible to identify the competing discursive frames employed by different stakeholders to legitimise their own projects for developing the arid area (or Thang) where the contested Ice stupa is located. Such an analysis allows critical water scholarship to understand both how places allow hydrosocial relationships to emerge, and how competing representations of place portray these relationships. Understanding the role of place in the constitution of hydrosocial relationships allows for a more nuanced appraisal of the challenges and opportunities inherent in negotiating development interventions aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change.

These environment changes bring us a profound change in both human production and way of life, and even lead to the collapse of a country's government with poor governance capacity. Environmental change has become a worldwide problem. Therefore, this article established a model to measure a country's fragility and the impact of climate changes on fragility, and by applying improved models intervention, plans were put forward to mitigate the risks posed to a country by climate change. To begin with, based on the improved AHP, the article proposed basic model. By using principal component analysis, the article selected the two most representative of the three main categories that affect national vulnerability respectively: safety equipment, economy, public services, population pressure precipitation and temperature. Then, the weight of each factor was figured out and the calculation formula of fragility index was got. However, weights based on expert evaluations have been found to be too subjective. Therefore, an improved model was established, which changed the parameter judgment matrix to the interval judgment matrix, thus greatly reduced the subjectivity of the model. By analyzing the top 60 countries in the 2017 Fragile Country Index, a new formula for calculating the Vulnerability Index was found, and the Fragility Assessment Interval was divided. Next, the article applied the model to specific countries to analyze how climate changes affect a country's fragility and it designed intervention programs for countries to mitigate the risks posed by climate change. Firstly, Somalia was chosen from the ten most vulnerable countries. And we drew the conclusion that Somalia's fragility index would rise year by year because of the worsening climate and might even surpass South Sudan, the most fragile country released by the Fond for Peace in 2017, becoming the theoretically most fragile country only 8 years later. Secondly, seven feasible intervention plans and the cost of implementing each intervention method was proposed.

This paper builds on the recent development of five qualitative forest sector pathways by incorporating these narratives in a multi-stage multi-model approach to analyze the quantitative impacts on the global and New Zealand forest sectors through 2100. Using assumed variations in income and population growth, wood product demand, technological change, and land use and environmental policy instruments across the different pathways over time, we estimate the changes to key sector outputs such timber prices, roundwood production, forest area, and carbon sequestration pathways. Results indicate global roundwood prices and production could increase between 0.1% and 1.3% per annum depending on the pathway, with larger variations in global forest area and carbon sequestration. Downscaling global SSP assumptions to New Zealand level reveals similar trends, especially for the SSP1 and SSP5 cases that have high economic growth and increased demand for wood products. The expectation that the country will continue to promote relatively strong land use regulations, incentivize afforestation and resulting carbon sequestration between 2015 and 2100 in all but the most pessimistic pathway (SSP3). As a result, New Zealand is likely to see at least a 50% increase in planted forests, timber production, and forest carbon sequestration over the next century. This expansion could make the country's land use sector a net greenhouse gas sink by 2030 while also reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment losses.",2019.0,NOW PUBLISHERS INC,Business & Economics,A Shared Socio-economic Pathway Approach to Assessing the Future of the New Zealand Forest Sector,Economics,Adam,Adam,0.0,0.0

Due to climate change induced sea-level rise, these defences will become exposed to higher storm surges and adaptation becomes inevitable. As an alternative to strengthening, managed retreat is discussed in literature as a coastal risk management option for climate change adaptation. Based on an evaluation of examples from the Wadden Sea, this paper elaborates managed retreat as alternative climate change adaptation from a coastal risk management perspective. This paper concludes that, conform the principles of integrated coastal zone management, one precondition for successful implementation of managed retreat is local acceptance. With respect to natural resilience to sea-level rise, managed retreat may counteract the loss of Wadden Sea structures and habitats due to coastal squeeze. However, the effectiveness depends on the surface elevation in the opened polder. If large volumes of sediment are needed to restore a natural elevation, regional resilience against SLR-induced drowning may deteriorate. With respect to coastal flood risk management in Schleswig-Holstein, opened polders have no significance as flood retention rooms and managed retreat does not reduce the hazard of flooding in surrounding polders. Further, removal of primary embankments requires large efforts to secure flood safety in adjacent polders.

Many deltas serve as major centers of agriculture, industry and commerce. The annual economic benefits derived from major deltas are often a substantial fraction of a country?s GDP. Yet, many deltas are losing land due to erosion, subsidence and subsequent flooding. Such vulnerabilities are often increased due to local land and water management decisions, relative sea-level rise, and increases in climate extremes. Aim of this review. Considerable literature exists addressing the formation of deltas and the effects of increasing urbanization, industrialization and crop and fish production, increases in relative sea level rise, and decreasing sediment deposition. This leads to the question: are the economic, environmental, ecological and social benefits derived from developed river deltas sustainable?This review focuses on this question. Methods/Design. Over 180 published documents were identified and reviewed using various search engines and key words. These key words included river deltas; delta sustainability, vulnerability, resilience, coasts, ecology, hazards, erosion, water management, urbanization, reclamation, agriculture, governance, pollution, geomorphology, economic development, socio-economic changes, and delta wetlands; relative sea level change; sediment trapping; sand mining; salinity intrusion; coastal restoration; estuarine engineering; shoreline evolution; estuarine processes; and the names of specific river basin deltas. Review Results/Synthesis and Discussion. Deltas provide humans important resources and ecosystem services leading to their intensive development. The impacts of this development, together with sea-level rise, threatens the sustainability of many river deltas. Various management and governance measures are available to help sustain deltas. Controls on land use, improved farming and transport technology, wetland habitat protection, and d improved governance are some that might help sustain the economic and ecological services provided by deltas. However, increased population growth and the impacts of climate change will put increased pressure on deltas and the benefits derived from them.",2019.0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Developed river deltas: are they sustainable?,Environmental studies & forestry,Daniel P.,Daniel,0.0,0.0

In 2014, the McKinsey-designed project was formally launched by now-disgraced President Jacob Zuma with vibrant state and corporate fanfare. Financially, its most important elements were anticipated to come from corporations promoting shipping investments and port infrastructure, a new generation of offshore oil and gas extraction projects and seabed mining However, these already conflict with underlying capitalist crisis tendencies associated with overaccumulation (overcapacity), globalization and financialization, as they played out through uneven development, commodity price volatility and excessive extraction of resources. Together this metabolic intensification of capital-nature relations can be witnessed when South Africa recently faced the Blue Economy's ecological contradictions: celebrating a massive offshore gas discovery at the same time as awareness rises about extreme coastal weather events, ocean warming and acidification (with profound threats to fast-bleaching coral reefs), sea-level rise, debilitating drought in Africa's main seaside tourist city (Cape Town), and plastic infestation of water bodies, the shoreline and vulnerable marine life. Critics of the capitalist ocean have demanded a greater state commitment to Marine Protected Areas, support for sustainable subsistence fishing and eco-tourism. But they are losing, and so more powerful resistance is needed, focusing on shifting towards post-fossil energy and transport infrastructure, agriculture and spatial planning. Given how climate change has become devastating to vulnerable coastlines - such as central Mozambique's, victim of two of the Southern Hemisphere's most intense cyclones in March-April 2019 - it is essential to better link ocean defence mechanisms to climate activism: global youth Climate Strikes and the direct action approach adopted by the likes of Dakota Access Pipe Line resistance in the US, Extinction Rebellion in Britain, and Ende Gelande in Germany. Today, as the limits to capital's crisis-displacement tactics are becoming more evident, it is the interplay of these top-down and bottom-up processes that will shape the future Blue Economy narrative, giving it either renewed legitimacy, or the kind of illegitimacy already experienced in so much South African resource-centric capitalism.",2019.0,UNIV ARIZONA LIBRARIES,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Blue Economy threats, contradictions and resistances seen from South Africa",Environmental studies & forestry,Patrick,Patrick,0.0,0.0

However, it can also lead to the unjust dislocation of the urban poor whose contributions to climate change are negligible but whose exposure to climatic risk is high. These groups of people also have little say in the decision-making about whether to retreat, when and how, thus raising concerns about equity and justice. In this paper, I examine the policy and practice of managed retreat and its environmental justice dimensions in Manila (Philippines) and Lagos (Nigeria) from 2010 to 2018. Expert interviews, focus group discussions, and policy documents were collected and analyzed for both cities. Findings reveal a complex picture of contradictions. In Lagos, retreat was stated in climate change policy but in practice only the urban poor were forcibly removed from waterfront areas and in their place new urban development projects are being constructed. In Manila, retreat was not mentioned in policy but evidence indicates informal settlers and national government offices were the target of planned retreat. Unlike Lagos, the urban poor in Manila were offered a mortgaged pathway to homeownership outside the city. However, the lack of livelihood opportunities in relocation sites engendered a cycle of retreat and return. This study further discusses how climatic uncertainties, property values, government distrust, utopian imaginaries, and environmental injustices served as barriers to managed retreat in both cities. The paper concludes with a call for an environmentally and socially just approach to retreat. It argues that the rights of the urban poor to the city must be taken into consideration even under complex climatic and socio-ecological disruptions.",2019.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Planned retreat in Global South megacities: disentangling policy, practice, and environmental justice",Environmental studies & forestry,Idowu,Idowu,0.0,0.0

Millions of babies, two thirds globally, now have milk formula, with breastfeeding in dramatic decline in Asia. Economic cost externalities and commercial incentives Economic thinking clarifies that markets are not perfect - price incentives can lead to excessive and inefficient environmental damage. Market prices paid to produce or use a commodity may not reflect its true resource costs. The ongoing global transition in infant and young child feeding (IYCF) toward milk formula use makes urgent the investigation of its environmental costs, including greenhouse gas (GHG) implications. Socially vulnerable populations are also particularly exposed to climate change risks, but have the least voice and agency. The important role of public health advocacy Few question the scale of the baby food industry, especially in major food exporting countries. Breastfeeding advocacy non-government organisations have led the investigations, and exposed the inequitable vulnerabilities. A ground-breaking study in 2016 showed emissions from just six Asia Pacific countries were equivalent to 6 billion miles of car travel. Each kilogram (kg) of milk formula generated 4 kg of (carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent) greenhouse gas during production. Much of this was from unnecessary toddler formula. Recent research reveals that if looking at the full product lifecycle, including consumer use, GHG emissions per kg are actually three times higher than these pioneering estimates. Environment and health harms combined with economic evidence highlight the place for a strong public health response on this issue. Conclusion Formula feeding is a maladaptive practice in the face of contemporary global environmental and population health challenges. Breastfeeding protection, support and promotion helps to safeguard planetary and human health by minimising environmental harm. It is a beneficial response to concerns about disease burdens and climate change. Breastfeeding populations are more resilient in emergencies.

The goal of this methodology is to produce an informed and knowledgeable construction of, which simultaneously improving continuously. Constructivists do not intend to predict and control the real world and divert it but to reconstruct the world at the point of its existence: in the mind of the people of the community in Cikarawang village.

Aspects of individual construction of hermeneutic describe as compare and contrast to the dialectical aspects of individual construction of, so that each respondent was entered into the construction of another and entirely fused. Findings The access of information on asri to face global warming is to demonstrate the hybridity and syncretism of this everyday locality and to show how this global sense of place is a progressive sense of place which avoids defensive and exclusionary definitions of place and culture because they cannot be sustained in a world where understanding a place means understanding its connection to other places. However, the youths of Cikarawang are likely to self-identify, as liberals are also more supportive of progressive domestic social agenda than older generations. They are less overtly religious than the older generations. Research limitations/implications - The access of information, is about trying to establish the existence of the collectivity by defining what makes it a community - isolating national characteristics, defining crucial historical moments or significant places. None of these implies that these meanings can be fixed. There might be useful to think of nations as projects which are never fully achieved. There are always alternative accounts which are being given, and alternative interpretations being made from different positions. Climate information needs to be made in accordance with the local context and activities of both of the content, format, timing and distribution (dissemination). Practical implications - The undetermined that perceived lack of locals trying to understand the information about weather and climate change are delivered by using technology need to engage their participation to identify and develop adaptation and mitigation strategies. Knowledge about the weather and how to overcome it is also myths about the environment containing taboo and prohibition as well as the annual harvest ritual.

Much marine aquaculture is inherently adaptable to changing climatic and chemical conditions. Nevertheless, siting of marine aquaculture operations is subject to competing environmental, economic, and social demands upon and priorities for ocean space, while some forms of marine aquaculture can also impose other externalities on marine systems, such as pollution from wastes (nutrients) and antibiotics, consumption of wild fish as food, and introduction of non-native or genetically modified species.

This article explores how the law can promote the adaptability of marine aquaculture to climate change and ocean acidification-adaptive marine aquaculture-while still preserving key rule-of-law values, such as public participation and accountability. Perhaps most obviously, law can establish substantive requirements for marine aquaculture that minimize its impacts, promoting marine resilience overall. However, to foster truly adaptive marine aquaculture, including adaptive governance institutions, coastal nations should also procedurally reform their marine spatial planning efforts to legally connect the procedures for aquaculture permitting, marine spatial planning (MSP), and adaptive management.

Crabs captured in the Jobos Bay Estuary (JBE) were studied over a 15-year period. The size (carapace width) (CW), sex, and color were documented for 1 531 crabs from 31 crab hunters. Significant temporal difference in crab size was observed (Kruskal Wallis = 46.82, P < 6.187(e-9)), the smallest crabs were captured in 2004 and the largest crabs were captured in 2013. Crab size varied by color (Kruskal Wallis = 86.54, P < 2.2e(-16)), larger crabs were blue, medium sized crabs were brown and smallest crabs were orange. Since color is related to development stage and market value, color can be used as an educational and enforcement tool. There was significant spatial difference in the size of crabs captured (Kruskal Wallis = 252.54, P < 2.2(e-16)), smaller crabs were captured in smaller hunting areas. Only three percent of crabs captured from 2009 to 2018 were below the legal-size limit. Temperature had a weak significant positive relationship with crab size and in years when rainfall was lower smaller crabs were captured. Increases in crab size from 2004 to 2013 coincided with mangrove recovery and the current decrease of crab size coincides with droughts of 2015. Management plans in the Caribbean must include local actions to reduce hunting and climate variability impacts on crab habitat and food availability.",2019.0,REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,"Long-term monitoring of crab Cardisoma guanhumi (Decapoda: Gecarcinidae) captures in Jobos Bay Estuary, Puerto Rico",Biology,Yogani,Yogani,,

Climate change and opening of shipping routes in the Arctic actualize the need to assess this type of security threats for the polar region. While the official Arctic strategies of the five coastal states - Russia, Canada, Denmark, Norway and the USA, - in general, acknowledge threats to maritime security stemming from non-state organized criminal actors, there is neither system-based understanding of these threats, differentiated approach to assessing specific types of potential maritime criminal activities, nor developing practical measures aimed at their prevention and suppression. Basing on the analysis of different maritime crimes, it seems reasonable to ascertain a generally low probability of their large-scale emergence in the Arctic in the nearest future. Main reasons for that are severe climate conditions, as well as economic and political stability of the region. However, the apparent and anticipated increase of Arctic shipping and development of new types of economic activities, such as tourism, can lead to increased risks related to transnational maritime criminal activity in the Arctic. In this regard, to date, the most real threat is posed by such crimes as terroristic attacks on cruise ships, illegal transportation of drugs and weapons using the main Arctic marine routes, illegal migration. It is obvious that the Arctic coastal states lack sufficient resources to efficiently address the threats related to transnational maritime crimes. In this context, special focus should be made on enhancing regional interstate cooperation in the field. Taking into account that the only regional mechanism responsible for enhancing coordination of national bodies regarding security-related issues is the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, it would be reasonable to endow this institution with the competence to develop joint measures for the suppression of potential maritime criminal activities in the Arctic. This could be made through development of a pan-Arctic legally binding agreement that would specify practical measures stipulated by other international agreements in the field of suppressing certain types of maritime crimes.",2019.0,NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE,International Relations,ASSESSMENT OF THREATS RELATED TO MARITIME CRIMES IN THE ARCTIC,Political science,Andrei A.,Andrei,0.0,0.0

Based on empirical field research conducted between 2014 and 2016, the study finds that local food systems have transformed from largely subsistence-oriented systems of food production and consumption to increasingly complex, multilocal networks in which off-farm livelihoods, external markets, and government-subsidized food supplies play central roles. This process of diversification of food systems has generally improved communities' resilience to food crises, despite the emergence of various new risks.

The official statements can be considered as a proxy of the participating countries' stances on DRR. As methodology, four different kinds of text mining techniques were adopted; namely, word frequency list, hierarchical cluster analysis, co-occurrence network, and correspondence analysis for the sake of quantitative content analysis. Consequently, the word frequency list showed that words such as ""development (develop)"" and ""climate change"" seemed to be distinctive of the conference focusing on DRR issues. The result of hierarchical cluster analysis seemed to imply that the participating countries, namely their governments, had appeared to be keen to implement the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR) along with their national DRR policies and to connect DRR with their development, while climate change had not been directly linked to the SFDRR and was stated as another global issue closely related to DRR. Considering that the SFDRR is closely related to the SDGs and the Paris Agreement, the observation of these contrasting results of the text mining analysis is a noteworthy finding. The result is also consistent with that of the co-occurrence network. The result of the correspondence analysis implied that the statement announced by Japan had appeared to have a characteristic feature in comparison to other statements. One possible reason for this is that there was no explicit reference to climate change, while the countries faced with disasters caused by climate change, such as those in the Pacific Islands, tended to focus on it.",2019.0,FUJI TECHNOLOGY PRESS LTD,Geology,Analysis of the Attitude Within Asia-Pacific Countries Towards Disaster Risk Reduction: Text Mining of the Official Statements of 2018 Asian Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction,Earth sciences,Daisuke,Daisuke,0.0,0.0

(2) It argues that by producing an intractable conflict and damaging the reputation of the organisations responsible for hazards management, public participation failures create formidable new barriers to transformative adaptation outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach - This research conducted semi-structured interviews with flood-affected residents, flood disaster managers and planners, and assessed land use regulations and institutional strengths to answer the research question. Findings - The results showed that the residents' anticipatory capacity to flood risks was weak and both the human and institutional resources were insufficient in coping with and responding to urban flooding. Research limitations/implications - This research has not carried out questionnaire survey of large number of residents. It is based on semi-structured interview of ten residents in two Malaysian cities. Practical implications - The insights drawn from this research would help develop flood-resilient policies for Malaysian cities. The global communities exposed to flood disasters too benefit from the Malaysia's minute but crucial human and institutional experiences in urban flooding. Social implications - Being resilient to all these small but important flood concerns has huge potential to reduce vulnerability and disaster risks and protect the lives and properties of flood affected urban residents. Originality/value The research focus in Malaysia is less on flood resilience and more on flood modeling and hydrology analysis.

As such, planners are increasingly interested in climate services. Climate services involve the expert production of forecasts, scenarios, economic analyses, and other data products to help users meaningfully address local changes and variabilities. For instance, in the US state of Louisiana, modelers tailor 50-year storm, precipitation, and sea level rise predictions to help planners select adaptive ecological restoration projects. Modelers do so by downscaling the data, combining it with other social and biophysical information, and framing results in terms of stakeholder interests. In this paper, I question what it means to develop adaptation information that is geared towards specific users and stakeholders. Given the growing recognition that adaptation planning can prove maladaptive, I ask, when do climate services actually exacerbate existing vulnerabilities? To answer, I draw on three cases from Louisiana's coastal Master Plan and highlight political economic factors informing climate services: influential stakeholders, funding dynamics, the framing of planning decisions, and differential harms and benefits. I argue that when climate data is made relevant to existing interests, budgets, and plans, it can reproduce vulnerabilities and foreclose transformative adaptation. However, marginalized stakeholders can also pressure experts to contextualize data in ways that mitigate vulnerabilities. I conclude that climate services research and practice should expand user-centered approaches by asking climate services for whom and by assessing the winners and losers from climate variability, change, and adaptation actions themselves.",2019.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Climate services for whom?

To address these gaps, this article leverages predictive modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate HAWs for biological conservation. Specifically, it builds upon prior efforts to recognize HAW ""complexes"" as Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance. Results indicate that HAWs occupy 69 430 ha in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas, with marginal, fringe, or seasonal extents expanding outward to 170 700 ha. Over 800 species are documented from these sites, including migratory birds of relevance to the Ramsar Convention. For example, species like the Black-necked Crane, Ruddy Shelduck, and Eurasian Widgeon depend on HAWs for breeding and layover. Although a third of identified HAWs occur within protected areas, those of highest conservation priority are located outside of these zones along India's trans-Himalayan frontier. Existing laws and state notifications largely support wetland conservation. However, both the Ramsar Secretariat and Government of India should further clarify legal terminology, such as the principal of ""wise use"", to ensure that parties meet Convention obligations. Future efforts are needed to systematically survey HAW biodiversity and monitor their responses to global change. (c) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Today the collision of earth system dynamics with socio-economic dynamics is shaking apart Enlightenment knowledge systems, forcing questions of what it means to be a responsible inhabitant on planet earth and how, indeed, to go onwards ""in a different mode of humanity"", to quote eco-feminist philosopher Val Plumwood (2007; Australian Humanities Review 42:1).

On the one hand, if our lifestyle causes environmental harm, then we have a duty to reduce that impact through lifestyle changes (lifestyle-matters intuition). On the other hand, many people share the intuition that environmental duties cannot demand to alter our lifestyle radically for environmental reasons. These two intuitions underlie the current dualism in the environmental duties debate: those arguing for lifestyle changes (private duties) and those arguing that our duties are limited to promoting just environmental institutions (promotional duties).

The first part examines the 'our-duties-should-be-limited' intuition. Two interpretations are discussed, one under the title 'what I do make no difference', dealing with causality and collective action, and one under the title 'my duty cannot be to change my lifestyle completely', which discusses demandingness, fairness and value conflict. The second part shows how the 'lifestyle-matters' intuition can still play an important role. This part consists of two sections, one on 'how to make a difference', which deals with the idea of a cooperative ethos, and the other with 'why lifestyle matters', discussing expressive rationality and integrity.

It develops a simple real options method to value options that are found in many climate-change adaptation contexts. This method modifies a binomial tree model frequently applied to climate-change adaptation problems, incorporating gradual learning using a Bayesian updating process driven by new observations of extreme events. It is used to investigate the timing, scale, or upgradable design of an adaptation project. Recognition that we might have more or different information in the future makes flexibility valuable. The amount of value added by flexibility and the ways in which flexibility should be exploited depend on how fast we learn about climate change. When learning will occur quickly, the value of the option to delay investment is high. When learning will occur slowly, the value of the option to build a small low-risk project instead of a large high-risk one is high. For intermediate cases, the option to build a small project that can be expanded in the future is high. The approach in this paper can support efficient decision-making on adaptation projects by anticipating that we gradually learn about climate change by the recurrence of extreme events.",2019.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Real options analysis of climate-change adaptation: investment flexibility and extreme weather events,Environmental studies & forestry,Graeme,Graeme,0.0,0.0

Those floods have a seasonal pattern that often follows the monthly mean sea level anomaly which peaks in September-October for stations between New York and south Florida. However, there are large differences between coasts: for example, over 75% of the minor floods occur during the fall in Florida, but during the spring and winter in Boston. Various data and forcing, such as tide gauge records, surface temperatures, winds, long-term tidal cycles, and the Gulf Stream flow, were analyzed to examine potential drivers and mechanisms that can contribute to the seasonal pattern of floods. The seasonal water temperature cycle, with maximum temperatures in August, could not by itself explain the seasonal sea level pattern, but two mechanisms that significantly correlate with the seasonal sea level and flooding patterns are the annual and semi-annual tidal cycles (correlation of ~ 0.97) and changes in the Gulf Stream (GS) flow (correlation of - 0.6; the GS shows a maximum decline in September-October during the period of peak flooding). The combination of the seasonal pattern of tropical storms and high coastal sea level can explain the high frequency of fall flooding along the Southeastern U.S. coasts, while winter storms have more influence on the northeastern coasts. In recent decades however, the seasonal pattern seemed to have shifted so that increased flooding is seen on the northeastern coasts during spring and summer, while in the Mid-Atlantic and southeastern coasts, a dramatic increase in flooding is seen almost exclusively during the fall. A long-term change in the mean zonal wind pattern along the coast can contribute to the recent shift in the seasonal flooding pattern.

However, because climate variability is manifesting with more extreme climate impacts, occurring with greater frequency and with more intensity, the necessity for adaptation to minimize risk is becoming more pronounced. Though this is true of coastal communities around the globe, it is an acutely important concern for coastal communities in high northern latitudes, where the impacts of climate change are occurring at a disproportionate rate. With Homer, Alaska, as a case study, and through the lens of evolutionary governance, this research investigates coastal stressors (eg. storm surges, bluff instability) and subsequent decision dynamics around local government policy and planning for climate adaptation. In particular, the paper explores the relationship between actors and institutions, the connection between power and knowledge, as well as the challenges of path and goal dependencies. Narratives from key informants associated with Homer's climate change agenda highlight that while some stakeholders are keen to mainstream adaptation thinking into long-term strategic planning, adaptation policy remains a low priority (with a focus instead on mitigation). Uptake is further hindered by a belief among key decision-makers that the threat of climate change is a concern for the future. This in turn has resulted in diminished internal capacity (eg. institutions, knowledge) to effectively prepare for climate variability in general. Drawing insights through evolutionary governance theory, this study may provide coastal community decision-makers with an appreciation of the value (and nuanced challenges) of embedding climate adaptation thinking into strategic community planning.",2020.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Coastal climate adaptation planning and evolutionary governance: Insights from Homer, Alaska",Environmental studies & forestry,S.

As a means of transcending the defense/dwelling binary, a typology of four interrelated frames are presented with which to trace localised meanings and practices of dyking as a mode of everyday governance, namely as: a) a line of defence for protective living; b) urban spectacle; c) a buffer zone or marker for land acquisition and; d) a fluid borderland, which at times ruptures the very material fixities and aqua-terrestrial distinctions upon which hard engineering infrastructural solutions are often premised.",2020.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Beyond the wall: Dyking as an object of everyday governance in the Bay of Manila, Philippines",Environmental studies & forestry,Rapti,Rapti,0.0,0.0

Indirect effects, as when antagonistic or mutualistic interactions restrict geographic range and thereby elevate extinction risk, are probably widespread and may flow in both directions, as when species- or organismic-level factors increase extinction risk or speciation probabilities. Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities. Resolution of these and other cross-level tensions presumably hinges on how organismic interactions impinge on genetic population structures, geographic ranges, and the persistence of incipient species, but generalizations are not yet possible. Paleontological and neontological data are both incomplete and so the most powerful response to these problems will require novel integrative approaches.

This paper explores the impacts of this phenomenon on farmer innovations under recurrent environmental changes. Using a case study of zai, an indigenous innovative farming practice, the paper makes two interrelated arguments. Firstly, it shows that the pervasive enclosures coerced by the Ghanaian state undermine how indigenous knowledge could be proactively deployed for climate risk management. Secondly, ISLAs produce a social barrier to climate change adaptation, as they lead to heightened uncertainty and apprehension among farmers, which affects decisions on climate risk management. More specifically, land expropriation is an example of how adaptation could be hindered by governance, institutions, and policy at the extra-local scale, including not only existing land use laws, but also the constitutional guarantee of private property.

Research has shown that SWC technologies are effective at controlling erosion and increasing yields but are labour intensive. However, the quantification of their labour impacts remains an important research gap. In this paper, I estimate the labour impacts of adopting SWC technologies in Ethiopia. Using an endogenous Switching Regression Model (ESRM), I find that adopting SWC technologies increases plot-level adult labour by 35%. Impacts on child labour depend on the number of adults in the household. Specifically, estimated impacts range from 29% for the full sample to 78% for the sub-sample of households with fewer than three adults. I also find some evidence of negative self-selection in the case of child labour, which suggests that adopters have a comparative advantage since they are able to adopt the technology with smaller impacts on child labour as a result of unobservable characteristics. The estimated labour impacts also provide a plausible explanation for why farmers may not adopt SWC technologies despite their economic profitability. Ultimately, the paper argues that understanding the heterogeneity and magnitude of the labour impacts is an important part of understanding potential trade-offs of adopting SWC technologies. Given the estimated labour impacts, policies that relax the household's labour constraints could be an effective mechanism to spur the adoption of labour-intensive environmentally agricultural practices, while minimizing potential negative effects.

Moreover, because the underlying causes of deforestation are not clearly understood, the policy options that would be most effective in halting deforestation are not known. Therefore, in this study, I examine the main factors influencing forest area change by synthesizing the results of a multinational data analysis, a Malaysian socio-economic survey, and Indonesian household surveys on deforestation that were conducted between 1990 and 2014. I reveal that poverty has a strong impact on forest area change and that high agricultural rent accelerates deforestation. I then use logical equations based on my own findings and those of previous studies to represent the relationships between deforestation, poverty, agricultural rent, and forest scarcity. From these equations, I derive clear and reasonable explanations for the causes of deforestation and assess the effectiveness of various policies and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation strategies to halt deforestation.

While much of the debate over climate and migration is centred around the Small Island Developing States in the Pacific, little is known about how the debate is articulated at that regional level. Drawing on poststructuralist discourse theory and using semi-structured interviews with a set of development actors working in the region, the paper discerns three distinctive discourses on climate and migration. These are (1) a main discourse that promotes international labour migration as an adaptation response and two alternative discourses that challenge the main discourse's views, by suggesting (2) that migration is of marginal importance and engagement with socio-economic factors that influence Pacific Islands' vulnerability is more pressing, and (3) that out-migration is undesirable but that communities may have to be relocated within their countries. The paper further explores why the discourse on labour migration may have emerged and why it is being perpetuated by actors that originate outside the Pacific region. The paper concludes by suggesting that significant differentials in economic and political resources exist between the main discourse and the alternative discourses. In addition to these empirical insights, the paper adds new findings to the growing literature on the politics of climate migration discourses.

Several animals have made the transition from the day into the night and have acquired unique adaptations to cope with the challenges of performing nocturnal activities. Several plant species have opted to bloom at night, possibly as a response to aridity to prevent excessive water loss through evapotranspiration since flowering is often a water-demanding process, or to protect pollen from heat stress. Nocturnal pollinators have visual adaptations to function under dim light conditions but may also trade off vision against olfaction when they are dependent on nectar-rewarding and scented flowers. Nocturnal pollinators may use CO2 and humidity cues emanating from freshly-opened flowers as indicators of nectar-rich resources. Some endothermic nocturnal insect pollinators are attracted to thermogenic flowers within which they remain to obtain heat as a reward to increase their energy budget. This review focuses on mechanisms that pollinators use to find flowers at night, and the signals that nocturnally blooming flowers may employ to attract pollinators under dim light conditions.

He is one of the very few finest men I have had the good fortune to interact with, during the last more than five decades of my professional life. I came in contact with Professor Sparks, way back in 1995, when he first invited me to write an invitational chapter for Advances in Agronomy, of which he is the Editor, on a revolutionary soil management technique, now globally known as ""The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept,"" summarizing my research mainly in Europe. Again, he invited me in 2011 to write another chapter on the same concept, when I had enough and meaningful data to support the concept on African and Asian soils. Ever since then, our scientific interaction has been very purposeful, and, he unhesitatingly offered his advice, when I sought it, on matters related to my profession. I consider it my good fortune to have come to know such an accomplished soil scientist, but, above all, a very remarkable and unassuming human being. It is with my deepest sense of appreciation and gratitude, that I dedicate this chapter to this remarkable scientist. Global warming is a reality man has to live with. Future food security will be dependent on a combination of the stresses, both biotic and abiotic, imposed by climate change, variability of weather within the growing season, development of cultivars more suited to different ambient conditions, and the ability to develop effective adaptation strategies which allow these cultivars to express their genetic potential under the changing climate conditions. Those plant species which are very closely related to field crops, including their progenitors, having the potential to contribute beneficial traits for crop improvement, such as, resistance to an array of biotic and abiotic stresses, enriching the gene pool, leading ultimately to enhanced plant yield, thereby aiding humanity's relentless search for production of more food to meet the ever growing needs of a burgeoning world population, are Called the ""Crop Wild Relatives""(CWRs). In fact, CWRs are known to have tremendous potential to sustain and enhance global food security, thereby contributing enormously to humanity's well-being. Therefore, their search, characterization and conservation in crop breeding programs assume great importance. Viewed against the recent upheavals in global climate change, the task becomes all the more important. Against the background of the disastrous after effects, especially the alarming environmental hazards of the highly soil extractive farming, euphemistically known as the ""green revolution,"" of the 1960s, the task assumes much cruciality.

It also aims to identify a methodological approach that allows the socio-technical perspective to be integrated into management decision-making, alongside the more typical economic appraisal methodology. Design/methodology/approach A case study and novel mixed-methodology approach is used, which applies the diffusion of innovations framework, innovation system (IS) framework and system dynamics modelling (SDM) alongside traditional economic modelling and appraisal techniques. This approach is used to assess the adoption potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) and diesel water pumping systems in the wildlife conservation sector and surrounding rural communities in Kenya. The case study approach tests the merits of the mixed-methodology approach. Findings The life-cycle costs of solar PV water pumping systems are lower in nearly all financing and utilisation scenarios; offer additional social, technical and environmental benefits; and the conditions exist for greater adoption. The use of an integrated diffusion of innovations and IS framework generates significant qualitative data that can support management decision-making. The use of SDM techniques aid conceptualisation of the community economic, water and institutional systems into which water pumps may be diffused and provide a starting point for formal SDM simulation. The results suggest that these techniques capture the socio-technical perspective well and, when used alongside traditional project appraisal approaches, produce more complete information with which to support management decision-making. Originality/value This mixed-methodology approach could be used by practitioners to increase the diffusion and adoption of RETs in more complex contexts in late-industrialising countries. The emergent theory built through the case-study approach should be tested further to assess the merits of applying these techniques to support RET management decision-making in other contexts and more broadly.",2021.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Business & Economics,Adoption of renewable energy technologies (RETs) using a mixed-method approach A case in the Kenyan conservation sector,Economics,Nicholas Morgan,Nicholas,0.0,0.0

They seek the relocation of communities due to perceptions that they are already exposed to undue levels of risk or will become exposed to high risk in the near future because of climate change. Here, we focus on the economics of managed retreats and specifically focus on the question of who pays or may pay for these relocations. Recent Findings There is a significant body of research in the other social sciences (political science, sociology, anthropology, history) on managed retreats, but almost none in economics. No paper that we are aware has focused primarily on the question of who pays for managed retreats, and the survey here therefore focusses on lessons we can learn from examples, specifically an example from New Zealand and from the little references to these questions in the existing literature. Sources of funding for managed retreats can come from the affected communities, from the public sector (the government or public insurers), and from the private sector (mostly private insurers). It is politically easier to implement managed retreats if it is the latter groups (public and private insurers) that pay, rather than placing the burden on the general taxpayer or on the affected communities themselves.",2020.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Paying a Price of Climate Change: Who Pays for Managed Retreats?,Earth sciences,Ilan,Ilan,0.0,0.0

Acclimatization is crucial for adventurous tourists, and especially for those traveling to extremely cold and highly elevated environments, when climate and weather in tourist destination differ significantly from those at home. The Acclimatization Thermal Strain Index for Tourism (ATSIT) is designed and used to measure numerically the physiological expenses a traveler pays during the acclimatization process. The purpose of the present study is to examine acclimatization consequences for travels from Beijing, capital of China, to destinations at the Arctic, the Antarctic, and the Tibetan Plateau, collectively referred to as the 3Polar regions, during the main seasons of winter and summer, and back. The results show that acclimatizing to cold involves greater physiological strain than adjustment to heat. Acclimatization load in winter is low for all travels from Beijing and back home. ATSIT projections detect the most harmful degree of discomfort for summer travels from Beijing. The greatest acclimatization impact comes when changing locales from hot and humid to cold and dry climatic conditions, which might cause high and very high physiological strain. Moreover, as many destinations in the 3Polar regions, mostly in the Tibetan Plateau, are located in mountains, a special acclimatization plan is required to weaken the threat of mountain sickness. The results will be helpful for warning stakeholders and the decision makers in the tourism sector of economies, and are expected to be translated into action for the development of proper intervention procedures in health control, to minimize population loss.",2021.0,SPRINGER,Biophysics,Adventurous tourism: acclimatization problems and decisions in trans-boundary travels,Physics,Elena A.,Elena,1.0,1.0

The research compared the actions taken by communities that had engaged in a mid- to long-term DRR program with those that had not. The DRR program prioritised disability inclusion and women's participation in, and leadership of, the community. Early warnings were widely heard across all communities but the communities that had engaged with the DRR program had greater understanding of, and trust in, the early warnings. They took earlier and more coordinated action and were safer during the cyclone. Compared with their past experiences, there was increased respect for women's voices and roles, women and men collaborated more, and people with disability were supported by the whole community. The research concludes that tropical cyclone early warnings are necessary but not sufficient to ensure there is community and household preparation.

In addressing this challenge, Tanzania has embarked on ambitious program to expand the sugar industry by establishment of new sugar estates. In view of climate change challenges, the program should be aligned to the future conditions which will have bearing on the profitability of investments. A study was conducted to assess the effect of climate change on agricultural droughts in terms of water deficit index (WDI), throughout the near-term (2010-2039) at the newly established Mkulazi II Sugar Estate at Dakawa, Mvomero District Tanzania, under two greenhouse gas emission scenarios.

Not only the Arctic Five (A5) countries, whose coasts are directly washed by the Arctic Ocean, are interested in their realization, but non-regional states also. The 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) gives them such opportunities. According to UNCLOS, the central part of the Arctic Ocean beyond the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of the Arctic countries can be considered as a high seas enclave, with all freedoms of the high seas: of navigation; of overflight; of fishing; of scientific research; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines; to construct artificial islands and other installations. The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked, which have equal rights here. In addition, it should be noted that other countries have a right to carry out certain practical activities associated with three (out of six) freedoms named above: of navigation (with some restrictions under Article 234 of UNCLOS); of overflight; freedom to lay submarine cables and pipelines - within the Arctic states EEZ. The appearance of new Arctic players interested in its spaces and resources is connected with significant increase in risks and threats, primarily non-military. This is largely due to fundamental differences between the Arctic Ocean and other sea areas, such as the Indian or Atlantic Ocean. Among these differences: only five Arctic states are washed by the Arctic Ocean's waters; shallow depth; small total area; a significant length of the shelf zone; special climate conditions, including ice cap; finally - ecological vulnerability. In this regard, the process of the Arctic region's opening for different kinds of maritime activities implementation poses a problem of the environmental security, protection and preservation of the marine environment and its biological diversity. Despite the fact that security issues in their traditional interpretation are not under the jurisdiction of the Arctic Council, its primary environmental focus indicates that these issues are directly correlated with the main area of its activities. Anyway, the modern interpretation of the ""security"" concept includes not only a ""military"", but also an ""environmental"" component. For the Arctic states, whose geographical position makes them the first victims of any environmental disaster in the region, the provision of environmental security should be the main priority in their mutual policies. The most effective model for the non-military security threats response in the Arctic is cooperation and coordination between all Arctic states at the regional level. One of the problems in the way is that the Arctic Ocean could not be compared with the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas, to which the Article 123 of the UNCLOS ""Cooperation of States Bordering Enclosed or Semi-Enclosed Seas"" provides the states' right to ""coordinate the management, conservation, exploration and exploitation of the living resources of the sea"", and to ""coordinate the implementation of their rights and duties with respect to the protection and preservation of the marine environment"". However, the recent transformation of the international maritime law gives Arctic countries some opportunities in this area. First, the regime of the high seas is becoming less conducive for implementation of specific types of maritime activities. In the future, we can expect that the extent of regulation in this area of the World ocean will be significantly increased. The implementation of the high seas freedoms is largely conditioned by the realization of the tasks to protect and preserve the marine environment and its biodiversity. Second, there is a continuing practice of expanding the authority of coastal states in their jurisdiction zones, especially in the EEZ. Despite the fact that the coastal state is not granted any competence in the field of the EEZ security, the practice of a broad interpretation of the ""security"" concept includes food, resource and environment security. The enforcement of such security regimes is becoming an increasingly common practice, even though it imposes certain restrictions for third countries' rights in these sea areas. Finally, the adoption of security measures in the EEZ, on one hand, and at the high sea, on the other, should be recognized interdependent and considered all together. In the near future, the number of potential security threats can be significantly expanded due to the increase in the number of maritime activities participants. In addition to the already existing non-military threats (pollution of the marine environment; illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing), new threats may appear: armed robbery of ships (piracy); acts of terrorism affecting both the shipping and offshore installations (oil and gas platforms); illegal transportation of weapons, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD); illegal transportation of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; illegal movement of people by sea, including illegal migration. An effective response to these types of threats requires not only individual efforts of the Arctic Five countries, but also collective security measures. In this regard, in order to create a regional security model, the development of collaboration and cooperation between the Arctic countries is essential.",2016.0,NAUKA PUBLISHING HOUSE,International Relations,NON-MILITARY TREATS TO THE ARCTIC SECURITY,Political science,Pavel A.,Pavel,0.0,0.0

However, the NFIP does not currently map erosion hazard areas and therefore is unable to inform homeowners of the risk to their property.

Historically, very little breeding effort has been applied to the selection of winter cultivars suited to southern Australia, with the notable exception of the New South Wales Agriculture breeding program based in Wagga and Temora that ran from the 1960s until 2002. A shift by growers to earlier sowing, increased usage of dual-purpose cereals, and research highlighting the whole-farm benefits of winter cultivars to average farm wheat yield has increased grower interest and demand for winter cultivars. Three major wheat breeding companies operating in southern Australia have responded by commencing selection for milling quality winter cultivars, the first of which was released in 2017. Existing research relating to winter wheats in southern Australian farming systems is reviewed here, including interactions with agronomic management, environment and weeds and disease. It is concluded that winter wheats can offer significant production and farming system benefits to growers by allowing earlier establishment, which increases water-limited potential yield (PYw) by similar to 15% relative to later sown spring wheats, and makes forage available for dual-purpose grazing during vegetative development. Winter wheats sown early require agronomic management different to that of later sown spring wheats, including greater attention to control of grass weeds and certain diseases. There are significant research gaps that will prevent growers from maximising the opportunities from new winter cultivars once they are released. The first of these is a well-defined establishment window for winter cultivars, particularly in mediuml-ow rainfall environments of South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia that have not historically grown them. There is circumstantial evidence that the yield advantage of early established winter wheats over later sown spring wheats is greatest when stored soil water is present at establishment, or the soil profile fills during the growing season. Explicit confirmation of this would allow growers to identify situations where the yield advantage of winter wheats will be maximised. Given the imminent release of several new winter wheat cultivars and the increases inPY(w) that they embody, it is critical to experimentally define the management and environmental conditions under which performance of these new genotypes are optimised, before their release and availability to growers. Optimising the genotype x environmental x management interactions possible with these cultivars will empower growers to make the best use of the technology and better realise the gains in water limited potential yield possible with these genotypes.",2017.0,CSIRO PUBLISHING,Agriculture,Winter wheat cultivars in Australian farming systems: a review,Agriculture,James R.,James,0.0,0.0

To address these threats, a large amount of literature has characterized and assessed the physical, social, economic and institutional dimensions of disaster risk. However, much less attention has been paid to the social-ecological dimension of vulnerability and risk. The lack of consideration of this dimension represents a major knowledge gap, especially when considering that environmental degradation is regarded as one of the primary drivers of risk to natural hazards worldwide. While the international community advocates for the restoration of ecosystems as an important strategy for disaster risk reduction, the relationship between environmental health, vulnerability and risk of populations is often overlooked in vulnerability and risk assessment, a precondition for the design and implementation of effective ecosystem-based adaptation strategies. Possible explanations for this gap are: (1) the contradictory results on the role of ecosystem health in determining risk of local communities; (2) the poor theoretical framing of the social-ecological dimension of vulnerability and risk to natural hazards; or (3) the lack of clarity regarding how to assess this dimension of risk. This paper addresses potential reasons (2) and (3). It first reviews the available literature related to social-ecological drivers of vulnerability and risk of local communities exposed to natural hazards.

In high-income countries, the carbon footprints of health-care systems have been estimated to be 3-10% of the total national GHG emissions, but no in-depth investigation has been done for China. This study aims to examine the carbon footprint of the Chinese health-care system and identify emission hotspots. Methods Environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis were used to assess the lifecycle GHG emissions of the Chinese health-care system. A satellite account of GHG emissions was constructed for 46 economic sectors in China using energy data from the National Bureau of Statistics based on the numbers reported by a large number of enterprises. Data on health expenditure for medical institutions, pharmaceuticals, construction, administration, and research were obtained from multiple Chinese official statistics yearbooks and the national input-output table. Findings In 2012, China spent CNY 2539 billion on health care, leading to emissions of 315 (68% CI 267-363) megatonnes CO2 equivalent. Health care accounted for 2.7% (68% CI 2.3-3.1) of China's total GHG emissions. The major contributors of GHG emissions in the health-care system were public hospitals (148 megatonnes [47%]), nonhospital purchased pharmaceuticals (56 megatonnes [18%]), and construction (46 megatonnes [15%]). In medical institutions, energy use for buildings and transport accounted for only 16% of the total carbon footprint, whereas 84% was embodied in the purchased goods and services. Interpretation China has a much smaller health-care carbon footprint per capita than developed countries, such as the USA and Australia. However, its carbon emissions per unit of health expenditure are relatively high because of the expenditure structure and the carbon intensity of the country's entire economy. The results suggest the need for a nationwide carbon-efficient target for health care and use of low-carbon alternatives in making supply chain choices to achieve reductions in the carbon footprint.

However, the implementation of these measures raises significant individual and political resistance. The themes of this research relate specifically to the role of communication and to trust in the institutions responsible for implementing this measure. Communication has to be designed in a way to decrease distortions in individuals' risk perception and to help improving quality of the governance of the adaptation to coastal flooding due to sea level rise. We conducted a questionnaire among 782 French coastal residents to deal with these two main dimensions of the acceptability of relocation. Firstly, we question the conditions for a favourable communication strategy by estimating the differentiated impact of communication using fear or conversely humour. Secondly, we study trust in institutions in charge of the implementation of relocation policies with several criteria of governance quality. Our results underline that humour-based communication has the comparative advantage of inducing a stronger emotional response in terms of stimulating interest and thought. Furthermore, the survey highlighted the influence of governance quality. These results confirm the decisive role of governance mechanisms for the acceptability of relocation.

However, such situations make the supplier selection problem more complex. Decision-makers need to balance between suppliers' green levels and consumers' aspiration levels. The supplier selection problem is a typical multiple criteria decision-making problem. In the green supplier selection problem, only a few studies consider the market segmentation of green consumers. However, the decision environment comprises supplier's dynamic risk and goals with different importance is not considered. In the green supplier selection problem, to overcome key limitations of previous literature, this study includes several contributions. First, this study constructs a fuzzy goal programming model focusing on the importance of a supplier portfolio and order allocation. To improve satisfaction degree of the green goals, this study proposes a fuzzy goal programming model incorporating multiple importance function. The functions provide adequate satisfaction levels for goals with a lower priority. Second, this study pioneers the integration of a supplier's dynamic risk and green market segmentation in supplier selection problems.

The outcome of this combination of factors seriously limits the possibility of cross-referencing archaeological data with palaeo-ecological and -climatological data without controlling for these effects, undermining the central archaeological pillar in support of adaptive cycling in Amazonia.

Efforts to reduce food waste at the consumer level are urgently needed to address the most prominent nutrition and environmental sustainability issues we now face. Importantly, individuals report that saving money is a salient motivator for reducing food waste, yet contemporary evidence on the consumer cost of wasted food is lacking. The objectives of this study are to 1) estimate the daily per capita cost of food wasted, inedible, and consumed 2) at home and away from home, and 3) by food group. Methods This study utilizes cross-sectional, nationally-representative data on food intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2016), linked with nationally representative data on food waste from published literature, as well as data on food prices and food price inflation from multiple publicly-available sources. Survey-weighted procedures estimated daily per capita expenditure on food waste for 39,758 adults aged >= 20 y.

Drought will likely continue inputting immense pressure on food security in fragile ecosystems like Sub-saharan Africa (SSA). As an adaptation measure to severe drought events since the 1980s, the overall goal of irrigated schemes (foreign exchange earnings) thus has been shifted to sustain food security. This study assessed the impacts of such drought-driven agricultural policy and future climate change on the performance of large irrigated schemes in SSA, with special emphasis on the Gezira scheme, GS (0.88 mha), Sudan. The optimized scenario of the baseline period, developed in GAMS (the general algebraic modeling system), showed that the expansion of food crops on the expensive of cash crops resulted in a reduction of 83 % in gross net benefits and loss of 63 % in irrigation water in the GS since the severe drought of 1984. The biased corrected rainfall and temperature outputs of three randomly selected regional climate models (RCMs) under unmitigated pathways (RCP 8.5), suggested increased rainfall of 40 mm, increased temperature of 3.3 degrees C and 5 % increase in reference evapotranspiration for the period 2040-2070, compared to the baseline (1960-1990). The predicted conditions experienced neither extreme drought nor extreme wet events; however, severe and moderately drought events remain a challenge up to 2060. Due to climate change and current water management practices, the FAO-Aquacrop predicted reductions in crop yields and water productivity, especially for cotton and sorghum of 40 and 29 % respectively.

Terrestrial animals such as reindeer and Arctic foxes have also been of some importance, as have musk ox in some areas. However, the effects of a changing climate on the marine environment are stark, immediate, and tangible. Ice is melting, and coastal waters are warming. Sea ice, glaciers, coastlines, and seas have become sites and objects for new forms of environmental governance shaped by ideas of unique and fragile ecosystems under threat at a moment of planetary crisis.

Within this policy void, many state governments are stepping up and taking action on adaptation planning. Yet we know little about why some states adopt State Adaptation Plans (SAPs), while others do not. This article investigates factors that predict the emergence of SAPs, both in terms of policy adoption and policy intensity (goal ambitiousness). Applying the diffusion of innovation theory, I consider the relative influence of internal state characteristics, regional pressures, and test for conditional effects between government ideologies and severity of the problem. The results show interesting differences between predictors that influence policy adoption and ambitiousness. States are more motivated to adopt a policy when faced with greater climate vulnerability, have more liberal citizenry, and where governments have crossed policy hurdles by previously passing mitigation plans. The intensity of policies and goal setting, moreover, is more likely to be driven by interest group politics and diffuse through policy learning or sharing information among neighboring states in Environmental Protection Agency regions. These findings support an emerging scholarship that uses more complex dependent variables in policy analysis. These variables have the potential to differentiate symbolic from substantive policies and capture finer information about predictors of importance.",2020.0,WILEY,Government & Law,Policy Adoption and Policy Intensity: Emergence of Climate Adaptation Planning in US States(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras Clave,Political science,Saatvika,Saatvika,,

National responses vary in coherence, degree of sophistication, capacity and relationship to sustaining or rehabilitating livelihoods. In part this reflects governing coalition political priorities - in the absence of war even a very poor state can mount programmes averting mass migration and famine (e.g. Tanzania).

Its victims suffer prolonged pain, physical incapacitation, and social and economic disruption. This study identifies geographical patterns of guinea worm disease in Ghana in 1989, just before a national eradication campaign was launched. The broadest belts of disease correspond with long dry seasons, water shortages, and deep water tables over Voltaian sandstone formations. A major ''disease hearth'' is located in the Northern Region savanna woodland, with rates rising to about 200 per 1000 population. In the rain forest, rates drop below 1 per 1000. Cyclical and seasonal labor migrations result in regional spread of dracunculiasis. The Upper Regions enjoy low rates of infestation, despite constant disease assault by returning migrants. This outcome is based on favorable geology, and hand-pump tube well programs. Village water security in the Upper West Region is associated with a reversal of the seasonal incidence of dracunculiasis. The dry coastal plains are associated with elevated dracunculiasis, but irrigation projects appear to be a compounding influence in the creation of ''hot spots'' or foci of disease.

The world-wide efforts to mitigate and adapt climate change have a concerted focus on increasing the forest and green cover and augmenting the process for achieving the land degradation neutrality. The global scientific and policy making bodies have agreed upon a common agenda to minimise the implications of climate variability and to realise that it has become essentially vital to act on both the fronts of mitigation and adaptation synergistically and find ways to dovetail them for optimizing the efforts at all levels of efforts. Agroforestry provides with such opportunities in tremendously beneficial ways. This has potential not only to provide an alternative to the traditional plantation but at the same time offers a package of ecological and sustainable economic benefit. Natural rubber based agroforestry on swidden fallow and degraded land may significantly contribute to strengthen the resilience of the overall ecosystem as well as of the farming community by diversifying their livelihood activities in the face of climate change. Rubber is a popular cash crop in Southeast Asia and South Asia, and has been grown mainly as monoculture plantations. In Asia and Southeast Asia continents, natural rubber has been cultivated in slash and burn agriculture system since long back. However, with the advent of rubber-based agroforestry models it has been being recognised as an effective land management system and is seen as an alternative to swidden agriculture. Though, it needs extensive trials and testing before actually implementing the agroforestry model on a specific type of soil and climatic settings.

1084,"Lomborg, Bjorn","Stanford Univ, Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen Consensus Ctr, Hoover Inst, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",1.0,"Climate change is real and its impacts are mostly negative, but common portrayals of devastation are unfounded. Scenarios set out under the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) show human welfare will likely increase to 450% of today's welfare over the 21st century. Climate damages will reduce this welfare increase to 434%. Arguments for devastation typically claim that extreme weather (like droughts, floods, wildfires, and hurricanes) is already worsening because of climate change. This is mostly misleading and inconsistent with the IPCC literature. For instance, the IPCC finds no trend for global hurricane frequency and has low confidence in attribution of changes to human activity, while the US has not seen an increase in landfalling hurricanes since 1900. Global death risk from extreme weather has declined 99% over 100 years and global costs have declined 26% over the last 28 years. Arguments for devastation typically ignore adaptation, which will reduce vulnerability dramatically. While climate research suggests that fewer but stronger future hurricanes will increase damages, this effect will be countered by richer and more resilient societies. Global cost of hurricanes will likely decline from 0.04% of GDP today to 0.02% in 2100. Climate-economic research shows that the total cost from untreated climate change is negative but moderate, likely equivalent to a 3.6% reduction in total GDP. Climate policies also have costs that often vastly outweigh their climate benefits. The Paris Agreement, if fully implemented, will cost $819-$1,890 billion per year in 2030, yet will reduce emissions by just 1% of what is needed to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. Each dollar spent on Paris will likely produce climate benefits worth 11 cent. Long-term impacts of climate policy can cost even more. The IPCC's two best future scenarios are the ""sustainable"" SSP1 and the ""fossil-fuel driven"" SSP5. Current climate-focused attitudes suggest we aim for the ""sustainable"" world, but the higher economic growth in SSP5 actually leads to much greater welfare for humanity. After adjusting for climate damages, SSP5 will on average leave grandchildren of today's poor $48,000 better off every year. It will reduce poverty by 26 million each year until 2050, inequality will be lower, and more than 80 million premature deaths will be avoided. Using carbon taxes, an optimal realistic climate policy can aggressively reduce emissions and reduce the global temperature increase from 4.1 degrees C in 2100 to 3.75 degrees C. This will cost $18 trillion, but deliver climate benefits worth twice that. The popular 2 degrees C target, in contrast, is unrealistic and would leave the world more than $250 trillion worse off. The most effective climate policy is increasing investment in green R&D to make future decarbonization much cheaper. This can deliver $11 of climate benefits for each dollar spent.

Model simulations suggest cumulative emissions could be similar, under scenarios where carbon storage ceases, or stored carbon is released, to emissions expected in the absence of any natural mitigation. If climate change is to be minimized, no-regrets approaches to natural mitigation should be considered (e.g., by reducing deforestation), as emissions targets that could limit warming to 1.5 degrees C cannot be met without mitigation of this magnitude.

When measured for a summer dry period, the sites, watercourse distances and bryophyte associations had significantly different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) experienced by the lichen thalli, and therefore affecting physiological response. Furthermore, the field sampled response and growth rates were consistent, supporting the use of riparian woodland with a buffer of c. 500 m as an adaptation option that would allow lichen populations to adjust position (further or nearer from a watercourse) as they migrate locally into microclimatic space when responding to macroclimatic change.

Measurements of mass variations by the GRACE gravity satellite or by ground-based observations of river or groundwater level variations do not permit the determination of the respective storage volumes, which could be considerably bigger than the mass variations themselves. For fully humid tropical conditions like the Amazon the relationship between GRACE and river discharge is linear with a phase shift. This permits the hydraulic time constant to be determined and thus the total drainable storage directly from observed runoff can be quantified, if the phase shift can be interpreted as the river time lag. As a time lag can be described by a storage cascade, a lumped conceptual model with cascaded storages for the catchment and river network is set up here with individual hydraulic time constants and mathematically solved by piecewise analytical solutions. Tests of the scheme with synthetic recharge time series show that a parameter optimization either versus mass anomalies or runoff reproduces the time constants for both the catchment and the river network tau C and tau R in a unique way, and this then permits an individual quantification of the respective storage volumes. The application to the full Amazon basin leads to a very good fitting performance for total mass, river runoff and their phasing (Nash-Sutcliffe for signals 0.96, for monthly residuals 0.72). The calculated river network mass highly correlates (0.96 for signals, 0.76 for monthly residuals) with the observed flood area from GIEMS and corresponds to observed flood volumes. The fitting performance versus GRACE permits river runoff and drainable storage volumes to be determined from recharge and GRACE exclusively, i.e. even for ungauged catchments. An adjustment of the hydraulic time constants (tau C, tau R) on a training period facilitates a simple determination of drainable storage volumes for other times directly from measured river discharge and/or GRACE and thus a closure of data gaps without the necessity of further model runs.",2020.0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,Geology,Quantification of drainable water storage volumes on landmasses and in river networks based on GRACE and river runoff using a cascaded storage approach - first application on the Amazon,Earth sciences,Johannes,Johannes,0.0,0.0

A target approach utilising land-use change indicators is often used to quantify and communicate progress, based upon assumed greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reductions. This paper investigated areal targets for woodland expansion and peatland restoration, both of which can deliver substantial carbon sequestration benefits, with uptake typically supported by grant incentives. A case study used empirical data to investigate realisation of such targets in Scotland referenced against ambitious policy commitments (net-zero emissions by 2045). Analysis of actual locations for recent afforestation and peatland restoration, referenced against biophysical data, showed that new woodland primarily occurred on land that was marginal for agriculture, usually on wetter uncultivated semi-natural land, often on organic soils. This acts to constrain net carbon gains. Both peatland restoration and new woodland show tendency to aggregate in specific zones or locations, regardless of biophysical opportunities, highlighting underlying socioeconomic factors. Differential patterns of uptake are also shown by grant applications across different land use groups. Socioeconomic factors act against more ubiquitous uptake of incentive schemes, especially for new woodland on improved agricultural land, which will constrain long-term decarbonisation objectives unless tackled directly. Investigation therefore shows that use of simple targets (e.g. trees planted) as headline progress indicators can be misleading, potentially contributing to policy failure and misuse of carbon offsets.

We have tried to better understand this apparent climate scepticism by enquiring amongst vine-growers, wine-makers, vintners and some of their institutional partners, in two French PDO vineyards so as to gather their point of view on the on-going climate change. Results are more or less in line with former studies. However, while the interviewees agree with the researchers in listing some important changes in the grapes and wines, they do not attribute them to climate warming but instead to the technical change and the yield reduction that have spread amongst the French vineyards since the mid 1980s. This discrepancy can be first related to the special emphasis they put on practices, and their ability to deal with the yearly climate variations. Yet the divergence can also be related to the framing of the problem.

Determining an adequate CO2 tax level is complicated for political reasons, but even more so for scientific, economic, and ethical reasons. Through a literature review and subsequent analyses, this study explores the influence of methodological choices on greenhouse gas (GHG) environmental costs, focussing on the European context. Two main approaches exist, relying either on marginal damage costs (MDCs; 17 studies considered) or on marginal abatement costs (MACs; five studies considered). Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) quantify the utility losses for individuals, expressed as MDCs. Only seven of the 17 studies examined policy-relevant GHG MDCs applicable to the European context. Current MDCs are either limited in terms of impacts considered (and those that are included are based on dated cause-effect relationships) or rely on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)-based impact functions that disregard, or arbitrarily include, disutility from impacts on non-marketed goods and services, including due to catastrophic events. Therefore, this paper identifies development needs of the IAMs. MACs, in turn, correspond to politically consistent costs to achieve politically set goals, if existing, with no immediate link to the impacts avoided. Depending on the methodological choices made, MDCs and MACs may well span two orders of magnitude. Consensus exists that discounting be conducted at low (social) rates. Primarily moral arguments support the use of equity weighting. Because there are impacts specific to CO2 and CH4 and unrelated to radiative forcing, and because measures differ between GHGs, using global warming potentials (GWPs) for deriving non-CO2 environmental costs from those for CO2 is only a fall-back solution. For a better policy support, MDCs that comprehensively cover climate change impacts and show a high degree of detail should be provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, increasing water use efficiency and better management of existing resources have become substantially important. The agricultural sector is responsible for around 80% of global freshwater withdrawal. Wheat is one of the most important crops having large volumes of virtual water (VW) which is defined as the hidden water embedded in the products. Methods Water footprint (WF) is an indicator showing the total volume of freshwater consumption of a product or process. Blue water concept is defined as the amount of exploited surface and groundwater resources. Green water represents the total volume of rainwater allocated by the product. WF methodology brings a new approach to inter-regional water use and management by quantifying the amount of direct and indirect water use and tracing the hidden links between production, consumption and trade. The main objective of this study is to analyze Turkey's national blue and green WF of wheat production, consumption and virtual water trade between 2008 and 2019. Detailed province-based quantification of wheat's water exploitation is provided using spatial interpolation method. Results Total consumptive WF of wheat production and consumption of Turkey is calculated as 39.3 and 48.1 Gm(3)/year, respectively. The average blue and green VW contents of wheat production through Turkey are assessed to be 1161 and 748 m(3)/ton, respectively. The water footprint parameters of each province are calculated and discussed using climatic and agricultural data. VW transfer of Turkey's international wheat trade is also analyzed. Total national water saving is calculated as 7.8 Gm(3)/year which is mostly imported from Russia. Global VW deficit due to international wheat trade is calculated to be 1.76 Gm(3)/year. Conclusion Despite its high contribution to global wheat production, increasing population and strong wheat-based diet, quantitative, comparative and up-to-date analyses of the blue and green WF and the VW transfer of wheat production in Turkey are not available.

Shifts in diets with different production and processing structures likely have a more considerable impact in future: higher land requirements (e.g., more animal-based proteins) or changing production regions and structures (e.g., higher share of (imported) processed food). Whether the expected transition in low- and middle-income countries that is considerably larger than in high income countries is resilient, is questionable. Beyond, the resilience of food systems is not consistently assessed and hardly synthesized for low- and middle-income countries. A systematic review based on a keyword search was therefore conducted to identify research gaps on food system resilience for low- and middle-income countries. This review identified three clusters of studies: studies in cluster 1 (global models and primary production) mainly model global (change) impacts on crop production, mostly disregard the downstream of the value chain and use globally accessible crop data (e.g., for cereals). Studies in cluster 2 (farmers' behavior under global change) mainly analyze with surveys and workshop formats the resilience of farmers and farming households under global change phenomena such as climate change and equally explore especially farmers' adaptative capacity. Studies in cluster 3 (food systems and value chains) take a more holistic perspective and mostly qualitatively analyze the resilience of food systems based on existing studies. Quantitatively, most studies model the robustness of food systems and not their transformability.

To do so, it conducts a case review of the 'One Less Nuclear Power Plant' (OLNPP) policy adopted under the progressive leadership of Mayor Park Won-soon (2011-). The policy was launched in April 2012, with a target of cutting energy use by 2 million tons of oil equivalent (TOE), which is equivalent to the capacity of one nuclear power plant. The target was accomplished in June 2014, six months ahead of schedule. The second phase of OLNPP has been in progress since August 2014 (and is due to complete in 2020). Focusing on its first phase (2012-2014), the article looks into the OLNPP as an experiment for the city's transition to a resilient energy regime. Following the Introduction, the article reviews the conceptual relationships between risk, resilience and governance in an urban context. This is followed by examination of the background of the OLNPP policy, which was adopted by a progressive leader, and of how the OLNPP as an energy transition project is formulated as geared to enhancing resilience in the city's energy regime. The next section addresses the progressive mode of governing the implementation of the OLNPP, which leads to resilient energy life, giving rise to a progressive form of city.

Climate change is likely to increase the scale of displacement in the Asia Pacific region, leading to intensified patterns of migration as well as resettlement. These two processes, though differing in terms of individual agency and the role of the state, are likely to further exacerbate pressure on urban areas. As the limits to adaptation in risky places are reached, people are increasingly pursuing migration as a way of coping. This strategy demonstrates people's agency to respond to risks and opportunities. Resettlement, in contrast, tends to undermine people's agency. This risk response is increasingly being implemented by states as part of climate change adaptation plans, yet, it often results in the creation of new vulnerabilities for those forcibly resettled. Through a focus on the 'climate hotspot' of the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, this paper explores how communities and governments might anticipate and resolve some of the humanitarian, livelihood and ecological challenges associated with resettlement in an increasingly resource-constrained and risky climate future. The concept of just resilience is proposed as a lens through which the consequences of resettlement for people's connections to place, each other and familiar ways of life can be understood.

Traditional cost-benefit analysis cannot account for the value created through optionality. ROA sets out to amend this. There are however several profound problems with how ROA tries to do this. It is typically not clear what is the baseline plan, without options, against which value is to be estimated. Different baselines significantly change option value. Even if option value can unequivocally be established for a given scenario, ROA relies on expected values over a set of scenarios. First, this requires assigning weights, or probabilities, to scenarios. Given the long-time horizon involved in climate adaptation, these probabilities are meaningless.

A theoretical model from the literature of ""low-hanging fruits"" is applied to determine if rising prices of the CDM can be expected in the future. The results indicate that the benefits for developing countries must increase so as to keep the CDM attractive for them in an environment where they also have reduction commitments. To further ensure the effectiveness of the CDM under the Paris Agreement, policy should ensure that developing countries actually charge higher prices and, at the same time, contribute adequately to the global goal of GHG reductions. To this end, developing countries should be permitted to demand benefits that lie outside the current scope of the CDM, and non-compliance with their climate targets should also be sanctioned.

While art historians have often found the earth art movement to exemplify a new awareness of the geological impact of human activity on the planet, I argue that art may engender a more genuinely planetary perspective when it pays attention to those forces we cannot compel. Gesturing towards the limits of human agency with regard to the Earth may ultimately be a more effective way of challenging anthropocentrism, and of locating human history within planetary time. My analysis draws on works by four contemporary artists - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer (Canada/Mexico), Claudia Muller (Chile), Paul Rosero Contreras (Ecuador) and Michelle-Marie Letelier (Germany/Chile) - that explore the science of turbulent dynamics that are impervious to human action, such as solar flares, earthquakes, winds, tides, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. As Nigel Clark argues, the fundamental asymmetry that governs our relationship with a volatile planet is often lost in accounts of the entanglement of human and nonhumans that have recently prevailed in the humanities and social sciences. The works I discuss revise the practices of earth art to create a 'planetary art', cultivating a sense of the planet beyond the human that allows us to understand its dynamics more fully, and to resituate human agency more properly within geohistories of matter and energy.

This study found that most papers applied empirical case study methodologies, highlighted how governance deficits contributed to environmental injustice and were normatively premised on the need to solve the particular and case based problems of global inequality related to resource use and distribution. However, existing studies fell short of identifying the conceptual preconditions and ideal parameters for fair access and allocation of environmental resources in international economic systems. Future research is needed on the extent, nature and causes of the underlying normative and structural elements of the international economic systems that entrench unfair access and allocation of environmental goods and services; on the nature and protagonists of environmental rights and duties and on the elements of governance that may guarantee fair access and allocation in international trade, aid and investment.",2020.0,SPRINGER,Business & Economics,"International aid, trade and investment and access and allocation",Economics,Michelle,Michelle,1.0,1.0

As investigated through the business dynamics operating in Jamaica's cassava value chain, companies are exposed to a series of trade-offs generated within their business environment. In particular, networks are shown to generate both opportunities and constraints that affect business adaptive behaviour and to be a mechanism to influence and be influenced by others. Two fundamental network-level actions that businesses can foster to increase their adaptive capacity and maintain local economic development can be drawn from this assessment. First, by effectively managing relationships, business can unlock access to valuable resources for adaptation. Second, the dynamic and interdependent nature of business relationships calls for business adaptation efforts to focus on the development of collaborative and joint problem-solving approaches.

While the degree to which climate change alters conflict outcomes remains a topic of considerable debate in academic communities, policy organizations are already being tasked with incorporating climate-conflict into policy and programming. This article investigates how climate-conflict discourses inform development policy and, in turn, how the structures of development enable or constrain institutions' ability to address climate-conflict priorities. Drawing upon mixed-methods and multi-sited data collection, including nine months of participant observation, interviews, a survey of local government officials, and a document review, I investigated the ways in which development practitioners seek to address climate-conflict. Data collection focused on two particular programs being implemented by Mercy Corps, an international humanitarian and development NGO, in Karamoja, Uganda, a region emerging from a period of violent conflict manifesting largely between ethnically defined pastoralist groups. In examining how the wider discourses of climate-conflict inform these programs, I demonstrate why there exists such a wide disparity between the demand for development programming that addresses the conflict risks of climate change and the distinct lack of clarity regarding what such programming might entail. More specifically, I identify the following overlapping challenges facing development agencies seeking to address climate-conflict: complex spatial scales across disconnected geographies, imprecise and limiting discursive framings, and challenges related to program governance. In addition to identifying these barriers, I also demonstrate that clearer paths for development intervention emerge when the narrow conceptualizations of climateconflict are widened beyond climate change's role as a driver of conflict or 'threat multiplier'.

The study period was from 1980 to 2019. Results The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases.

Understanding and assessing loss and damage are the prime objectives of the Warsaw International Mechanism. While numerous studies have emerged to estimate the impact on crop production, income, on-farm employment and financial status, there are only limited studies with respect to assessing loss and damage to intangible resources and the total cost of a drought in particular. By interviewing droughtaffected farmers in the Kutch district of Gujarat state, this study aims to understand the perception of farmers and to estimate total economic value and noneconomic loss and damage. A contingent valuation method was employed. In sum, two major findings emerged: (i) intensity of economic loss and damage is perceived as relatively high as compared to noneconomic loss and damage, although the reverse was expected, and (ii) the average total economic value of a drought was INR 8303, and the mean value of noneconomic loss and damage was INR 4831. This study reveals that households give lower value to intangible losses that occurs over a period than the immediate tangible loss and damage which directly affect their total wealth. Given this, community-level adaptations to minimize non-economic loss and damage are less likely to be formulated.

This article investigates whether the South African statute and common law provide sufficient protection to landowners, from a game ownership perspective, as the impacts of climate change become evident. It was discovered that the complexity derived from the relationship between landownership, legislation and common law (1) required wildlife areas to be isolated fenced areas, (2) may lead to loss of ownership of game which escapes as a consequence of climate change and (3) provided for the possible loss of ownership of all game occurring in the wildlife area and those emigrating when all or part of an encircling boundary fence is removed to establish a wildlife or climate change corridor. It is further recommended that the Game Theft Act 105 of 1991 requires substantial amendment to enable owners of wildlife areas to retain ownership of game that escapes or emigrates in response to climate change. Finally, it is recommended that landowners acquire and include into their fenced wildlife areas an additional area as an interim measure to mitigate the impacts of climate change, until such time that the desired legislative change is implemented.

This straightforward approach indicates that the world's forests sequester 8.3 GtCO(2)year(-1).

Influence is framed as a factor of resources exchanged, organisational and institutional structures, and rules determining stakeholder engagement.

It observes how empirical research in this multidisciplinary area is, first, still relatively scarce and especially very recent, and second, that it is largely disconnected from conceptual debates led in urban studies. I argue that this underdeveloped discussion not only slows down development of a more critical academic perspective on the issue that would be based in urban studies of Central and East European cities, but it can also impact how responses to climate change are thought through by local actors.",2020.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Area Studies,Not soglobalclimate change?

Both maps, however, emphasized dryland regions, with arid biomes making up 36%-42% of potential restoration area. Dryland biomes have repeatedly been recognized as inappropriate regions for expanding tree cover due to the risks of biodiversity loss, water overconsumption, and fire, so maps that highlight these regions for restoration must sustain careful scrutiny. Here, I show that both recent attempts to map restoration potential in arid regions have been hindered by underlying errors in the global tree cover maps they used. Systematic underestimates of existing sparse tree cover led directly to large overestimates of the potential for tree recovery in drylands. The Atlas of Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunities (Laestadius et al.,Unasylva, 2011,62, 47) overestimated tree restoration potential across a third of arid biomes by between 7% and 20% (55-166 million hectares [Mha]). Similarly, Bastin, Finegold, Garcia, Mollicone, et al. (Science, 2019, 365, 76) overestimated tree restoration potential across all arid biomes by 33%-45% (316-440 Mha). These inaccuracies limit the utility of this research for policy decisions in drylands and overstate the potential for tree planting to address climate change. Given this long-standing but underappreciated challenge in mapping global tree cover, I propose various ways forward that keep this lesson in mind. To better monitor and restore tree cover, I call for re-interpretation and correction of existing global maps, and for a new focus on quantifying sparse tree cover in drylands and other systems.",2020.0,WILEY,Biodiversity & Conservation,A lesson unlearned?

This paper offers three propositions focused on the role of intermediaries in the GCF, and tests these using data from the GCF and the wider literature. The results show a growing dominance of international intermediaries in GCF project development and implementation, the low capacity of national intermediaries to conceive and scale projects, and the mismatch between planned and actual funding allocations. Collectively, these outcomes derail the GCF from its core objectives of promoting country ownership of projects, building capacity of local intermediaries, and equitable allocation of funding between mitigation and adaptation.

However, the concept of sustainable development has received a number of criticisms, including its over-emphasis on meeting human needs through economic growth, as well as its failure to recognize dynamic human-environment interactions. In response to these shortfalls, the concepts of resilience and adaptive governance have emerged as alternative perspectives for pursuing sustainable development. Resilience in social-ecological systems emphasizes the capacity of coupled human-environment systems to deal with change, while continuing to develop. Adaptive governance relies on diverse and nested institutional mechanisms for connecting actors across multiple scales to manage conflicts and uncertainties in ecosystem management processes. However, the ethical dimensions of resilience and adaptive governance have not received enough attention. A promising ethical perspective for guiding policies on human-environment interactions is the philosophy of deep ecology, which highlights the need for recognition of the intrinsic values of all living things, as well as the nurturing of ecological and cultural diversity. In this paper, I argue that an integration of the principles of deep ecology and adaptive governance provides a complementary set of ethical principles and institutional attributes that offers better prospects for pursuing sustainable development in the era of the Anthropocene. The implications of this integrative agenda include: the adoption of a holistic conception of dynamic human-environment interactions; the recognition of diverse knowledge systems through an anti-reductionist approach to knowledge; the promotion of long term sustainability through respect for ecological and cultural diversity; and embracing decentralization and local autonomy. I further illustrate this integrative agenda using the management of protected areas as a case study.",2020.0,MDPI,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Integrating Deep Ecology and Adaptive Governance for Sustainable Development: Implications for Protected Areas Management,Interdisciplinary,Kofi,Kofi,0.0,0.0

It was recognized in the 1980s that extractions from the system, largely for irrigation, had to be constrained. That led to the introduction of the ""Murray-Darling Basin Cap"" which limited extractions and recognized the probability of average inflows declining, which was already being predicted by climate change modelling. The ""millennium drought"" of 2000-2009 was very severe and led to fears that the drop in inflows was happening faster than modelling was predicting. In 2007, the National Government, on the eve of an election, declared that the Basin had been mismanaged for a century by the States and legislated to transfer management powers from the States to the Commonwealth. That transfer has been pursued since then by National Governments of both major parties. Government claims to have ""taken the politics out of Basin management and returned to the science.""

Cognitive priors in the climate change context included the 'ASEAN Way' of collaboration and member states' deep-seated aspirations for development. The empirical study shows that internally, ASEAN acted as an interactive space for information exchange and a relationship facilitator; externally, it has embraced the position as the voice amplifier for member states in international negotiations. Maintaining the UNFCCC version of CBDR tallied well with ASEAN's role expectations to: 1) provide member states with room to develop national actions that meet their respective priorities (internal); and 2) put member states in a better position to defend their interests in negotiating adaptation and mitigation responsibilities with extra-regional states (external).",2021.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Area Studies,ASEAN's role expectations and the diffusion of common but differentiated responsibilities principle in the climate change context,Interdisciplinary,Guangyu,Guangyu,,

The seismic risk-coping behavior among rural households of EMC in Dali is surveyed and the relationship between their behavior and the affecting factors are measured by the Binary Logit Model. The results indicate that both HEI and structural retrofit are not widely adopted by households; contrarily, most prefer relying on fiscal subsidies to cope with seismic risk instead of taking precautionary action. Their behavior has been found to be positively influenced by risk perception, and negatively affected by fiscal subsidies. Moreover, HEI uptake shows a positive relationship with insurance experience and household income, but a negative correlation with migrant-worker ratios. In addition, households with buildings having higher anti-seismic capacity are more reluctant toward structural retrofit.

Quick blame for those losses, or some part, often is placed on claims of more frequent or intense weather events. However, understanding what role changes in climate may have played in increasing weather-related disaster losses is challenging because, in addition to changes in climate, society also undergoes dramatic change. Increasing development and wealth influence exposure and vulnerability to loss - typically increasing exposure while reducing vulnerability. In recent decades a scientific literature has emerged that seeks to adjust historical economic damage from extreme weather to remove the influences of societal change from economic loss time series to estimate what losses past extreme events would cause under present-day societal conditions. In regions with broad exposure to loss, an unbiased economic normalisation will exhibit trends consistent with corresponding climatological trends in related extreme events, providing an independent check on normalisation results. This paper reviews 54 normalisation studies published 1998-2020 and finds little evidence to support claims that any part of the overall increase in global economic losses documented on climate time scales is attributable to human-caused changes in climate, reinforcing conclusions of recent assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",2021.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Economic 'normalisation' of disaster losses 1998-2020: a literature review and assessment,Environmental studies & forestry,Roger,Roger,0.0,0.0

These factors elevate the urban-rural air temperature (T-a) difference, thus generating the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. T-a is used in the fields of public health and epidemiology to quantify deaths attributable to heat in cities around the world: the presence of UHI can exacerbate exposure to high temperatures during summer periods, thereby increasing the risk of heat-related mortality. Measuring and monitoring the spatial patterns of T-a in urban contexts is challenging due to the lack of a good network of weather stations. This study aims to produce a parsimonious model to retrieve maximum T-a (T-max) at high spatio-temporal resolution using Earth Observation (EO) satellite data. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) it will produce daily estimations of T-max for London at 1 km(2) during the summertime between 2006 and 2017 using advanced statistical techniques and satellite-derived predictors, and (ii) it will investigate for the first time the predictive power of the gradient boosting algorithm to estimate T-max for an urban area. In this work, 6 regression models were calibrated with 6 satellite products, 3 geospatial features, and 29 meteorological stations. Stepwise linear regression was applied to create 9 groups of predictors, which were trained and tested on each regression method. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms to predict T-max: the gradient boosting model with a group of five predictors (land surface temperature, Julian day, normalised difference vegetation index, digital elevation model, solar zenith angle) was the regression model with the best performance (R-2 = 0.68, MAE = 1.60 degrees C, and RMSE = 2.03 degrees C). This methodological approach is capable of being replicated in other UK cities, benefiting national heat-related mortality assessments since the data (provided by NASA and the UK Met Office) and programming languages (Python) sources are free and open. This study provides a framework to produce a high spatio-temporal resolution of T-max, assisting public health researchers to improve the estimation of mortality attributable to high temperatures.

Is that the case? The article explains the challenges of governance configured by a conflict between the spatial planning policy steered by local authorities and the risk prevention policy led by national authorities. This model is further complicated by the tension between the preference for legal, technical or scientific instruments, and the difference in professional culture between planning and prevention.

The legal framework governing fisheries and protecting the marine environment of the Southern Ocean is both global and regional. On the global level, most of the waters around Antarctica fall under the high seas regime of the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), although seven states have asserted a claim to the territorial sea adjacent to their Antarctic territories under the Antarctic Treaty. On a regional level, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) manages fisheries. As climate change will inevitably have impacts on the Southern Ocean, it is important to assess how the current legal framework addresses this issue. The recommendations for climate change adaptation given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are threefold: international cooperation, precautionary approach and ecosystem approach. By evaluating the extent to which these recommendations have been implemented in the global and regional legal frameworks, the flexibility and resilience to tackle climate change of the provisions can be assessed. On the global level, specific provisions from UNCLOS and the Fish Stock Agreement (FSA) provide for both the precautionary and ecosystem approaches.

Green infrastructure (GI) is often associated with sustainable goals that cities strive to achieve through a combination of natural approaches. A key concept in these approaches is the inherent capacity of the natural environment to carry out several functions, meaning that it can provide a variety of ecosystem services and deliver a wide range of policy objectives. Nevertheless, recent studies on the integration of GI into spatial planning have reported limited acknowledgement of the ecosystem services that GI can offer and a lack of a territorial perspective. This paper therefore provides a methodology that facilitates a spatial planning approach to GI planning in metropolitan areas. Based on the definition of GI proposed by the European Commission, which suggests that connectivity and multifunctionality are key to the effective implementation of GI, a two-step methodological approach to GI planning is proposed. This approach is spatially centered, thus promoting the desired territorial perspective, while it also acknowledges the notion of an ecosystem service as a basic design principle.

This is particularly the case for the coastline of Southeast England, where similar to 190 km of shingle barriers protect low-lying hinterland or a coastal plain that is at or barely above the present reach of waves. During the Holocene transgression, these beaches moved into their present position through longshore extension and cross-shore roll back. This process stopped more than a century ago with port developments affecting longshore transport and the construction of groynes to hold the beach in place. This was followed by beach recharge and recycling towards the end of the 20(th) century to build up and maintain beaches as coastal defences in their mid 19(th) century position. This paper explores the design requirements for these beaches under future sea level rise scenarios of 1 to 5 m using recently developed tools. It shows that the presently still semi-natural beaches have to increase in size with crest height elevations having to rise by at least up to 1.26 times the rate of sea level rise and that due to higher longshore wave power, especially during storm conditions in the future, higher and stronger groynes are needed to hold these larger beaches in place. Future design requirements for beaches are sensitive to foreshore levels and orientation of the beach to the dominant waves with those presently characterised by shallow foreshores and oblique wave approach requiring the biggest adjustments. Required size increases will be difficult to implement due to the built-up nature of the hinterland. The engineering alternative would be to replace beaches with hard structures, a process that has already started where maintaining a beach is no longer economically viable or the residual risk associated with overwashing and an eventual tidal breach has become unacceptable.",2017.0,ELSEVIER,Engineering,Design requirement for mixed sand and gravel beach defences under scenarios of sea level rise,Engineering & technology,Uwe,Uwe,0.0,0.0

The budget is quantified in terms of inputs, transfers, storage and outputs of sediment within a littoral cell.

Sediment inputs and subsequent transfers are found to be episodic so that the beaches naturally alternate between open and closed system states according to prevailing transport conditions. Interestingly, the major storm barrier of Chesil Beach is identified as the ultimate shingle sink. These results suggest that the beach did not simply develop as a product of the Holocene transgression as often envisioned, but until recently, it formed part of a larger natural process system with the periodic input of additional shingle from the west, derived from the erosion of massive unstable cliffs. However, several interventions have dislocated these natural linkages, unwittingly reinforcing the closed system states. In the absence of natural replenishment, the modified beaches are becoming increasingly sensitive to the continuing relative sea-level rise and storm activity that characterises this region.

Tidal input to this model is obtained by running a nested series of models commencing with a model of the northeast Atlantic. Results of both types of simulations are compared with those of other simulations incorporating all the palaeogeographic information available on both past water depths and coastline shapes around The Wash. The model employs six harmonic tidal constituents to obtain mean high water of spring tides (MHWST) altitudes. The Wash was a depositional embayment during the Holocene and results of model simulations are compared with sea-level indicators in the stratigraphy which record past MHWST altitudes. Tidal simulations for water depths reduced by 2, 5 and 10 m compared with present sea levels generally give lower tidal amplitudes around The Wash than found at present. MHWST altitudes simulating the coastline shape for 3000, 4000 and 5000 yrs B.P. utilising present water depths show similar patterns of tidal changes to those obtained from the palaeogeographic simulations, However, reduced water-depth tidal simulations accord more closely with the palaeogeographic simulation results in terms of the magnitude of changes to MHWST altitudes than the palaeocoastline simulations. This is due to the fact that the rise in mean sea level during the Holocene is far greater than any change in the amplitude of tides in The Wash. Palaeogeographic simulation model results for MHWST agree, within experimental errors, with sea-level curve altitudes. Reasons for discrepancies include inaccuracies in model parameters or measurement errors in obtaining MHWST altitudes from the stratigraphy. Overall, tidal heights increase with sea-level rise towards the present day. Alterations to coastline shape and non-uniform water-depth changes (for example, due to sediment movements or coastal defence schemes), must be taken into consideration when assessing changes to the tidal regime for different sea levels in coastal embayments in order to determine both the pattern and magnitude of tidal changes.

Appropriateness of shores fronting the planned land uses is assessed in the present study by applying the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) approach, which depends primarily on a variety of variables that affect beach stability of the proposed plans. These variables are prominent morphologic features, shoreline erosion or accretion rates, sea-level rise, beach type (dissipative, reflective, or rhythmic bar), and oceanographic conditions (tidal range and mean wave height). Results disclosed that not all of the examined delta coastlines are equally vulnerable to beach erosion (ranging from relatively low to highly susceptible).

The legal landscape for offshore freshwater aquifers consequently spans domestic, regional, and international regimes, making the governance analysis for this untapped resource complex and multilayered. At the apex of ocean governance lies the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), a global treaty with almost universal application. Both LOSC and customary law grant each coastal state exclusive sovereign rights over seabed natural resources in its continental shelf, although those rights are limited by other legal commitments such as obligations to protect the environment. LOSC does not address transboundary resources, but early and sustained demand for offshore hydrocarbons caused that governance gap to be filled through judicial decisions, bi-lateral treaties, and customary practices. Traditionally, distribution of natural resources has been viewed as a right commensurate with sovereign claims to the resource, but a strong ethical argument can be made for treating water as an exceptional case due to its uniquely life-giving properties. When offshore freshwater is eventually appropriated for use, humanity will have an opportunity to choose between following old patterns of distribution or crafting a more inclusive system. In a world facing global shortages of freshwater due to pollution, overuse and climate change, policymakers designing a legal regime for untapped reservoirs of a vital resource for which there is no substitute should consider more equitable forms of distribution.

These changes are supported by a planning system that encourages the development of residential areas in the peri-urban. However, it has been noticed that rather than completely disappearing, agricultural activities are still visible in the peri-urban environment, and farmers develop adaptation strategies to adjust to this shifting environment. Many factors affecting farmers' adaptation strategies have been studied. One element that remains understudied is the role of farmers' relationship to place. To bridge this gap, we develop a typology of farmers' place identity (land-based and practice-based place identity) and observe how these conceptualisations of place identity can contribute to explaining farmers' adoption of incremental and transformative adaptation strategies in the peri-urban. Based on 24 interviews with 15 farmers our results suggest that farmers with a combined place identity (land-based and practice-based) are more likely to adopt transformative adaptation strategies than farmers with a practice-based place identity who are more likely to adopt incremental adaptation strategies.

This article provides a starting point for investigating the potential rate of unaffordability of flood risk property-level adaptation measures across Europe using two definitions of affordability, which are combined with two different affordability thresholds from within flood risk research. It uses concepts of investment and payment affordability, with affordability thresholds based on residual income and expenditure definitions of unaffordability. These concepts, in turn, are linked with social justice through fairness concerns, in that, all should have equal capability to act, of which affordability is one avenue. In doing so, it was found that, for a large proportion of Europe, property owners generally cannot afford to make one-time payment of the cost of protective measures.

This paper explores the potential for different strategies to protect carbon pricing policies from these attacks through an in-depth analysis of the enactment and subsequent reversal of an economy-wide cap-and-trade programme in Ontario, Canada, from 2015 to 2018. The paper uses process tracing of key government documents, media coverage, and interviews with those involved in the enactment and promotion of the policy, to answer two questions: (1) why did Ontario choose a carbon revenue approach focused on economic development and climate mitigation? and (2) how did that approach make the policy more vulnerable to a populist attack based on higher consumer prices? The analysis tests a central hypothesis grounded in previous research: A failure to focus more on consumer costs in designing and promoting the cap-and-trade progamme is a primary reason for the Ontario policy's startling political failure. In this respect, the paper concludes, Ontario's experience constitutes a warning about the importance of designing and framing carbon pricing policies to defuse the potential power of populist attacks focusing on energy prices for 'working families'. Key policy insights Carbon pricing policies remain vulnerable to populist attacks based on opposition to higher consumer prices. Dedicating carbon revenue to interest groups may undermine the ability to defend the policy against consumer pricing attacks. Carefully explaining a cap-and-trade policy mechanism can be important to building public support for the policy. Neither its complexity nor its integration with international carbon markets protected Ontario's cap-and-trade programme from repeal. Ontario's cap-and-trade policy's repeal can be substantially attributed to the government's approach to allocating carbon revenue.",2020.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Carbon pricing and economic populism: the case of Ontario,Environmental studies & forestry,Leigh,Leigh,0.625,

Debris flows have repeatedly closed the A83 Rest and be Thankful road that passes through the valley, and considerable investment has been directed towards hazard risk reduction. However, little research has focused on the former glaciation and paraglacial response that have played an important role in governing current landscape processes at the site. This paper addresses the knowledge gap by investigating the glacial processes that have shaped and conditioned Glen Croe, and pathways that have characterised subsequent paraglacial sediment transfer. The large-scale valley form results from watershed breaching and interaction between glacier erosion and paraglacial rock slope failures. The distribution of thick glacigenic sediment is conditioned by deposition at former lateral ice margins, which was influenced by topography. Sediment reworking has resulted in accumulation of debris cones and alluvial fans in the upper part of the catchment, and growth of a delta at the outlet. Spatial connectivity mapping supports an interpretation whereby upper Glen Croe is poorly connected to the valley outlet, influencing sediment storage. In contrast, slopes in the lower part of Glen Croe are well connected. Sediment distribution in Glen Croe fits within the context of glaciated valley and paraglacial landsystems, allowing an understanding of sources and transport pathways. In upland infrastructure corridors this type of information is potentially helpful for understanding how landscapes might be affected by renewed sediment reworking under altered threshold conditions.

In such ways, I suggest, Beck's methodological cosmopolitanism is germane to studying ongoing and far ranging transformation in world political geography, in which transurban networks, communities, and governance arrangements come to complement nation-state centred institutions.

The ""4 per 1000"" (4p1000) initiative, launched during the COP 21 in Paris in 2015, based on translating the science of soil carbon sequestration into action at the global scale, is one example of a broader set of negative emission technologies (NETs). While governments and non-governmental organizations are voluntarily implementing the aspirational 4p1000, its adoption and pledges by industry or the private sector is the driving force to accelerate the process of re-carbonization of soil and the terrestrial biosphere. The pledge of achieving carbon (C) neutrality by 2030 or 2050 by some prominent industries is encouraging, and it can serve as a role model for other industries to follow. Adoption of the 4p1000 concept by agro-industries (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, farm machinery, irrigation, food processing) can promote and accelerate adoption of recommended management practices which create a positive/soil ecosystem carbon budget and enhance C sequestration. This review article describes examples of the emission-neutral concept already adopted by some industries, outlines strategies to promote 4p1000 and NETs, and discusses approaches to advance site-specific NETs. These techniques may include conservation agriculture, cover cropping, precision agriculture, etc., facilitated by artificial intelligence, remote sensing, and robots. Innovative methods of soil sampling as well as remote sensing and mapping of SOC stock are pertinent to promoting NETs and 4p1000. Payments to land managers and farmers for provisioning of ecosystem services through C sequestration in soil and the biosphere can advance the mission of 4p1000. Amongst strategies of encouraging industries to adopt NETs, implementation of a ""Healthy Soil Act"" at the state, national, and global level could be a step in the right direction. Market-based economic incentives to industry may be another option to promote adoption of NETs. Similar to U.S. EPA Clean Air Act of 1963 and the U.S. EPA Clean Water Act of 1972, there is a strong need to enact a Healthy Soil Act globally. An effective implementation of the trinity of Acts (air, water, and soil) at the national and global scale will accelerate the process of re-carbonization of the soil and the terrestrial biosphere while also strengthening the provisioning of essential ecosystem services.",2020.0,ELSEVIER,Agriculture,"The role of industry and the private sector in promoting the ""4 per 1000"" initiative and other negative emission technologies",Agriculture,Rattan,Rattan,0.0,0.0

In this paper, a modelling framework is developed to explore how PES negotiations between forestry and fishery-based communities may be affected when warming reduces the stock of fish as well as forest biomass growth rates. Under a PES arrangement, forestry-based communities afforest the lake's catchment region, which helps improve fish stock abundance through reduced sediment loading. When climate warming adversely impacts fish yields, the value of restoring degraded lands in the catchment region increases, making the negotiating powers of the fishing and forestry dependent communities dynamic. Results suggest that the prospect of a climate-driven negotiating power in the future calls for higher PES payments by the fishing community in order to incentivize early restoration. Warming could also affect forest biomass growth rates in the long run. However, findings from this study suggest that warming driven forest biomass growth rate decline may have a relatively lower impact on PES negotiations compared to the direct impact of warming on lake's fish productivity.",2020.0,ELSEVIER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Protecting warming lakes through climate-adaptive PES mechanisms,Environmental studies & forestry,Ram,Ram,0.0,0.0

LDCs' new demographic policy should be aimed at reducing the anthropogenic burden on climate. Within the LDCs themselves, it should be aimed at enforcing economic development and reducing poverty. Over the period when the LDCs have received international assistance, the effectiveness of aid has been shown to be low (the persistent poverty and lack of economic progress). Poverty contributes to the development of international terrorism, internecine local wars, and flows of disorganized migration. Anthropogenic pressure of LDCs on the planet's climate and other aspects of the environment is growing rapidly. In a context when the world is close to the permissible limit of population growth on the planet, such demographic liberalism seems to be excessively risky. To reduce danger, the global community should be more involved in regulating population growth of the LDCs. To this end, the article proposes the development of an international agreement limiting population growth in LDCs. To justify population growth limits, LDCs can use the criteria proposed in the article for balancing population growth with the countries' economic and environmental resources. Environmental criteria are based on the maximum permissible anthropogenic load. Economic criteria suggest maximum permissible population growth rates that would not exceed the rate of economic development of the country.

I discuss several potential sources of confusion in applying Evolutionary concepts to Ethnobiology. Ethnobiological discussions of evolution have focused more on changes in human populations, or on human impacts upon plants used by humans for a variety of purposes, than on the processes typically emphasized in discussions by biologists studying evolution. There has been little acknowledgment of how the field of biological evolution is changing in the 21st Century. In this article I focus on recent developments in evolutionary thinking that could be effectively integrated into Ethnobiological concepts. These include: 1) The increased importance of individual organisms in understanding both population dynamics and microevolutionary change (i.e. natural selection). This change in focus creates the potential for incorporating understandings from Indigenous people who recognize a different set of dynamics that govern how both plant and animal populations are regulated, leading to new insights into how conservation practices should be enacted; 2) Niche Construction, which is a 21st century concept that argues that organisms shape their own environments and those of other species. This approach creates a new way of looking at how Natural Selection can act upon a wide range of organisms; and finally, 3) Reticulate Evolution, in which different species exchange genetic material as a result of behavioral or physiological interactions with major evolutionary consequences. These concepts relate strongly to fundamental Indigenous conceptions of ecosystem functioning, including the ideas that All Things are Connected and that All Life Forms are Related. I argue that Ethnobiology and Indigenous Knowledge are strongest in dealing with phenomena linked to behavior and ecology, which are fields being neglected by many contemporary molecular approaches to understanding evolution. Attempts to deal with Conservation in a world subject to climate change would be greatly improved by working closely with Indigenous peoples and incorporating concepts from these traditions into practices on a global scale.",2020.0,ELSEVIER,History & Philosophy of Science,Historical links between Ethnobiology and Evolution: Conflicts and possible resolutions,History,Raymond,Raymond,0.0,0.0

A particularly interesting market impact is that bioenergy promotion and forest conservation tend to have opposite effects on forest industry by-product prices. Moreover, combining the two policies mitigates the forest industry by-product price increase compared to the case where only the bioenergy-promoting policy is implemented. Namely, the energy using sector (heat and power) is less negatively affected in terms of increased feedstock prices if bioenergy demand targets are accompanied by increased forest conservation. This effect is due to increasing pulpwood prices, which reduces pulp, paper and board production, and in turn mitigates the competition for the associated by-products.

The results indicated that the accumulated radial growth increased linearly with time, even at the age of 90 years, and the average radial increment of each tree ranged from 1.9 to 5.1 mm/year. The variances of basal area increment (BAI) increased with time, and correlated with the variances of precipitation in the growing seasons. Taylor's power law was present in the radial growth, with the scaling exponents concentrated within 1.9-2.1. A ""Triangle""-shaped relationship was found between the precipitation in the growing seasons and annual radial increments. Similar patterns also appeared for the standard precipitation index, maximum monthly air temperature and minimum monthly air temperature. The annual increases were highly correlated with the local climate. Slow growth, resilience to drought and multiple stems in one tree might help the tree species adapt to different climate conditions, with the implications for plantation management discussed in this paper.",2020.0,MDPI,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Historical Radial Growth of Chinese Torreya Trees and Adaptation to Climate Change,Environmental studies & forestry,Xiongwen,Xiongwen,,

However, the intensification of farming practices has altered the microclimates of the wet agricultural soil, the composition of soil invertebrates, thus indirectly affecting the avifauna. This study evaluated the importance of paddy fields as wintering grounds for two avian indicators Asian openbill stork (Anastomus oscitans), and the Black-headed ibis (Threskiornis melanocephalus) along the Cauvery delta basin, widely known as the granary of Tamil Nadu, South India. Several stretches of this agricultural belt have recorded a drastic reduction in crop cover thereby threatening the species that forage these mosaics. This entire delta region is under threat and is increasingly shrinking due to indiscriminate sand mining activities causing irreparable damage to soil, fauna, and agriculture. The erratic monsoons have forced wading species to initiate long migrations in response to climatic adaptations, thus impairing the existing population. The present study focused on the abundance patterns of two wading birds and their association with the hydropedological parameters of the flooded soil along the deltaic dynamic mosaic. The relative abundance of the avifauna was documented for 24 months using unlimited radius point counts. The hydropedological parameters recorded were pH, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, calcium carbonate, organic matter, total organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, moisture, the particle size distribution of sand, silt and clay, water holding capacity, and bulk density. The results indicate that paddy fields are excellent habitat forA. oscitansandT. melanocephalusand are strongly influenced by landscape characteristics, availability of feeding grounds, and hydropedological parameters of the wet soil. Among the hydropedological parameters, organic matter and nitrogen exhibited a negative correlation and the percent silt content showed a positive correlation toA. oscitans.Similarly, T. melanocephalusshowed a negative correlation to chloride and sodium, and a positive correlation to nitrogen. The contrasting effects of hydropedological parameters could be explained by differential thermal tolerance levels and metabolic requirements of the species or may be mediated by changes in the macrofaunal composition. The wet agricultural soil exhibited fewer differences across salinity classes, particle size distribution especially silt and clay, organic matter, total organic carbon, pH and bulk density, and greater differences among calcium content, water holding capacity, the particle size distribution of sand, and electrical conductivity across delta zones. Our study highlights the need to consider hydropedological factors of the wet paddy soil when selecting conservation sites on agro-landscapes for migratory wetland birds.

The focus of the work is on the US east coast and hence the formation and movement of hurricanes over the Atlantic Basin. As an illustrative case, the area around Charleston, South Carolina is considered. Specifically, this paper presents a methodology to prob-abilistically estimate regional hurricane loss considering both hurricane intensity and size as well as projected sea surface temperature change as a function of climate change. It is most common to characterize the hurricane wind hazard using a measure of intensity only. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of accounting for storm size when characterizing the hurricane hazard in order to properly estimate/predict the spatial extent of damage. For purposes of regional loss estimation, therefore, considering maximum wind speed only may not be adequate. A storm with larger size but lower intensity might result in more damage and hence greater total loss than a smaller, more intense storm. Here, the maximum wind speed (intensity) and the radius of maximum winds (spatial extent) are selected as the two dominant indicators (parameters) characterizing the hurricane (event) hazard. The resulting bivariate hazard model is then used as input to a regional loss estimation model to illustrate its potential application. Only hurricane wind damage (and associated losses from both wind damage and water intrusion) is considered in this study. Collateral damage due to flood or storm surge is not addressed here. Simulated events impacting this region are extracted from a synthetic hurricane database (developed by the author and his colleagues) and the joint distribution of intensity and size is established to characterize the hurricane hazard. Regional loss for each simulated hurricane event is then estimated using the loss estimation module in HAZUS_MH. Finally, distributions of regional loss at different (event) hazard levels are generated. A future climate scenario (increasing sea surface temperature) is next considered and the joint distribution of hurricane intensity and size and the resulting loss distribution curve is recomputed. The results are then able to be compared to those under the current climate scenario. Such comparisons can help to inform codes and standards committees, for example, as they consider whether and how to take potential climate change impacts (in the design lifetime) into account. They also can inform ongoing public discourse around mitigation and adaptation, whether hardening of buildings and other infrastructure systems, community resilience planning, construction practices, or related policies.",2021.0,ELSEVIER,Engineering,Projecting the effects of a warming climate on the hurricane hazard and insured losses: Methodology and case study,Engineering & technology,David,David,0.0,0.0

Geographical range shifts among many species were detected rapidly after predictions of the potential importance of climate change were specified 35 years ago: species are shifting their ranges towards the poles and often to higher elevations in mountainous areas. Early tests of these predictions were largely qualitative, though extraordinarily rapid and broadly based, and statistical tests distinguishing between climate change and other global change drivers provided quantitative evidence that climate change had already begun to cause species' geographical ranges to shift. I review two mechanisms enabling this process, namely development of approaches for accounting for dispersal that contributes to range expansion, and identification of factors that alter persistence and lead to range loss. Dispersal in the context of range expansion depends on an array of processes, like population growth rates in novel environments, rates of individual species movements to new locations, and how quickly areas of climatically tolerable habitat shift. These factors can be tied together in well-understood mathematical frameworks or modelled statistically, leading to better prediction of extinction risk as climate changes. Yet, species' increasing exposures to novel climate conditions can exceed their tolerances and raise the likelihood of local extinction and consequent range losses. Such losses are the consequence of processes acting on individuals, driven by factors, such as the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather, that contribute local extinction risks for populations and species. Many mechanisms can govern how species respond to climate change, and rapid progress in global change research creates many opportunities to inform policy and improve conservation outcomes in the early stages of the sixth mass extinction.",2020.0,ROYAL SOC,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,Racing against change: understanding dispersal and persistence to improve species' conservation prospects,Biology,Jeremy T.,Jeremy,0.0,0.0

However, there is limited understanding of the factors that underlie such changes. This study sheds light on these factors by examining the case of Israel - a largely arid to semi-arid country with highly scarce natural water resources and a historical rural-agricultural ideology. Adopting an historically-informed systems perspective, I analyze two transformations that diminished Israel's vulnerability to recurring droughts: the 1960s' economic transformation from agriculture to industry, and the shift to seawater desalination in the mid-2000s. These changes are examined using causal-loop diagrams based on multiple data sources, including archival records, statistical reports and a systematic review of grey and academic literature. The findings show that both transformations, instigated by state institutions during exceptionally severe droughts, were driven by shifts away from development paradigms embedded in the nation-building ideology, as well as by social stresses that exceeded the natural limits of the agricultural system and water supply system. Repeated drought shocks activated and later reactivated the shift to desalination, intended to a certain degree to reduce drought vulnerability. However, drought did not significantly affect the economic transformation, initiated mainly due to saturation in agricultural development. Thus, I argue that alongside concerted adaptation efforts state institutions should dedicate greater attention to the management of broader social challenges and crises in a manner that fosters greater resilience against future climate changes. Ideological shifts and consequent restructuring of development paths, as well as the interaction between population growth and limited natural resources, may constitute important entry points.

Using spatially small-scaled data from multiple decades for European regions, we examine the relationship between precipitation anomalies and economic performance in highly developed economic systems. We conduct a disaggregated empirical analysis to mitigate the bias potentially arising from spatial aggregation because precipitation realizations tend to vary drastically within larger sized economic units. We modify original precipitation indices to capture the dynamic expectation formation of economic agents about climate conditions to measure deviations from these anticipated environmental states. Using panel model regressions in a quasi-experimental research design, we analyse whether deviations from average growth rates of aggregated economic output are potentially non-linearly related to the magnitude of precipitation deviations from the anticipated climate norm within regions, after accounting for any shocks common to all regions. We find that precipitation deviations that exceed critical thresholds (intermediate anomalies) for both unusually dry and unusually wet years reduce regional growth rates. The adverse impacts are more pronounced for overly dry periods. Importantly, the relationship between economic growth and precipitation anomalies is not generalizable across all regions. Natural geographical circumstances such as prevailing climatic conditions (""first nature"" geographies) and human-made socio-economic factors such as sector structure and income level (""second-nature"" geographies) moderate the anomaly response. The empirical findings substantiate the necessity to incorporate precipitation variability into the assessment of economic costs of climate change; not only in developing countries or agricultural societies but also in highly developed economic systems. Moreover, the empirical results have important implications for policy makers as uneven effect sizes at the subnational level suggest that policy measures should be targeted in space and coordinated between national and regional levels of government.",2020.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Precipitation anomalies, economic production, and the role of ""first-nature"" and ""second-nature"" geographies: A disaggregated analysis in high-income countries",Environmental studies & forestry,Linus,Linus,0.0,0.0

Much of the focus for reforestation and afforestation is on developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America, where large areas of rangelands in drylands and grassy biomes are portrayed as ""degraded,"" ""unused,"" and in need of more trees. This perception is rooted in persistent theories on forests and desertification that widely shaped colonial policy and practice and remain influential in today's science-policy frameworks. From a rangelands perspective, the global FLR thrust raises two main concerns.

A systems-thinking approach to examine the construction of vulnerability to flood disasters in Muzarabani district, Zimbabwe is used. Data was gathered from interviews, workshops, field observations and the 2012 census report. Biophysical vulnerability is driven by interacting factors including proximity to low-lying floodplain, interfluves and cyclonic path; flood recession agriculture; heavy erosion and siltation; and use of poor quality materials. Social vulnerability to flooding is propelled by a bundle of demographic and poor socio-economic conditions of the community that make the smallholder farmers succumb to flood impacts. None of those variables make the community vulnerable on its own. Rather, they are mutually inclusive, with each one reinforcing the other(s).

These approaches, in turn, enhance social deprivation and limit rural development, both of which are drivers of economic migration and civil conflict. Exacerbated by population growth, food systems lie at the heart of these global issues. Here, a planet-proofing approach developed in Africa is presented that illustrates that it is possible to diversify and rehabilitate degraded farmland with species producing highly nutritious and marketable traditional foods in ways that improve food production by conventional staple food crops. Furthermore, it rebuilds agroecological functions and creates new local business opportunities to kick-start rural economies and enhance social well-being. Together, these benefits promote livelihoods and social justice, the mitigation of and/or adaptation to climate change, and the provision of wildlife habitat. This approach offers a highly adaptable model that enhances past investments in the Green Revolution in ways that address both the environmental and social constraints limiting both mainstream agriculture in Africa - and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals globally.

Population parameters were determined for L. conditor from early literature accounts, studies of remnant stick-nests in caves, a three-year study of the last known naturally-occurring populations on the Franklin Islands, records maintained for a captive-breeding program since 1986, and further population data obtained during systematic monitoring of reintroduced populations. Comparable data for L. apicalis could be obtained only from early literature accounts and remnant stick-nests in caves; this species has not been recorded since 1933 and is presumed extinct. Leporillus conditor is a predominantly ground-dwelling, herbivorous rodent of semi-arid, perennial shrubland habitats, which builds nests of interwoven sticks for protection from the elements and from predators. Leporillus apicalis apparently occupied similar habitats, often in sympatry with L. conditor, but extended its range further into the arid zone and may have had a more arboreal life-style and a more diverse diet, including invertebrates. The demise of both species from the mainland was almost certainly due to severe habitat degradation caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before, and leading into, severe drought conditions. The resulting reduction in availability of food and cover also led to an increased vulnerability to predation (primarily by foxes, cats, dingoes and owls). In current L. conditor populations, females reproduce throughout the year and have well-defined home-ranges with relatively small core activity areas. Males have considerably larger home ranges.

Much scholarly attention has focused on how to define urban resilience, in addition to raising questions about its applicability and usefulness. But those debates typically overlook questions of implementation. Implementation is important not only for how cities respond to threats but also because it can influence how urban resilience is perceived, discussed, and understood. The policy literature suggests that implementation is rarely straightforward and has ideological and normative perspectives embedded within it. Building on this literature, this paper argues that urban resilience implementation raises its own conceptual questions for both theory and practice. Further, implementing urban resilience entails its own unique challenges, such as extensive coordination, maintaining adaptability, divergent time horizons, and diverse outcomes. The paper also introduces the idea of resilience resistance as a new challenge for urban resilience. Resistance refers to the condition in which governance systems inherently develop barriers to change, flexibility, and adaptability through implementation.

Likely adaptations of farming systems to meet climate change imperatives are briefly discussed. Collectively it is estimated that regions of New Zealand faced with warmer, wetter conditions under climate change may see an increase in flystrike and cattle tick prevalence, and perhaps an increase in the biting louse, but fewer chorioptic mange and flea infestations. In contrast, drier, warmer regions will possibly experience fewer ectoparasites of all types with the exception of flea infestations.

This will require ""rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities"". The challenge falls on all sectors, especially energy production and industry. In this regard, the recent progress and future challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and energy supply are first briefly introduced. Then, the current situation of the steel industry is presented. Steel production is predicted to grow by 25-30% by 2050. The dominant iron-making route, blast furnace (BF), especially, is an energy-intensive process based on fossil fuel consumption; the steel sector is thus responsible for about 7% of all anthropogenic CO(2)emissions. In order to take up the 2050 challenge, emissions should see significant cuts. Correspondingly, specific emissions (t CO2/t steel) should be radically decreased. Several large research programs in big steelmaking countries and the EU have been carried out over the last 10-15 years or are ongoing. All plausible measures to decrease CO(2)emissions were explored here based on the published literature. The essential results are discussed and concluded. The specific emissions of ""world steel"" are currently at 1.8 t CO2/t steel. Improved energy efficiency by modernizing plants and adopting best available technologies in all process stages could decrease the emissions by 15-20%. Further reductions towards 1.0 t CO2/t steel level are achievable via novel technologies like top gas recycling in BF, oxygen BF, and maximal replacement of coke by biomass. These processes are, however, waiting for substantive industrialization. Generally, substituting hydrogen for carbon in reductants and fuels like natural gas and coke gas can decrease CO(2)emissions remarkably. The same holds for direct reduction processes (DR), which have spread recently, exceeding 100 Mt annual capacity. More radical cut is possible via CO(2)capture and storage (CCS). The technology is well-known in the oil industry; and potential applications in other sectors, including the steel industry, are being explored. While this might be a real solution in propitious circumstances, it is hardly universally applicable in the long run. More auspicious is the concept that aims at utilizing captured carbon in the production of chemicals, food, or fuels e.g., methanol (CCU, CCUS). The basic idea is smart, but in the early phase of its application, the high energy-consumption and costs are disincentives. The potential of hydrogen as a fuel and reductant is well-known, but it has a supporting role in iron metallurgy. In the current fight against climate warming, H(2)has come into the ""limelight"" as a reductant, fuel, and energy storage. The hydrogen economy concept contains both production, storage, distribution, and uses. In ironmaking, several research programs have been launched for hydrogen production and reduction of iron oxides. Another global trend is the transfer from fossil fuel to electricity. ""Green"" electricity generation and hydrogen will be firmly linked together. The electrification of steel production is emphasized upon in this paper as the recycled scrap is estimated to grow from the 30% level to 50% by 2050. Finally, in this review, all means to reduce specific CO(2)emissions have been summarized. By thorough modernization of production facilities and energy systems and by adopting new pioneering methods, ""world steel"" could reach the level of 0.4-0.5 t CO2/t steel and thus reduce two-thirds of current annual emissions.",2020.0,MDPI,Materials Science,A General Vision for Reduction of Energy Consumption and CO(2)Emissions from the Steel Industry,Engineering & technology,Lauri,Lauri,0.25,0.0

Selected previous literature is discussed where relevant in tracing the origins of our current knowledge.Recent FindingsClimate and weather have strong influences on the spatial and temporal distribution of air pollution concentrations. Emissions of ozone and PM2.5 precursors increase at higher ambient temperatures. The reactions that form ozone occur faster with greater sunlight and higher temperatures. Weather systems influence the movement and dispersion of air pollutants in the atmosphere through the action of winds, vertical mixing, and precipitation, all of which are likely to alter in a changing climate. Recent studies indicate that, holding anthropogenic air pollution emissions constant, ozone concentrations in populated regions will tend to increase in future climate scenarios. For the USA, the climate impact on ozone is most consistently seen in north-central and north-eastern states, with the potential for many thousands of additional ozone-related deaths. The sensitivity of anthropogenic PM2.5 to climate is more variable across studies and regions, owing to the varied nature of PM constituents, as well as to less complete characterization of PM reaction chemistry in available atmospheric models. However, PM emitted by wildland fires is likely to become an increasing health risk in many parts of the world as climate continues to change.SummaryThe complex interactions between climate change and air quality imply that future policies to mitigate these twin challenges will benefit from greater coordination.

Three differing sites ('Forest', 'Shrubs' and 'Swamp') under three different seasonal situations (advanced dry season, drought and early rain season), in the mopane woodland of north-eastern Namibia were studied. Methods: Plant water potentials were measured using a pressure chamber in the field. Pre-dawn water potentials were assessed to reflect the soil water potential of the rhizosphere. Midday water potentials were measured to assess the strongest negative water potential by the sample trees. Results: The study reveals significant differences of the water potentials indicated by C. mopane. The different site-vegetation relations specify the impacts of seasonal conditions and site conditions (soil parameters and soil water availability) on the selected species. Conclusions: The investigation reveals a specific adaptation potential of C. mopane in relation to different soil parameter under seasonal conditions. The impact of the different seasons on the pre-dawn plant water potential (indicating actual soil water availability) was assessed independently of other parameters. The adaptation range of C. mopane is obviously reflected by its ability to cope with water stress situations by midday samples.

These studies have typically identified the USA mid-West, much of Europe, the Indo Gangetic Plain in South Asia and the Eastern coastal region of China as global regions where O-3 is likely to threaten food supply and other ecosystems. Global risk assessment modelling estimates yield losses of staple crops between 3 to 16% causing economic losses of between US$14 to 26 billion in the year 2000. Changes in anthropogenic emissions of O-3 precursors in recent decades have modified O-3 concentration profiles (peaks versus background O-3) and global distributions with the Northern Hemisphere seeing increases in O-3 levels of between 1 and 5ppb/decade since the 1950s and the emergence of Asia as the region with the highest O-3 concentrations. In the future, O-3 mitigation could focus on methane (CH4) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions; these will differentially influence global and local/regional O-3 concentrations and influence daily and seasonal profiles. The consequent effects on vegetation will in part depend on how these changes in O-3 profile alter the exceedance of detoxification thresholds for plant damage. Adaptation options may play an important role in enhancing food supply while mitigation strategies are being implemented. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which O-3 affects plants, and how this might influence detoxification thresholds and interactions with other environmental variables such as water stress and nutrients, would help develop O-3 deposition and impact models to support the development of crop, land-surface exchange and ultimately earth system models for holistic assessments of global change.

Based on this, I argue that adaptation initiatives which rest on existing gender inequitable forest management institutions are likely to exacerbate gender-based inequality, further hampering the longer-term socio-ecological resilience. Although gender inequality is not created solely either by forestry institutions or in the institutions designed for climate adaptation, community forestry institutions are increasingly reinforcing the larger patriarchal societal structure that is deeply rooted and manifested in everyday practices. I highlight the need for both forest management and adaptation policies and practices to better recognize, appreciate and address gender inequality. In order to enhance gender-equitable adaptation to climate change, I suggest re-examining and constantly monitoring the changing gender in/equality in the existing forest management institutions and service delivery mechanisms and also adjusting adaptation planning to fully harness the potential of gender equitable forest management and climate change adaptation.",2020.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Development Studies,How do gender relations shape a community's ability to adapt to climate change?

1300,"Moran, Kenneth A.","Sullivan Univ, Coll Business Adm, Louisville, KY 40205 USA.",1.0,"BACKGROUND: Recent changes in the United States (US) economy have radically disrupted revenue generation among many institutions within higher education within the US. Chief among these disruptions has been fallout associated with the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which triggered a change in the US higher education environment from a period of relative munificence to a prolonged period of scarcity. The hardest hit by this disruption have been smaller, less wealthy institutions which tend to lack the necessary reserves to financially weather the economic storm. Interestingly, a review of institutional effectiveness among these institutions revealed that while many are struggling, some institutions have found ways to not only successfully cope with the impact of declining revenue, but have been able to capitalize on the disruption and thrive. OBJECTIVE: Organizational response is an important factor in successfully coping with conditions of organizational decline. The study examined the impacts of organizational response on institutional effectiveness among higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline. The study's research question asked why some US higher educational institutions are more resilient at coping with organizational decline than other institutions operating within the same segment of the higher education sector. More specifically, what role does organizational resilience have in helping smaller, private non-profit institutions cope and remain effective during organizational decline? PARTICIPANTS: A total of 141 US smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions participated in the study; specifically, the study included responses from participant institutions' key administrators. METHODS: 60-item survey evaluated administrator responses corresponding to organizational response and institutional effectiveness. Factor analysis was used to specify the underlying structures of rigidity response, resilience response, and institutional effectiveness. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the direct and interaction effects between organizational decline, organizational rigidity response, organizational resilience response, and institutional effectiveness, controlling for age of institution and level of endowment. RESULTS: The study validated previous threat-rigidity response findings that organizational decline alone does not adversely impact institutional effectiveness. The direct effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking and Role Dependency organizational resilience factors had a positive, significant correlation with the Student Personal Development institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Avoidance during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Diminished Innovation, Morale, and Leader Credibility rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. Lastly, the interactive effect of Increased Scapegoating of Leaders, Interest group Activities, and Conflict rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of organizational resilience were found to have a positive effect among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions associated with this study toward sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline. Specifically, the organizational resilience factors of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking (i.e., mission-driven solutions) and Avoidance (i.e., skepticism toward new ideas) play a significant, collaborative role among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions when it comes to sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline.",2016.0,IOS PRESS,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health","Organizational resilience: Sustained institutional effectiveness among smaller, private, non-profit US higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline",Medicine,Kenneth A.,Kenneth,0.0,0.0

Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one's carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.",2020.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,Psychology,"Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue",Psychology,Steven,Steven,0.0,0.0

Not surprisingly, the islands are subject to many geological hazards, including earthquakes, landslides, and coastal erosion; some selected examples are discussed in this paper. As demonstrated by two recent earthquakes (1980, Terceira; 1998, Faial), the principal damage was related to one or more of these factors: (1) unsafe location of structures near faults; (2) unstable foundation soils; (3) poor quality of building materials and construction methods; (4) disregard of building codes; and (5) lack of building maintenance. Major landsliding events in the Azores (e.g., Ponta da Faja, Ribeira Quente, and Faja dos Cubres) typically are triggered by intense, long-duration precipitation and (or) earthquake-induced ground shaking. The loose, unconsolidated nature of the rocks and soils of these volcanic islands is another significant contributing factor, sometimes aggravated by ground instability caused by human activity. Coastal erosion is prevalent on the north coast of Sao Miguel and the south coast of Faial, mostly resulting from natural circumstances (e.g., steepness of cliffs, differential erosion, intense wave action during storms) and also from human activity (e.g., poorly engineered drainage works on cliff faces). Where severe, coastal erosion can pose a risk to populations and societal infrastructures situated near the tops of the seacliffs. To mitigate the risk of these and other geological hazards in the Azores, it is necessary to (1) prepare hazards and risks maps of the affected areas; (2) adopt prudent land-use planning that considers the hazards; (3) upgrade the building codes in the hazardous areas; (4) initiate slope-stabilization programs; (5) preserve the natural environmental integrity of the regions; and (6) educate the affected populace and governmental officials about the possibilities and consequences of hazardous processes.

Effective early warning systems (EWSs) can reduce the risks posed by these hazards. There have been numerous EWSs set up throughout Africa; however, work out to assess their effectiveness has been limited. This paper covers sub-Saharan Africa using Uganda as a case study. Recently in Uganda there has been a proliferation of EWSs targeted at various beneficiaries. Engagement with a range of stakeholders via an internet-based survey and interviews in Uganda and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa found that EWSs often do not communicate hazards well to vulnerable communities or reduce their impacts at a local level. There are numerous barriers to providing effective warnings. In many sub-Saharan African countries EWSs are not sufficiently budgeted for by the government despite the benefits that can be realised. In Uganda EWSs and the hydro-meteorological networks on which they often rely are underfunded, a situation that is mirrored throughout Africa. This can lead to an absence of confidence in EWSs, meaning that stakeholders do not use formal thresholds to provide triggers for early action. For EWSs in Uganda and the rest of Africa to be effective they need to have not only a strong scientific and technical basis, but also a strong focus on the people at risk and governments need to set aside sufficient funding to ensure that as a minimum their recurrent costs are covered, which currently is not generally the case.",2018.0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,Geology,How can policy makers in sub-Saharan Africa make early warning systems more effective?

The study constructs measures of vulnerability and resilience that are independent of proposed indicators and uses regression analysis to investigate which indicators influence these measures. The analysis finds that (1) middle- and low-income homeowners are less financially resilient than are poorer renters. The recovery cost middle- to low-income homeowners 2.4 times their annual per capita incomes, while renters paid out about half of their per capita incomes. Resilience increases with income but conditional on ownership of assets that are at risk. (2) Disabled and/or chronically ill residents are more vulnerable and less resilient by many outcome measures. (3) Non-white households experience longer disruptions of access to food. (4) Information, hazard-specific capacities of community groups, and pre-hazard access to services such as food and health care are important indicators of vulnerability and resilience.

Using an ethnographic approach, this study examines how a Peruvian indigenous pastoralist community perceived and responded to climate-change induced water threats with the goal of understanding the mechanisms that enable such responses. Pastoralists report that alterations in water availability diminish the size and quality of wetlands and pastures, thus decreasing fodder for their livestock. Their primary adaptive responses are the creation of wetlands and the movement of livestock. A set of nested dynamic and flexible institutions enable households and supra-household units to carry out adaptive responses by facilitating access to alternate grazing areas and the labour force necessary to reshape the landscape. Institutions and local knowledge supporting the responses are open to exogenous information which generates opportunities for collaboration and innovation in the face of water hazards which in turn foments the resilience of indigenous pastoral social-ecological systems. This study reveals how indigenous knowledge and institutions contain strategies for adaptation to water stress that may be scaled up and replicated in national and sub-national programs.",2021.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Development Studies,The role of social institutions in indigenous Andean Pastoralists' adaptation to climate-related water hazards,Interdisciplinary,Julio C.,Julio,0.0,0.0

We examine whether the needs of the poor influence mitigation and adaptation policies in the region. The continent is characterized by an interesting dynamic between inequality and climate change: it is predicted to disproportionately bear the effects of climate change, at the same time that it accounts for four out of the top five countries with the starkest inequality globally. In our analysis, we construct a statistical measure of social inequality for a group of 54 African countries and use the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to obtain corresponding data on mitigation and adaptation policy actions. We then estimate the intensity of the responsiveness of the latter to the former. Using fractional regression and data imputation methods, we find a statistically significant negative relationship between social inequality and climate change policy actions in Africa. Across African countries, mitigation and adaptation actions fall by about 23% for every 1% rise in social inequality. African countries are therefore not responding to climate change threats in ways that simultaneously reduce social inequality and adapt to climate change. Furthermore, there is some evidence that countries emitting more pollutants are less likely to take action to address climate change.

It then draws the economic implications of the expected malaria risk under the future climate. This is accompanied by a discussion on a set of methods that can be used to quantify the economic effects of malaria with or without climate change. Findings A review of available evidence shows that climate change is likely to increase the geographic and seasonal range of malaria incidence in Ethiopia. The economic consequences of even a marginal increase in malaria risk will be substantial as one considers the projected impacts of climate change through other channels, the current population exposed to malaria risk and the country's health system, economic structure and level of investment. The potential effects have the potency to require more household and public spending for health, to perpetuate poverty and inequality and to strain agricultural and regional development.

Drawing upon structured interviews with local government officials, direct observation, semi-structured interviews, and a document review, I demonstrate that while Karamoja has stabilized following a region-wide disarmament, the impacts of climate change, when taken in combination with region-wide changes in land use, have contributed to new forms of localized conflicts including resource-related conflict, theft, and intrahousehold violence. This case, therefore, demonstrates how the cycle of increased vulnerability to climate change due to conflict and increased conflict risk due to low adaptive capacity represents a dangerous and reinforcing feedback loop. Moreover, though climate change is affecting conflict outcomes in Karamoja, those outcomes are far less severe than the region's past, non-climate-related conflicts.

Besides its ecological importance as the residence for various endemic and migratory species,Q. aegilopsforest also has socio-economic values-for example, as fodder for livestock, building material, medicine, charcoal, and firewood. In the KRI,Q. aegilopshas been degrading due to anthropogenic threats (e.g., shifting cultivation, land use/land cover changes, civil war, and inadequate forest management policy) and these threats could increase as climate changes. In the KRI and Iraq as a whole, information on current and potential future geographical distributions ofQ. aegilopsis minimal or not existent. The objectives of this study were to (i) predict the current and future habitat suitability distributions of the species in relation to environmental variables and future climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 2070 and RCP8.5 2070); and (ii) determine the most important environmental variables controlling the distribution of the species in the KRI. The objectives were achieved by using the MaxEnt (maximum entropy) algorithm, available records ofQ. aegilops, and environmental variables. Results: The model demonstrated that, under the RCP2.6 2070 and RCP8.5 2070 climate change scenarios, the distribution ranges ofQ. aegilopswould be reduced by 3.6% (1849.7 km(2)) and 3.16% (1627.1 km(2)), respectively. By contrast, the species ranges would expand by 1.5% (777.0 km(2)) and 1.7% (848.0 km(2)), respectively. The distribution of the species was mainly controlled by annual precipitation. Under future climate change scenarios, the centroid of the distribution would shift toward higher altitudes. Conclusions: The results suggest (i) a significant suitable habitat range of the species will be lost in the KRI due to climate change by 2070 and (ii) the preference of the species for cooler areas (high altitude) with high annual precipitation. Conservation actions should focus on the mountainous areas (e.g., by establishment of national parks and protected areas) of the KRI as climate changes.

The findings further established that IK is mostly used in a situation of long drought season, infestation of diseases and pests for both livestock and crops as well as during occurrence of strong winds. In such circumstances, most oft-cited adaptation practices used include farming and grazing in wetlands, growing of drought resistant crops, using locally made pesticides, and grain storage, to mention but a few.

In response, the signatories of the Paris Agreement (2015) have committed to limit the increase in global mean temperature to <1.5 degrees C from pre-industry period, which is defined as 1850-1890. Considering that the protection of human life is a central focus in the Paris Agreement, the naturally endowed properties of the human body to protect itself from environmental extremes should form the core of an integrated and multifaceted solution against global warming. Scholars believe that heat and thermoregulation played important roles in the evolution of life and continue to be a central mechanism that allows humans to explore, labor and live in extreme conditions. However, the international effort against global warming has focused primarily on protecting the environment and on the reduction of greenhouse gases by changing human behavior, industrial practices and government policies, with limited consideration given to the nature and design of the human thermoregulatory system. Global warming is projected to challenge the limits of human thermoregulation, which can be enhanced by complementing innate human thermo-plasticity with the appropriate behavioral changes and technological innovations. Therefore, the primary aim of this review is to discuss the fundamental concepts and physiology of human thermoregulation as the underlying bases for human adaptation to global warming. Potential strategies to extend human tolerance against environmental heat through behavioral adaptations and technological innovations will also be discussed. An important behavioral adaptation postulated by this review is that sleep/wake cycles would gravitate towards a sub-nocturnal pattern, especially for outdoor activities, to avoid the heat in the day. Technologically, the current concept of air conditioning the space in the room would likely steer towards the concept of targeted body surface cooling.

When states share a water resource, adaptation to climate change proves to be more burdensome, especially if the resource in question is governed by a transboundary water agreement that fails to incorporate flexibility. The focus of this paper is on transboundary water basins with more than two riparian states, where only part of the co-riparian states are party to a transboundary water agreement. The paper discusses whether the recognition of the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water as a principle of customary international law creates an obligation for the party states to such agreements to adapt the terms of their arrangement to climate change. It argues that the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water establishes an obligation of conduct for the states to respect non-parties' riparian rights to a fair share of beneficial uses of water and protect the environment. Therefore, the nature of disruptions caused by climate change may make it imperative for the party states to take all possible measures that allow them to modify their water practices under an agreement to the implications of climate change in order to comply with the principle of equitable and reasonable use of water.",2020.0,IWA PUBLISHING,Water Resources,A legal obligation to adapt transboundary water agreements to climate change?,Geography,Maryam,Maryam,1.0,1.0

The Sustainable Development Goals and the Climate Agenda have placed great emphasis on collaborative frameworks and the private sector's crucial contribution to closing the climate gap in terms of investment and leadership in innovation. However, there has not been a concise follow-up and assessment of the private sector's practical involvement and contribution, whether policy and legislative frameworks and planning approaches are suitable to enable this involvement, and who would lead in delivering the climate agenda locally. The present article addresses this gap reporting on case observations regarding the delivery of climate interest and sustainability through urban development in London and Copenhagen-two European cities of different sizes and varying government approaches. Thereby, the article assesses patterns of private-sector involvement and governance around climate adaptation and mitigation and locates gaps around its involvement in delivering the climate agenda. The analysis clarifies overarching differences in governance and frameworks for the involvement of the private sector between the two cities, attributing this on the local level partly to city size and scale, but to a great extent to 'city leadership' in the built environment and sustainable urban innovation in general. A crucial finding highlights the importance that cities further establish platforms for collaborative learning, specifically around pilot urban projects, thereby stimulating voluntary private engagement. Another key finding is in the potential effectiveness of strategies by public agencies such as city governments to incentivise private actors and simultaneously monitor sustainability effects both broadly at the city level, and specifically at urban project level using ecological, circular and life-cycle approaches. Further implications of the analysis point to the importance of developing a more nuanced approach to understanding the different roles fulfilled by the 'private sector' in the built environment and the necessity of creating an information base addressing the life cycle of development projects and business processes and comparing their impacts. The situation also necessitates considering efforts, impacts, climate finances and data on the broad city scale. The findings of this article can inspire further research, benefit further action in these cities and inform international efforts about climate gaps related to climate adaptation and mitigation.",2020.0,MDPI,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Understanding Private-Sector Engagement in Sustainable Urban Development and Delivering the Climate Agenda in Northwestern Europe-A Case Study of London and Copenhagen,Interdisciplinary,Roudaina,Roudaina,,

This study recognizes that journalism has a very crucial role in many aspects of sustainable development in Pakistan, ranging from facilitation of good governance to social cohesion, peace, public participation, empowerment and inclusion. For this purpose, journalists need freedom of expression and require unrestrained access to information. However, Pakistani journalists often confront legal and other restrictions to practicing these two rights, resulting in a lack of their ability to report on critical issues especially relevant to sustainable development. Therefore, drawing on the development communication theory, this study identifies the areas of sustainable development that are reported most by Pakistani journalists.

The methodology combines critical discourse analysis and corpus techniques to analyse a total of 18 campaigns in different temporal, geographical and political contexts. EMW's discourse issued at European level is used as the reference corpus to examine how cities reframe their discourse by weakening or strengthening two governance modes characterised as an action-taking approach that focuses on the steering role of government, and a decision-making approach that highlights the city's interdependencies in a societal context. Learning more about discourse as a vindicator of governance modes in urban climate governance can contribute to a better understanding of how climate transitions are actually put into practise.

Thus, a climate change risk assessment was conducted for both the water and heat wave risks via discussions with key stakeholders. The risk assessment was conducted as a survey based on expert assessment of local conditions, with awareness surveys taken by residents, especially women. The assessment determined that the lack of drinking water was the biggest issue, a problem that has become more serious due to recent droughts caused by climate change and insufficient water management. In addition, the outbreak of diseases caused by heat waves was identified as a serious concern. Risk assessment is integral to developing an action plan for minimizing the damage from climate change.

The novelty of the study is to use the spatial boundary discontinuities along floodplains as a way to control unobserved spatial heterogeneities in a regression analysis framework. Using parcel-level data from Lancaster County (Pennsylvania, USA), we show that cropland is more vulnerable to potential flood risk compared to noncrop farmland. Specifically, cropland parcels on average experience a 13% (or $3,895/acre in 2015 USD, with the 95% confidence interval being [$510, $7352]) value reduction if exposed to a 1% or higher annual chance of flooding. The flood risk impact on noncrop farmland is statistically insignificant.

For the breeder, a genetic map saturated with molecular markers allows selection for certain characters to be carried out much more efficiently and effectively than was possible previously. Two areas of molecular marker technology that are proving particularly useful in identifying traits of value for stress resistance and introducing them into improved varieties are in situ hybridization with fluorescent-labelled molecular probes and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis with either radioactively- or cold-labelled probes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) takes out much of the cytological tedium previously associated with monitoring the introgression of chromosomes and DNA fragments from one species to another. Labelled DNA can be prepared that is specific to a particular species and used to visualize in chromosome preparations the presence of chromosomes or chromosomal fragments from that species amongst the recipient's chromosomes. This is being used to help transfer genes for drought resistance and salt tolerance from alien species into Graminaceous crops. DNA probes showing polymorphism between the donor and recipient species can also be used to monitor the incorporation of alien genes from chromosome addition lines into the recipient species. High density molecular maps allow the location of all major genes regulating the expression of a particular trait to be determined. Statistical methods have been developed to allow QTL for the trait to be identified. Not only does this allow the complexity of genetic control of any trait to be determined, but by comparing the extent to which confidence intervals of QTL for different traits overlap it is possible to examine the likelihood that traits are pleiotropically linked. Thus, the traits most likely to be important in determining yield under droughted conditions can be identified.

Land reclamation drove island expansion on 93.5 % of inhabited islands, whereas land reclamation and/or the effects of engineered structures (especially groins and breakwaters) were involved in 79.2 % of the resort islands. Almost 52 % of the islands that increased in size experienced growth rates >= 10 %, with 13 inhabited and 6 resort islands exhibiting growth rates >= 50 %.

This manuscript is inspired by the following research question: To what extent are gender positive' processes and projects associated with solar development in India realized on the ground? Utilizing mixed methods fieldwork and drawing on literature from feminist political ecology, this paper demonstrates how the modalities of solar park development represent an antinomy of a nature-society relation. New configurations of labor under the political economy of solar have produced a gendered surplus population of landless peasants who are not absorbed into wage-labor employment in the solar park. Further, associated social development schemes actually disempower women, despite mandates of 'gender positive' outcomes by UN-based climate treaties to which this project is beholden. The opportunity to participate in one such scheme for female empowerment was reserved for only women of middle-to-high class status and those of dominant castes, thereby reproducing class and caste-based social power asymmetries.

Cerrado plants are, therefore, adapted to fire and some of them depend on fire to maintain their reproduction and survival.

Although this decision was effective in protecting tropical forests, the zero-fire policy has been quite negative in the Cerrado. Fire suppression in Cerrado reserves has caused a dramatic loss of biodiversity at landscape level (homogenizing the vegetation structure), at species level (leading non-tree species to local extinction) and likely at population level (sexual reproduction impaired). Furthermore, fuel accumulation over several years without fire increases the risks of catastrophic firestorms that will inevitably occur. Such negative consequences of fire suppression in the Cerrado have not been noticed even among ecologists, including myself in early career and until recently.

The situation will worsen due to climate change. Regardless of the cause that generated the salinity, i.e., whether primary or secondary, the effect of soil salinization on plant growth and on living organisms will be severe. To mitigate such impacts, several studies have been carried out over the years with the aim of providing technical or management solutions to deal with the multiple consequences of soil salinity. A review by Cuevas et al. proposes a new approach looking for solutions through soil-improving cropping systems (SICSs). The SICSs have to prevent, mitigate or remediate the negative impacts of soil salinization. The efforts of Cuevas et al. were to organize the analyses by focusing on SICSs that would: (1) prevent or halt secondary salinization; (2) cope with salinization; (3) reverse salinization. The study is concluded by an effort to assess the impacts of each SICS and of the combined SICSs application in terms of agronomic, economic, and environmental aspects. Both economic constraints and the collective willingness of stakeholders to innovate are taken into in the evaluation of feasibility. It is important to put into practice and/or identify a number of sustainable actions, at low environmental input, to improve crop tolerance to water deficit and high salinity as well as to preserve biodiversity and mitigate the impact of climate changes. At the same time, these actions would ensure crop productivity in the area, thus guaranteeing environment and social benefits to the local population, and thus weakening the motivation to abandon the land.

Such insights are critical for understanding how climate change policy will expand, play out, and evolve as it moves from experimental efforts in particularly innovative cities to the majority of cities. This study addresses these needs using 32 interviews and over 200 survey responses from smaller cities (populations under 100,000) in the American rust belt. In the interviews comparing cities' financial concerns, economic development considerations, and how other cities influence them, a distinctive mindset amongst cities highly engaged with climate change emerged. Highly engaged cities were those pursuing socioeconomic reinvention, informed by efforts to identify and apply policy ideas from a wide range of other cities across the United States and internationally. Results of the regression analyses supported the notion that financial concerns, economic development considerations, and the influence of other cities shape decisions about climate change policy in these cities. However, they also highlighted the complexity of these issues and that the role these factors had in shaping climate change policy will likely continue to evolve as these policies continue to diffuse to more places.",2020.0,MDPI,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Socioeconomic Reinvention and Expanding Engagement with Climate Change Policy in American Rust Belt Cities,Environmental studies & forestry,Scott E.,Scott,0.0,0.0

The current monitoring of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is mainly based on reproduction number (R-0) and fatality rates. However, this approach is a real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics for mitigating the numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. Reproduction number does not provide information to cope with future epidemics or pandemics. The main goal of this study is to propose the Index c (as contagions) that quantifies, ex-ante, the environmental risk of exposure of cities/regions to future epidemics of the COVID-19 and similar vital agents. This Index c synthetizes environmental, demographic, climatological and health risk factors of cities/regions that indicate their exposure to infectious diseases. Index c has a range from 1 (environmental and social weakness of urban areas leading to high levels of exposure to infectious diseases) to 0 (environment that reduces the risk of exposure to infectious diseases in society). The statistical evidence here, applied on case study of Italy, seems in general to support the predictive capacity of the Index c as a particularly simple but superior indicator in detecting the global correlation between potential risk of exposure of cities/regions to infectious diseases and actual risk given by infected individuals and deaths of the COVID-19.

There are great expectations from authorities and researchers that marine bioprospecting can have major effects on future economies, through innovations that would lead to producing medicine as well as food, fodder, cosmetics and other products. Vital to this process are questions regarding rights to access, collect and utilise resources, and the sharing of costs and benefits, which are potentially high at both ends of this spectrum. Currently, a state driven process aims to better regulate and control bioprospecting within areas under Norwegian jurisdiction. The present paper examines the challenging process of establishing such regulatory framework where actors struggle to gain discursive hegemony by obtaining legal backing for claims to genetic resources in the Norwegian littoral. Four discursive arguments are discerned and it is argued that knowledge and understanding about these discursive processes is of vital importance when policies for the future bioeconomy are shaped.

Farm gate prices in Russia range from euro 0.10/kg for industrial grade to almost euro 1/kg for class I apple fruit (65-75 mm). These new apple orchards are planted with mostly international cvs 'Gala', 'Elstar', 'Granny Smith', 'Golden Delicious', 'Enterprise', 'Jeromine', 'Braeburn', whereas the traditional aromatic Russian varieties 'Reinette Simirenko' and 'Antonovka' remain as a specialty in private gardens. Commercial production is on a 3-wire-trellis under black hail net supported by regionally-produced concrete posts. In the favourable growing conditions of the Northern Caucasus region, the soil is often a fertile black chernosem, spring water is available from the Caucasus mountains for drip irrigation and cool nights to provide sufficient fruit colouration in the autumn, but sunburn is still problematic in orchards without hail net.

Adverse climate change would thus have detrimental impacts on agriculture. The regional climate change impact studies have biased to hydrological aspects with very limited ones on the agricultural impacts which were even carried out either within a larger scale or a country-based one. This study made the use of the daily temperature outputs of two regional climate models (RCMs), namely the CCCma-CanESM2 and the CSIRO-MK3, for estimating changes in the growing degree days (GDDs) under the worst climate change scenario (RCP 8.5) for the period 2040-2050. The baseline datasets (1960-1990) were obtained from the Climate Research Unit. The analysis was being carried out in R and QGIS software. Results showed that changes in the minimum temperature (3.0 degrees C) exceed that of the maximum temperature (2.65 degrees C) relative to the baseline. The performance of RCMs in reproducing the regional variability in temperature is a seasonal dependent, with a slightly better performance of the SCIRO-Mk3 compared to the CCCma-CanESM2. The GDDS of winter wheat (November-April) and sorghum (May-October) were increased by 9% and 35%, respectively, due to global warming. Also, the regional climatological suitable areas of winter wheat showed decreasing and increasing trends, depending on the RCM, contrasting the pure decreasing trend in the areas of sorghum of -8.5%. Consequently, the region experiences delays in sowing dates and shortened season lengths.

The study finds that there has been high procedural compliance by financial institutions through developing sustainable finance action plans and submitting annual sustainability reports to the financial regulator. However, there is considerable variation and inconsistency in interpreting what constitutes a 'green' project among financial institutions, enabling some financial institutions to engage in little more than tokenism. With the limited regulatory oversight currently provided, it is difficult to see how financial institutions might be incentivised to do more or how tangible sustainability outcomes can be achieved.

Individuals rely on environmental cues to regulate hormonal mechanisms governing timing of breeding. Historically, studies on physiological mechanisms of seasonal reproduction, specifically in birds, have disproportionately focused on males compared to females. For this review, I conducted a literature search of the last decade of avian research and found a persistent sex bias in the field of physiological mechanisms of seasonal reproduction. Using work conducted with the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) as a case study, I present a possible solution to combat the sex bias: natural comparisons of populations that differ in reproductive timing to investigate mechanisms of reproduction in both sexes. Populations of dark-eyed juncos that differ in migratory behavior (i.e., migrant and resident) exhibit overlapping ranges during winter and early spring; residents begin breeding in early spring prior to the departure of migrants. This system, and others like it, provides an opportunity to compare mechanisms of reproduction in populations that differ in reproductive timing despite experiencing the same environmental conditions in early spring. In juncos, migrant and resident females and males exhibit similar patterns of hypothalamic regulation of reproduction in early spring, but sex differences in gonadal sensitivity between the populations could be an important distinction that partially explains sex differences in reproductive development. Comparing mechanisms of reproduction in free-living populations and in captivity can reveal important mechanisms that determine the onset of reproductive development, as well as potential sex differences in these mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms of reproductive phenology has important implications for understanding how species will survive and reproduce in a changing climate.",2020.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,Zoology,Females as the Gatekeepers to Seasonal Breeding: What We Can Learn by Studying Reproductive Mechanisms in Both Sexes,Biology,Abigail A.,Abigail,1.0,1.0

The need for devolution in the context of disaster risk reduction (DRR) is even more critical owing to the fact that it has potential to improve governance which can influence the meaningful engagement of communities at-risk in planning. This paper adopts a diagnostic approach on investigating the extent devolution is augmenting DRR as well as adaptation to climate change adaptation (CCA) in five arid counties in Kenya over the 2014-2018 period. The analysis shows that county DRR policy frameworks are at various stages of development, DRR is increasingly being institutionalized and it has been integrated into County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs). A number of challenges noted in the implementation of DRR include inadequate funds, weak coordination mechanisms, few and poorly trained personnel, insufficient engagement of the vulnerable persons and low commitment from county policy makers. The policies being developed were also found to be poorly aligned to the national and Sendai framework while the DRR and CCA responsible institutions operate asymmetrically. The study recommends greater commitment in mainstreaming DRR and adaptation into entire county planning processes and capacitating the institutions to support risk - informed planning.

Hybrid corals, or a mix of two different coral species, are in some cases more resilient to climate change and other stressors than their parent species. However, hybrid corals, like many species around the world, are threatened by human activity. A suite of international, federal, state, and local laws purport to protect endangered and threatened species, including corals. Unfortunately, these laws, notably the U.S. Endangered Species Act, do not protect hybrid species.

Design/methodology/approach This paper is derived from a toolkit that was produced for Oxfam Australia. Disasters and climate change are major drivers of poverty and significantly affect the communities that development programs of Oxfam Australia aim to assist. Recognising the importance of building its organisational capacity to address these risks, Oxfam Australia initiated and commissioned the production of a PCVA toolkit to support disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation programs; the production of the toolkit was led by the author. The methodology of producing the toolkit consisted of discussions with experts and a review of similar toolkits. Findings Details of the PCVA process and how to conduct one in a community setting are provided including PCVA concepts, briefing, logistics and management and principles of working with communities. Importantly, the different stages of conducting a PCVA are explained, and some selected tools are presented as illustrative examples. In conclusion, the importance of the PCVA considerations and principles are reaffirmed vis-a-vis the sensitivity and soft skills required in a low-income developing country setting. Originality/value The participatory development approach, which the toolkit follows, has been widely advocated for the past few decades and most non-governmental organisations involved in community development espouse this approach. Consequently, a wide range of participatory development toolkits have been developed, many of which relate to disasters and climate change. The PCVA toolkit discussed in this paper draws on the repertoire of toolkits already available and used over a long time. Nonetheless, effort was given to assembling a range of tools that were most suitable for the purpose of this particular PCVA toolkit. Instead of focussing on the tools, which are available from the freely downloadable toolkit and available in the public domain, in this paper, the PCVA process and its main principles are explained, and the key considerations to carry out an effective PCVA is discussed. Perhaps even more than the actual tools, these considerations and an understanding of the PCVA principles are significant because they underpin the utilisation of the toolkit.",2021.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Considerations and principles for conducting a participatory capacity and vulnerability analysis (PCVA) for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation,Environmental studies & forestry,Iftekhar,Iftekhar,0.0,0.0

Therefore, innovation in plant breeding has gained unprecedented importance. Plant breeding depends upon genetic variability within crops and their relatives as a basis for developing new plant varieties with improved characteristics. Plant breeders are continuously integrating the latest methods in plant biology and genetics into their breeding toolbox to more efficiently use existing diversity but also to induce new genetic variation. Over the past years, ever more precise and efficient plant breeding methods have been developed. This plant breeding innovation leap is based on an in-depth understanding of plant genomes and refinement of breeding methods, enabling more efficient, more precise and faster progress in achieving the desired breeding goals. Consequently, these plant breeding innovations are rapidly being developed and utilized internationally and across the seed sector, public and private research, plant species and markets. The results of a survey among 62 private plant breeding companies conducted by Euroseeds and presented in this publication confirm the enormous interest of companies in using new breeding techniques (NBTs) for a wide range of crop species and traits and the negative impact of the current regulatory situation in the EU on companies' decisions for investments in NBT-related R&D activities for the EU market and beyond.",2020.0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,Plant Sciences,"Potential, Challenges, and Threats for the Application of New Breeding Techniques by the Private Plant Breeding Sector in the EU",Biology,Petra,Petra,1.0,1.0

This article addresses this neglect by presenting three brief case studies of such NGOs. It derives from these cases a typology of negotiating support NGOs to illustrate their variance in terms of the 'range' of issues supported and the 'scale' of support provided to developing countries, whilst providing directions for future research.

Range professionals perceive, however, that many Utah ranchers remain ill-equipped for drought. The main research objective was to determine why ranchers often don't adopt recommended drought-mitigation tactics. Another objective was to clarify how grazing is managed during drought on federal lands. Fourteen tactics studied included management of water, forage, herds, and finances and access to information and government programs. Data collection included surveys of 429 ranchers and interviews of seven federal employees. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Results indicated that 3,133 non-adoption decisions were heavily dominated by the perceived incompatibility between tactics and operational needs; producer situations may often be misunderstood by experts. Weather forecasting tools were typically regarded by ranchers as ""too complex,"" while Extension information was often viewed as ""not useful."" Factors promoting drought preparedness included having a strong livestock-business orientation or a drought-planning mentality. Factors hindering drought preparedness were dominated by advancing rancher age. Grazing permittees benefit from federal drought early-warning systems, yet herd adjustments on allotments were rare during the 2019 drought, pushing forage utilization to the limits. While challenges appear daunting, there are opportunities to enhance drought preparedness, prominently including creative efforts to promote more education and mentoring on operational drought management. Comprehensive, user-friendly drought websites remain rare, yet they can be vital hubs for stakeholders. Such websites must meet diverse communication needs including a greater focus on information requirements of seniors. Drought policies for ranchers should: (1) Eliminate perverse incentives that foster inappropriate risk taking; (2) reward pro-active, risk-management behaviors; and (3) facilitate recruitment of a younger, innovative cohort of new producers. Updating federal management plans could support grazing adjustments that incorporate more grass banking. Unified drought-response guidelines could harmonize agency approaches.

Practical experience and research results of recent years have showed that our actions to cover the gap between real situation and aims of climate agreements are not enough and that improvements in climate policy are needed, primarily in the energy sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that hydrocarbon resources, which production volume is increasing annually, will remain a significant part of the global fuel balance in the foreseeable future. Taking this into account, the main problem of the current climate policy is a limited portfolio of technologies, focused on replacement of hydrocarbon resources with renewable energy, without proper attention to an alternative ways of decreasing carbon intensity, such as carbon sequestration options. This study shows the need to review the existing climate policy portfolios through reorientation to CO2 utilization and disposal technologies and in terms of forming an appropriate appreciation for the role of hydrocarbon industries as the basis for the development of CO2-based production chains. In this paper we argue that: (1) focusing climate investments on a limited portfolio of energy technologies may become a trap that keeps us from achieving global emissions goals; (2) accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions losses, without taking into account the potential social effects of utilization, is a barrier to diversifying climate strategies; (3) with regard to hydrocarbon industries, a transition from destructive to creative measures aimed at implementing environmental projects is needed; (4) there are no cheap climate solutions, but the present cost of reducing CO2 emissions exceeds any estimate of the social cost of carbon.",2021.0,MDPI,Energy & Fuels,Climate Policy Imbalance in the Energy Sector: Time to Focus on the Value of CO2 Utilization,Physics,Pavel,Pavel,0.0,0.0

Arrangements that do not entail working on, or being led by, an agenda set by those in capacity needs are not, by definition, capacity mobilization or capacity building efforts. It is argued that capacity is tied to self-reliance and self-determination and thus ability to set and pursue the recipient's own agenda must be at the core of development narratives. Key policy insights Self-reliance and self-determination are at the core of capacity development. Therefore, countries need to set and pursue their own agenda by creating and following a bottom-up and inclusive development narrative.

Unfortunately, Texas provides a perfect illustration of these forces, with impacts made even more severe by a lack of climate planning. How can planners minimize harm and reduce risk, given the state leadership's unwillingness to undertake climate planning? One place to start is to investigate residents' climate change beliefs to understand whether they share the state's climate antagonism and then use this information to shape a planning response. In this study, I analyzed a survey (n = 1,053) to ask: What are Texans' perceptions of climate change, and how can planners use this knowledge to create strategies to catalyze climate planning? Respondents expressed strong agreement about negative effects of climate change and increased frequency of extreme weather. They believed that climate change is due at least in part to human activity, and they expressed robust support for climate-related planning activities. These responses sharply differ from the state's approach. However, despite agreement about climate issues, respondents did not identify climate change as a major concern about the future. This contrast suggests an opportunity for new climate-related communication frames to bridge the gap between climate perceptions and planning action. Takeaway for practice These findings inform three recommendations: better connect climate change impacts to everyday concerns, including housing, air quality, and health; emphasize common ground about benefits provided by nature, especially related to health; and use community engagement to refine these frames. I propose that planners can accelerate climate planning by following the lead of other disciplines that emphasize human health impacts of the climate crisis.

The progress moves further to achieve green economic efficiency (GEE) to achieve economic, social, and environmental development. One of the major challenges has been promulgating and strictly implementing environmental regulations and policies vis-a-vis green growth and development. China, having the second largest economy, has started its voyage to achieve GEE. However, there are multiple challenges on the way to the green economy. The objective of the present stud is to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China using fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision analysis. To serve this purpose, the study identifies 5 alternative strategies to achieve GEE while considering 10 criteria and 48 sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been employed to rank criteria and sub-criteria to the goal. The Fuzzy VIekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) method has been used to rank the alternative strategies of GEE.

It has been established that managers' personal values are critical for their behavior and that threats to these values can mobilize managers to change their actions. However, when confronted with environment-related threats, managers may face value conflicts and various tensions between their aim to implement sustainable changes and their desire to fulfill business requirements of their job positions. Only recently have researchers begun to investigate the underlying beliefs that may lead managers to initiate organizational change toward sustainability. Borrowing theoretical assumptions from the domain of health psychology (from the well-established health belief model), the present conceptual article develops an environmental belief model that specifies when exactly threats lead managers to initiate organizational change. The environmental belief model proposes that environment-related threats trigger change (i) when managers believe that their firms are susceptible to these threats, (ii) the threats are considered as serious for the company, (iii) the perceived benefits of the change outperform (iv) the perceived barriers, and when there is (v) an external cue (e.g., an information campaign). All these propositions are supported with empirical findings from business contexts.

Silver birch is an excellent model system for the adaptation of northern trees to climate change due to recent advances in genomics, high genetic variation, and intensive studies with different abiotic and biotic stress factors. In this paper, the current understanding about the responses and acclimation mechanisms of birch to changing environment is presented, based on Fennoscandian studies. Several complementary experiments in laboratory, semi-field and natural field conditions have shown that warming climate and increasing CO2 is expected to increase the growth and biomass of birch, but the risk of herbivore damage will increase with negative impact on carbon sink strength. Deleterious impacts of high humidity, soil drought and increasing ozone has been clearly demonstrated. All these environmental changes have led to metabolic shifts or changes in carbon/nutrient balance which may have further ecological impacts.

The framework was based on a proposal from the All Party Committee on Environmental Objectives (the Committee), in which members from all participating parliamentary parties agreed unanimously. This was despite a contested climate debate running in parallel, notwithstanding strong criticism from business confederations and trade unions. Aiming to draw lessons of value for climate policy-making, this study explores the main factors that influenced the work and outcomes of the Committee, based on a series of in-depth interviews and document review. The research design is linked to policy process theories. The interviews mainly concern underlying motives, the role of knowledge, the influence of impact assessments, and international influence. It is shown that a continuous and comprehensive learning process in the Committee was instrumental for achieving consensus, including addressing concerns among some members regarding policy costs and constitutionality. The Committee was also influenced by policy developments elsewhere, referred to as policy diffusion, notably from the U.K. Climate Change Act and the UNFCCC COP 21 policy process. Over time, a cross-party consensus among Committee members emerged and led to the invention of an original policy proposal. The consensus was instrumental for generating support for the proposal in an otherwise conflictual political landscape. As a result, a governmental bill based on the proposal was eventually enacted into law, renewing Sweden's climate policy with a climate change act coupled to ambitious climate objectives. Key policy insights Joint learning on factually complex and normatively contested climate issues requires time and comprehensive processes but can lead to policy inventions and ambitious outcomes. Policy diffusion between countries may be important for raising ambitions and shaping innovative, new elements of national climate policy. Framework climate change acts and specific climate laws can be mutually supportive, i.e. frameworks foster more ambitious sectoral laws and the more precise sectoral laws, the easier it is to agree on stricter overall ambitions.

Its authoritative reports provide cultural resources for public understanding on the challenge of climate change. While the IPCC maintains its perception as a policy-neutral adviser, the IPCC in practice acts as a powerful discursive agent that guides policy debates in a certain direction by enacting influential scientific concepts. These concepts include three prominent metaphors-temperature threshold, carbon budget and climate deadline-that have been widely circulated across science, policy and advocacy. Three metaphors differ on ways in which the risk of climate change is expressed in terms of space and time. But they all constitute the discourse of climate scarcity-the cognitive view of that we have (too) little space and time to stay below a physical limit for avoiding dangerous climate change. This discursive construction of physical scarcity on climate change has significant political and psychological implications. Politically, the scarcity discourse has the risk of increasing a post-political tendency towards managerial control of the global climate ('scarcity of politics'). Psychologically, however, scarcity has a greater risk of generating a 'scarcity mindset' that inhibits our cognitive capacity to imagine human life beyond managing physical scarcity. Under a narrow mindset of scarcity, the future is closed down to the 'point of no return' that, if crossed, is destined to be the end. To go beyond the scarcity discourse, a new discourse of emancipation has to be fostered. Climate change can be reframed not as a common single destination but as a predicament for actively reimagining human life.

Recent projections show that drought events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. According to studies conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 83% of all damages and losses caused globally by drought between 2006 and 2016 have been absorbed by agriculture, putting a large part of the world's population at risk of food insecurity. This study shows the advantage of scaling-up FAO's agricultural drought monitoring and early warning system (ASIS) and building the bridge with the anticipatory action, drought financial mechanisms, social protection and other initiatives for preventing the deterioration of food security and strengthening resilience. The results of the methodology that is based on and supported by the digital innovation, machine learning, matured knowledge and experiences accumulated over the past 10 years are illustrated with practical examples from different countries, ecological environments and crops. A fused time series of Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data from Meteorological Operational satellite (METOP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was used to produce a consistent time series of a vegetation health index (VHI) at 1 km spatial resolution from 1984 to present. VHI is multiplied by the crop coefficient (kc) to provide more responsiveness to the VHI anomaly that occurs during sensitive phenological phases to water stress such as a flowering and grain filling. The weighted VHI (wVHI) is integrated from the start of the season (SOS) up to the end of season (EOS). Once the temporal analysis of wVHI is completed, the spatial average is calculated using the values of pixels within a specific crop mask and administrative unit. The system proposed different vegetation indices to assess the impact of drought in agriculture; including an agricultural drought forecast that provide more time to the decision makers for implementing anticipatory actions to mitigate the drought in agriculture.

Projections expect massive climate-related migration in this century. Nascent research calls to study health, migration, population, and armed conflict potential together, accounting for EICC and other factors. System science offers a way: develop a dynamic simulation model (DSM). We aim to validate the feasibility and usefulness of a pilot DSM intended to serve as a proof-of-concept and a basis for identifying model extensions to make it less simplified and more realistic. Methods Studies have separately examined essential parts. Our DSM integrates their results and computes composites of health problems (HP), health care (HC), non-EICC environmental health problems (EP), and environmental health services (ES) by origin site and by immigrants and natives in a destination site, and conflict risk and intensity per area. The exogenous variables include composites of EICC, sociopolitical, economic, and other factors. We simulate the model for synthetic input values and conduct sensitivity analyses. Results The simulation results refer to generic origin and destination sites anywhere on Earth. The effects' sizes are likely inaccurate from a real-world view, as our input values are synthetic. Their signs and dynamics are plausible, internally consistent, and, like the sizes, respond logically in sensitivity analyses. Climate migration may harm public health in a host area even with perfect HC/ES qualities and full access; and no HP spillovers across groups, conflict, EICC, and EP. Deviations from these conditions may worsen everyone's health. We consider adaptation options.

Pakistan is facing severe crises of changing climate and it is ranked one of the most vulnerable countries due to climate change. Adaptation to climate change is the main strategy of Pakistan to deal with climatic impacts. Implementing the GBI plays a key role in urban areas for promoting adaptive governance towards climate change. Many efforts have been initiated to manage the issue of climate change by the national, provincial, and local governments in Pakistan. The latest and notable strategy by Pakistani government was devised in the form of the Clean Green Pakistan Strategy (CGPS) to promote the GBI as adaptation strategy to address climate change. However, there are multiple challenges and hurdles for effective implementation of the CGPS. On the heels of Paris Agreement 2015, the CSOs have growing role to overcome such challenges and to prepare the local communities in collaboration with local institutions especially in cities for advancing the GBI and tackling climate change effectively. This study is conducted to understand and uncover the role of the CSOs for promoting the GBI as adaptive strategy in dealing with climate change in Islamabad city of Pakistan. The study focuses to investigate and dig out the prominent initiatives of the CSOs towards the GBI in Pakistani governance system. It also identifies the hurdles and challenges for the CSOs in relation to promote the GBI in Pakistan. A case study approach as research methodology is employed where semistructured interviews were conducted with relevant actors in Islamabad city. The study finds that the CSOs are actively involved in promotion of the GBI in collaboration with Islamabad administration through plantation drive, educating school students on the GBI, arranging training programs for the local community, providing advocacy assistance and helping the city government for establishing policies and action plans for the GBI. The CSOs act as representative of the local community in devising the GBI policies and implementation actions at local scale through consistent engagements with the local administration and the local community in the city. The CSOs have emerged as a mediator in aligning intergovernmental relations for implementing the GBI as the CSOs are closely working with local, provincial, and federal institutions, thus they are key for all tiers of the government. The major challenges faced by the CSOs are identified: weak linkage and cooperation among local and international organizations, limited financial resources, and weak capacity of local organizations.

In the past, farmers usually followed the rule of thumb to grow crops; however, due to the dramatic climate change, it becomes harder for farmers to cope with it by merely following the rule of thumb, which leads to crop damage. Therefore, it is vital to input scientific data development and technology for optimizing the environment parameters of crops and further enhance the yields. Additionally, many farms need to spread pesticides to avoid pests and diseases; yet, too much pesticide may cause soil alkalization. To enrich the growing-power of the lands, farmers will fertilize the lands; nevertheless, too much of it will also cause soil acidification, which will need to leave the land fallow to improve the soil quality.

The adverse effects of climate change have just begun to be experienced in Turkey's spring and the winter wheat zones. However, climate change is likely to affect the winter wheat zone more severely. Fortunately, there is a fast, repeatable, reliable and relatively affordable way to predict climate change effects on winter wheat (e.g., testing winter wheat in the spring wheat zone). For this purpose, 36 wheat genotypes in total, consisting of 14 spring and 22 winter types, were tested under the field conditions of the Southeastern Anatolia Region, a representative of the spring wheat zone of Turkey, during the two cropping seasons (2017-2018 and 2019-2020). Simultaneous heat (>30 degrees C) and drought (<40 mm) stresses occurring in May and June during both growing seasons caused drastic losses in winter wheat grain yield and its components. Declines in plant characteristics of winter wheat genotypes, compared to those of spring wheat genotypes using as a control treatment, were determined as follows: 46.3% in grain yield, 23.7% in harvest index, 30.5% in grains per spike and 19.4% in thousand kernel weight, whereas an increase of 282.2% in spike sterility occurred. On the other hand, no substantial changes were observed in plant height (10 cm longer than that of spring wheat) and on days to heading (25 days more than that of spring wheat) of winter wheat genotypes. In general, taller winter wheat genotypes tended to lodge. Meanwhile, it became impossible to avoid the combined effects of heat and drought stresses during anthesis and grain filling periods because the time to heading of winter wheat genotypes could not be shortened significantly. In conclusion, our research findings showed that many winter wheat genotypes would not successfully adapt to climate change. It was determined that specific plant characteristics such as vernalization requirement, photoperiod sensitivity, long phenological duration (lack of earliness per se) and vulnerability to diseases prevailing in the spring wheat zone, made winter wheat difficult to adapt to climate change. The most important strategic step that can be taken to overcome these challenges is that Turkey's wheat breeding program objectives should be harmonized with the climate change scenarios.",2021.0,MDPI,Agriculture,Winter Wheat Adaptation to Climate Change in Turkey,Agriculture,Yuksel,Yuksel,0.0,0.0

One of the difficulties of evaluating the potential efficacy and impact of nature-based solutions is that it is believed that there is little evidence by way of a precedent or long-term successful examples. Much literature exists on the subject of designing with nature to provide multi-functional green infrastructure, connectivity in the landscape, and ecosystem service provision. Indeed, in the opinion of many, the nature-based solution approach appears to synergise research into green infrastructure, ecological connectivity and ecosystem service provision for building climate-related resilience. However, when a nature-based solution has been specifically selected over, say, an engineered solution the literature is rather less clear. So, decision-makers may find it necessary to rely on less reliable sources of impact evidence. This paper argues that field boundary hedgerows may be considered to be exemplars of a nature-based solution, one that was planned, designed, perfected and mainstreamed at a landscape scale, that was specifically selected over a non-nature-based solution, and one that is still in providing solutions and co-benefits today.

Homeowners in the United States and in much of Europe can purchase flood insurance. The Netherlands and Asian countries generally do not offer flood insurance protection to homeowners. Uninsured households incur the entire cost of repairing/replacing properties damaged due to flooding. Homeowners' policies do not cover damage caused by flooding. The paper examines the link between personal bankruptcy and the severity of flooding events, property prices and financial condition levels. Design/methodology/approach A fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) regression model is developed which uses personal bankruptcy filings as its dependent variable during the years 2000 through 2018. This time-series model considers the association between personal bankruptcy court filings and costly, widespread flooding events. Independent variables were selected that potentially act as mitigating factors reducing bankruptcy filings. Findings The FMOLS regression results found a significant, positive association between flooding events and the total number of personal bankruptcy filings. Higher flooding costs were associated with higher bankruptcy filings. The Home Price Index is inversely related to the bankruptcy dependent variable. The R-squared results indicate that 0.65% of the movement in the dependent variable personal bankruptcy filings is explained by the severity of a flooding event and other independent variables. Research limitations/implications The severity of the flooding event is measured using dollar losses incurred by the National Flood Insurance program. A macro-case study was undertaken, but the research results would have been enhanced by examining local areas and demographic factors that may have made bankruptcy filing following a flooding event more or less likely. Practical implications The paper considers the impact of the natural disaster flooding on bankruptcy rates filings. The findings may have implications for multi-family properties as well as single-family housing. Purchasing flood insurance generally mitigates the likelihood of severe financial risk to the property owner. Social implications Natural flood insurance is underwritten by the federal government and/or by private insurers. The financial health of private property insurers that underwrite flooding and their ability to meet losses incurred needs to be carefully scrutinized by the insured. Originality/value Prior studies analyzing the linkages existing between housing prices, natural disasters and bankruptcy used descriptive data, mostly percentages, when considering this association.

But if that person moves to, say, Guam or the U.S. Virgin Islands, that person loses their right to federal aid. Similarly with SNAP (food stamps), federal spending rises with increased demand-whether because of a recession, a pandemic, or a climate disaster. But unlike the rest of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa receive a limited amount of federal food assistance, regardless of need. That's why, after Hurricane Maria, despite additional congressional action, over a million Puerto Rican residents lost food assistance. And with Medicaid, federal law caps medical assistance for each of these five territories, a limit that does not exist for the fifty states or the District of Columbia. This Article draws much-needed attention to these discrepancies in legal status and social protection. It surveys the eligibility rules and financing structure of disability benefits, food assistance, and health insurance for low-income Americans in the states and the territories. A comprehensive account of these practices provokes questions about the tiers of citizenship built by a fragmented and devolved American state. Part I invokes the scholarship on social citizenship, the idea that an individual cannot meaningfully participate in society without some modicum of economic security. Part I then explores the tension between that normative commitment and one of the defining features of the American welfare state-federalism. It then elaborates the exceptional legal status of Americans who live in U.S. territories. Part II provides a comprehensive overview of federal food, medical, and disability assistance and, in doing so, demonstrates how the American territories inhabit a different and, in many ways, dilapidated corner of the American welfare state. Part III begins with an analysis of ongoing cases in federal court that challenge this facial discrimination. It then canvasses legislation introduced in Congress that would make significant progress in putting territorial Americans on par with Americans in the fifty states. To conclude, Part IV brings the states back in, using the earlier discussion of territories as an invitation to imagine an American welfare state built on a foundation other than a racial order.",2021.0,MICH LAW REV ASSOC,Government & Law,TERRITORIAL EXCEPTIONALISM AND THE AMERICAN WELFARE STATE,Political science,Andrew,Andrew,0.0,0.0

Using floating species is less generalized than submerged species. Sediment transfer is more adequate for temporary wetlands. Hydrophyte revegetation as a restoration tool could be improved by selecting suitable wetlands, increasing focus on species biology and ecology, choosing the suitable propagation and revegetation techniques (seeding, planting).

I discussed these discourses around three themes: livelihoods dependence, financial incentives, and place attachment and social norms. Results indicate that the reasons why communities practice conservation are complex and subjective, and payment of monetary incentives or lack thereof will not necessarily motivate them to participate in the REDD+ program.

The results indicated that the dynamical downscaling tended to reduce the warm (cold) biases of the present-day daily maximum (TXx) and minimum temperatures (TNn) simulated by FGOALS-g3. Under the SSP scenarios, substantial increases in TXx and TNn and the number of warm days and warm nights throughout China were projected by both models. The average increase in TXx in most of the river basins ranged from 1 to 2 degrees C under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, from 2 to 3 degrees C under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and from 3 to 5 degrees C under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Reductions in the number of cold days and cold nights were projected across China, but these reductions were smaller than the increases in the number of warm days and warm nights. The interregional variability in the increases in TXx and TNn was more pronounced in the SSP5-8.5 scenario and the RegCM4 model than in the other SSP scenarios and the FGOALS-g3 model, respectively. Larger percentages of the land area and population of China would be affected by greater increases in extreme high temperatures and TNn. Under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP1-2.6) scenario, 20-65% (50-95%) of the impacts of extreme temperatures under the SSP5-8.5 scenario could be avoided across most regions in China.

Nonetheless, qualitative methods still play an understated role in climate and ocean change research. One important reason for this are continuing tendencies in the natural sciences to value 'hard' and value-free quantitative approaches over 'soft' and value-laden qualitative approaches. This paper argues that to overcome such methodological reservations, it is necessary to inform not only about the key characteristics of qualitative research but also - and this has received little attention - about the concrete empirical insights that can be gained from qualitative as opposed to quantitative data, despite sharing the same research focus. The environmental literature still lacks relevant examples from fieldwork that explain in detail how exactly decisive information is elicited from specific qualitative datasets, thereby illustrating how qualitative approaches matter. This paper seeks to help fill this gap by demonstrating to sceptical quantitative researchers the necessity and added value of integrating qualitative data in global environmental change research and highlighting impeding factors. This is done by presenting empirical findings about climate and ocean change adaptation in Norwegian coastal fisheries and elucidating how different qualitative interview techniques reveal that fishers who initially state that they do not worry about climate change actually do worry, and vice versa.

This review article summarizes the findings from this reassessment and various studies subsequent to it and provides an updated analysis of carcass recovery rates up to 2019. The 2013 review indicated a decreased incidence of cancer in adults, suggesting positive impacts from the regulation of toxic substances (e.g., PCBs and PAHs). However, the review also revealed that the population initiated a decline of ca. 1% per year in the early 2000s and had reached a size of ca. 900 individuals by 2012. This decline was accompanied by high inter-annual variability in calf survival and pregnancy rates and by more frequent peripartum complications among dead females. The change in population dynamics coincided with a shift in the St. Lawrence ecosystem structure and warmer environmental conditions, suggesting a link through effects on reproductive success and adult female body condition. This was supported by the continued high calf mortality after 2012 and a documented decline of fat reserves in beluga blubber from 1998 to 2016. Other factors, such as the exposure to chronic vessel noise, increasing whale-watching activities, high contaminant levels and episodic harmful algal blooms, may also be contributing to the long-term non-recovery and current decline of the population.

Yet this effectiveness stemmed from a messy political process marked by tension and competition between central, state, and local levels of government. Harnessing this tension to forge a durable, adaptable institutional framework proved to be key to the relative success of RBM in the Delaware basin, providing lessons to inform the management of shared watersheds elsewhere.",2021.0,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Toward effective river basin management (RBM): The politics of cooperation, sustainability, and collaboration in the Delaware River basin",Environmental studies & forestry,Scott,Scott,0.0,0.0

As a matter of necessity, farmers must respond to changing the climate by choosing adaptation strategies that increase their productivities. Incidentally, studies that documented the impact of climate change adaptation actions of farmers on rice productivity are few. This study therefore analyzed the impact of climate change adaptation decisions of farmers on the profitability of rice production using cross-sectional data gathered from 240 rice farmers selected from Ebonyi State, an important rice-producing State in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. Using descriptive statistics, multivariate probit regression, instrumental variable regression and endogenous treatment effect model, the study revealed that the common adaptation actions of rice farmers involved adoption of minimum tillage, bond and drainage, fertilizer, crop diversification, livelihood diversification, improved rice varieties, pesticide, nursery, and adjusting planting and harvesting dates. The study found several significant interactions between the choice of climate change adaptation actions and socio-economic, farm, institutional and location characteristics of rice farmers. The result further revealed that multiple adaptation decisions of farmers significantly increased returns to scale and profit of rice production. The study concludes that adaptation decisions are effective in increasing the profitability and returns to scale of rice production in the area and other regions with similar geographical, meteorological and socio-economic contexts.",2021.0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,Agriculture,"Does climate change adaptation lead to increased productivity of rice production?

This study uses GIS analysis and spatial statistics to explore the configuration of 1900 residential open spaces in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, a suburban county in the northeastern United States. It examines local characteristics such as open space policy, subdivision features, and socioeconomic status to identify variables that are associated with open space parcel size and connectivity and could be leveraged to foster a more beneficial configuration of metropolitan green space. The analysis finds that open space is moderately fragmented, but is abundant in the county and clustered, which could support functional connectivity.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) provides an adequate answer by aiming for higher productivity, resilience, as well as GHG emission reduction. As small-scale farms are the cornerstone of the agricultural sector, especially in developing countries, their greater involvement in climate-related actions is essential. CSA practices seek a higher and more stable income sustainably. This systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of how CSA is realized on small-scale farms, what the major CSA practices applied are, and what factors motivate and hamper higher CSA adoption. Based on 30 selected articles, the major message of the literature is a case/site-specific approach due to the tremendous heterogeneity of small-scale farms. As agricultural production is characterized by high risks and low returns, small-scale farmers must consider the length of the payback period when they decide on any CSA practices. This is the reason smallholdings, who implement any CSA practices, must achieve economic benefits, otherwise, they need to be compensated for providing environmental benefits. Moreover, simpler methods with low labor intensity are often applied. Access to the different financial instruments and inputs, knowledge/education/information, and land use security are the critical factors of the CSA adoption. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that, unlike off-farm activities/incomes, full-time farming is a serious commitment that positively influences CSA adoption.",2021.0,MDPI,Agriculture,Climate-Smart Agriculture on Small-Scale Farms: A Systematic Literature Review,Agriculture,Tamas,Tamas,0.0,0.0

The paper hypothesizes that where state policy has contributed to harvesting remaining a culturally embedded livelihood strategy, its contribution to the quality of life may influence people to remain in rural communities, despite potentially lower material living standards.

One of the action plans has been to promote afforestation and reforestation in non-forested lands for carbon sequestration. Thus, this paper aims to address the forest resources in Taiwan by using the latest national survey, reporting on an interactive analysis of forest carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, and climate-change mitigation policies. In this regard, the methodology is based on the official websites of forest resources, GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration from the yearbooks, national statistics, and regulations relevant to the mitigation policies in the forestry sector. It is found that Taiwan's forest area is estimated to be 2.197 million hectares, which corresponds to a total forest stock volume of about 502.0 million cubic meters. During the period of 1990-2018, the change in total carbon sequestration did not vary much (with the exception of 2009), decreasing from 23.4 million metric tons in 1990 to 21.4 million metric tons in 2018. Compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., 102.4 million metric tons in 1990 and 282.8 million metric tons in 2018), the contribution to GHG mitigation in the forestry sector shows a declining trend. However, biomass (i.e., wood) carbon sequestration indicates a slight increase from 20.4 million metric tons in 2010 to 20.7 million metric tons in 2018 due to the afforestation policy. Obviously, regulatory policies, based on the Forestry Act and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction & Management Act in 2015, play a vital role in mitigating GHG emissions in Taiwan.

The paper examines whether policy-makers in Israel tend to focus on mitigation strategies or on adaptation strategies in renewable energy policy discourse. The results indicate that despite Israel's minor impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, policy-makers focus more on promoting renewable energies as a climate change mitigation strategy rather than an adaptation strategy.

This model serves as an alternative to the knowledge deficit model still in use in much science communication and is applicable both for students and practitioners of technical communication. Method: The model was developed by examining Matthew Nisbet's work on framing in conjunction with Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's work on dissociation. I conducted a coded rhetorical analysis of two fact sheets produced by the Utah State University Extension Office with information on how their audience can change personal behaviors to mitigate their personal impact on climate change. I suggest how a dissociative frame would present the information more effectively. Results: A dissociative framing model can provide practitioners in technical and professional communication (TPC) a way to work around science skepticism and motivate action, especially when working with short, community-based genres, and can provide teachers of technical communication with a heuristic for instructing students on how to best engage a skeptical audience. Conclusion: While rural communities in the United States are especially prone to climate skepticism, it is important that they be informed and empowered to make the necessary behavioral changes to mitigate the human impact on climate change. Fact sheets published by extension services provide an excellent opportunity to inform and empower. A dissociative framing model provides a clear way to empower these communities with knowledge of how to mitigate their impact on climate change without diving into the political issues embroiled in climate science.",2021.0,SOC TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION,Communication,Post-Fact Fact Sheets: Dissociative Framing as a Strategy to Work Past Climate Change Denial,Interdisciplinary,Beth J.,Beth,1.0,1.0

The analysis draws on a case study conducted in the Mantaro River Valley in Central Peru using qualitative methods: open-ended interviews, participant observation, and document analysis. Findings of the study show that in the context of climate change, the production of vulnerabilities has much to do with larger socio-political structures in which protection of the highland farmers is not prioritized. The impact of the uneven scalar power dynamics in climate adaptation and other overlapping fields of policy have created uneven terms of adaptation among smallholders. This has created marginalization, conflicts, and deepened smallholders' vulnerabilities under climate change.

Whereas the Anthropocene has attracted the attention of audiences beyond specialists and has radically expanded the temporal horizon for politics, its temporal characteristics risk rendering it unhelpful for thinking critically about how the current environmental crisis can be addressed. Most importantly, by establishing a reference point in a distant future from which the present is evaluated, the Anthropocene framework gives the impression that the future is already determined and that the course of future environmental degradation is set. The Anthropocene thus fails to specify what is at stake for politics in the current crisis. As a contrast, the climate-change framework is structured as a range of scenarios. It establishes a temporal structure that opens the present to different potential futures and manifests the fact that the level of emissions in the coming decades is decisive for future climate change but not yet determined. Further, the presence of tipping points in the climate system can be understood in temporal terms as a risk in some scenarios of falling into a temporality of unfolding, a mode in which game-changing events that lead to even more emissions proceed beyond human influence. The risk of entering such a temporality that closes down the possibility to meaningfully deliberate on fundamental aspects of the future increases with the rate of emissions. The climate-change framework in this way helps us understand the environmental crisis in a new way, namely by conceptualizing the open future as a finite resource that has to be distributed globally and across generations. In sum, as a framework for engaging with environmental derangement, the climate-change framework offers a more specific and politically useful temporality than the Anthropocene.",2021.0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,Cultural Studies,On the Difference between Anthropocene and Climate Change Temporalities,Interdisciplinary,Julia,Julia,1.0,1.0

The effects of these countermeasures on the upgrade requirements and hydraulic performances of existing water distribution systems (WDSs) and sanitary sewers (SSs) are analyzed in this study. In addition to the common two-objective problems, a three-objective problem that provides cost-effective water-saving schemes (WSSs) that also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been proposed. In order to obtain and analyze solutions for all the aforementioned optimizations, the tasks of selecting WSSs considering different performances were formulated and solved as multiobjective optimization problems. The objectives considered are the minimization of the overall cost (i.e., less savings) versus minimization of water demand or maximization of network upgrade postponement introduced by WSS measures. Optimizing the GHG emissions and reductions to any of these two-objective problems completes a three-objective problem. The decision variables are the domestic water saving appliance and fitting capacities, and the tank sizes of the rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs). The method provides Pareto fronts, which are the outputs from a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The proposed method was applied to the subsystems of the Tsholofelo WDS and sanitary sewer (SS) in Gaborone, Botswana.

Technological approaches for large-scale carbon removal and storage hold great promise but are far from the gigaton-scale required. Enhanced chemical weathering of crushed silicate rocks and afforestation are proposed CO2 removal approaches mimicking events during the Devonian rise of forests that triggered massive CO2 drawdown and the great late Palaeozoic cooling.

Little research has explored how disaster managers incorporate different forms of knowledge and uncertainty into preparations for simultaneous hazards or disaster events, or how front-line disaster workers respond to and implement these plans. In this paper I draw on ethnographic research working as a wildland firefighter, interviews with firefighters and fire managers, and state and agency planning documents to examine preparations for two events occurring in Central Oregon in August 2017: (1) the height of wildfire season and (2) hundreds of thousands of anticipated visitors for a total solar eclipse. I find that different qualities of risk, hazard, and uncertainty across these two events were central to the development and implementation of disaster plans. Agency leaders devised worst-case scenario plans for the eclipse based on uncertain predictions regarding hazards from the eclipse and the occurrence of severe wildfires, aiming to eliminate the potential for unknown hazards. These plans were generally met with skepticism by front-line disaster workers. Despite the uncertainties that dominated eclipse-planning rhetoric, firefighters largely identified risks from the eclipse that were risks they dealt with in their daily work as firefighters.

Notwithstanding the increasing attention at the global and European level, precise recommendations for the governance of climate change at the geographical macro-regional level are still lacking. Macro-regions span several states with some common morphological or climatic features and adopt wider-scale strategies which are not mandatory or do not take sufficient account of the specificities of any included regions. Each region is differently administered and adopts specific climate adaptation strategies for addressing just the challenges of the territories they govern, without considering the effects on the neighbouring ones. They also decentralize the climate policies towards the lowest levels of government, and this has increased the number of local bodies involved and promoted the participation of non-governmental players and citizens. Within the macro-regions, local climate conditions and their changes can be similar; however, their impacts can vary significantly at the individual territory level, and their effects can extend beyond traditional administrative boundaries. Dealing with these changes is particularly challenging in the Alpine area, which extends across 48 regions/autonomous provinces belonging to eight different European countries and is governed by three different international/transnational strategies. This territory represents a fragile ecosystem due to the current climate changes, which have influenced the climate conditions differently at the local level, as well as the richness of natural resources, and the opportunity to exploit them for economic reasons. South Tyrol (IT) is one of the autonomous provinces located in this area that is currently addressing the expected and unexpected impacts of climate change. Unlike other Italian Alpine regions, this region boasts a wider legislative autonomy, which enables the creation of more targeted climate adaptation policies and their decentralisation to the lowest level of administration, including the non-governmental players and citizens. As a result, the climate adaptation governance framework appears complex and hard to govern due to the plurality of actors and governmental levels at Alpine and regional/provincial levels. The present article sheds light on this framework, analysing specifically the three above-mentioned governance issues: governance structures, stakeholders' involvement mechanisms, and links with the existing wider-scales strategies.

Methodologically, this paper examines the experience of the Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund and Ethiopia's Climate Resilient Green Economy Facility. Policymakers, officials related to the funds, and other stakeholders were interviewed. This paper finds that national climate funds sought to achieve mainstreaming by engaging with sectoral ministries. Such engagement was expected to lead to changes in sectoral and system-wide policy goals and instruments. The three main approaches for sectoral engagement were: serving as implementing entities, participating in fund governance, and via in-house climate change units. The findings underscore how finance received by the funds shapes programming, how the lack of detailed plans limit the ability of policies to pull in the finance desired, and the inconsistent role played by climate change units. A disaggregated approach to climate mainstreaming allows us to identify where and how financial incentives can be useful.",2022.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Development Studies,Climate mainstreaming via national climate funds: the experiences of Bangladesh and Ethiopia,Interdisciplinary,Rishikesh Ram,Rishikesh,0.0,0.0

Unilaterally declared maritime limits are generally determined by reference to coastlines and they are only binding insofar as they conform to the applicable law. Bilateral maritime boundaries are not equally affected by changing coastal geography because, once established, they are binding on parties to the arrangement under the pacta sunt servanda and res judicata principles. Maritime delimitation generally produces geographically stable boundaries. In principle, these remain fixed notwithstanding changes to the coastal geography that generates maritime entitlements or the ecosystems central to national interests. Indeed, stability and predictability are among the objectives of maritime delimitation. However, legal stability can be achieved without geographic stability and the requirement of predictability may be unattainable in a new world of environmental uncertainty. After all, baselines and derived outer limits fluctuate to reflect changing coastal geography and the same is true of bilateral boundaries, unless and until otherwise agreed. States have concluded boundary agreements that refer to fluctuating concepts, such as the equidistance line, instead of fixed co-ordinates. Furthermore, the International Court of Justice has left a segment of a maritime boundary to fluctuate until otherwise agreed and a Chamber of the Court has addressed the possibility of establishing a boundary by reference to a fluid oceano-biological boundary in the marine environment. This suggests that maritime boundaries can fluctuate if established by reference to sufficiently clear and relevant limits in the natural environment.",2021.0,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,Government & Law,Fluctuating boundaries in a changing marine environment,Political science,Priya,Priya,1.0,1.0

One of the main factors causing food insecurity is drought. Reliable, area-wide, long-term data for detecting and monitoring drought conditions are critical for timely, life-saving interventions and the long-term development of the region, yet such data are sparse or unavailable. Due to advances in satellite remote sensing, characterizing drought in data-sparse regions like Karamoja has become possible. This study characterizes agricultural drought in Karamoja to enable a comprehensive understanding of drought, concomitantly evaluating the suitability of NDVI-based drought monitoring. We found that in comparison with the existing data, NDVI data currently provide the best, consistent, and spatially explicit information for operational drought monitoring in Karamoja. Results indicate that the most extreme agricultural drought in recent years occurred in 2009 followed by 2004 and 2002 and suggest that in Karamoja, moderate to severe droughts (e.g., 2008) often have the same impact on crops and human needs (e.g., food aid) as extreme droughts (e.g., 2009). We present in a proof-of-concept frame, a method to estimate the number of people needing food assistance and the population likely to fall under the integrated food security phase classification (IPC) Phase 3 (crisis) due to drought severity. Our model indicates that 90.7% of the variation in the number of people needing aid can be explained by NDVI data and NDVI data can augment these estimates. We conclude that the biggest drivers of food insecurity are the cultivation of crops on marginal land with insignificant inputs, the lack of irrigation and previous systematic incapacitation of livestock (pastoral) alternatives through government programming.

In this article, I analyse drastic waterscape transformations and people's differentiated exposure to water-related vulnerabilities in the Grijalva River lower basin, southeastern Mexico, focusing on how state authority is reinforced through waterscape alterations and how altered waterscapes shape state-making and scalar politics. Examining interlinkages between 1) state-making and governance; 2) resource-making and politics of scale; and 3) hazard-making and the dynamics of socionature, the article contributes to scholarly and development practice discussions on environmental vulnerability. I argue that the goals of consolidating state power and promoting development through massive waterscape changes and resource extractions have provoked hazards that are difficult to control, resulting in differentiated distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. Drawing on archival research, documentary analysis, thematic interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork, the study illustrates the overlapping and cumulative effects of state-making, politics of scale, and the dynamics of socionature on socially differentiated vulnerability. Although the forms of governance shift over time, statecraft as a mode of consolidating state authority and controlling lower basin environments and residents persists. The government prevents social mobilisation through political persuasion and pressure, and disciplines residents to adapt to altered waterscapes, while allowing few changes in prevalent power structures. Simultaneously, the study demonstrates that water cannot be controlled by political rules and requisites, while local residents reinterpret dominant ways of governing through claim-making, negotiation, everyday resistance, and situational improvisation, albeit within unequal power relations. The study enhances understanding of water-related vulnerabilities resulting from recurrent, yet temporally remoulded agendas of state-making combined with socially differentiating politics of scaling and the dynamics of socionature, which altogether reformulate human-nonhuman interactions and make local smallholders and pen-urban poor increasingly vulnerable to floods.

This paper investigates what happens after calculative market devices fail, analyzing so-called ex gratia (""from grace"") practices in which insurers make payouts to aggrieved clients even when none are due under contractual terms.

Far from incidental, I argue that these practices have been constitutive of the parametric insurance market's persistence and expansion. Though ex gratia payments sometimes give rise to negotiations over indemnification with aggrieved collectivities, these unfold on insurers' terms, informalizing power and delegitimizing complaint.

Yet, studies suggest that the private partner's goal of maximizing revenue can reduce the quality of service provision and can marginalize low income populations. This paper clarifies the role of the private sector in bolstering sustainability and resilience by examining 1) the distribution of risks between public and private partners and 2) the economic, political, environmental, and social impacts of these partnership arrangements. This exploratory qualitative study utilizes interviews, observations, shadowing, and document analysis to compare 10 public-private partnerships in Southern California. This study evaluates PPP projects across the three dimensions of sustainability, paying careful attention to distributional impacts and feedbacks between environmental and human systems. The findings suggest that when carefully managed, PPPs can result in environmentally beneficial projects that diversify local water resources and improve efficiency of water utility operations. However, sustainability-oriented PPPs face a tension between profitability and public welfare due to the divergent goals of public and private partners. A complex permitting process and evolving regulations exacerbate this tradeoff through cost overruns and project delays.

Most of the nations around the globe have adopted diesel fuel-based pumping units to irrigate their farm lands. However, increased fuel cost and strict emission laws have made these nations to look for alternate and clean energy powered pumping units. Solar water pumping units are more promising alternate to address these concerns. In this review work, types and concepts of available solar thermal and electric energy-based water pumping units are discussed. Suitability of solar PV pumping units in comparison to thermal energy-based units has been listed out. Detailed procedure for sizing solar PV pumping units by considering crop water requirement, head of pump, and local climatic conditions like solar radiation intensity and rainfall have been provided based on inputs from available literatures. In addition, step by step procedure to estimate economics and environmental impacts associated with solar PV water pumping units along with results of latest studies in these areas have also been presented. Solar PV water pumping units are highly recommended for regions with at least 300 to 400 mm rainfall per year and 2 km away from local grid power supply.

Negative emissions technologies (NETs) will play an important role in limiting global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere. Available options for NETs can be integrated into energy and climate change policies. However, this strategy requires an assessment tool to select a suitable set of NETs to be integrated. A mathematical framework considering multiple environmental and economic factors under uncertainty is needed for the assessment tool. This paper has two main contributions: (1) development of a novel multi-criteria decision analysis tool based on data envelopment analysis method under neutrosophic environment, and (2) application of this tool in the evaluation of NETs considering the risks associated with the uncertainties in these technologies. The model incorporates uncertainties that result in risks when higher performance levels are assumed. A novel neutrosophic data envelopment analysis (NDEA) model is developed for evaluating NETs; this approach uses neutrosophic set theory to account for membership, nonmembership and indeterminacy in uncertain parameter values. A case study is presented to illustrated this technique. Then, a representative case study considering four alternative options for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is used to demonstrate the tool. The performance assessment of candidate NETs based on literature data is made. Results show different characteristics of NETs in terms of their sensitivity to expert's risk attitude and perception towards the different dimensions of neutrosophic decision-making environment. For instance, the preference of underground storage over ocean storage for BECCS is evident when improving the technology is assumed to be challenging. Various NETs are evaluated; technologies such as BECCS, and afforestation and reforestation show consistent ranking in different decision environments. The capability of the model to account for uncertainties can allow useful insights to be drawn by policy-makers, and thus, accelerate the deployment of NETs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, recent scholarly research articles, articles from practitioner journals, magazine articles and policy documents and reports, as well as blogs and briefings published by international organizations were critically reviewed. Findings The findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a major shake-up of global supply chain operations and has contributed to varied sustainability outcomes. While the pandemic caused reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, it has had serious social implications for the livelihoods and well-being of workers and their families. The findings further suggested that it is imperative for companies to build resilience in their global supply chain operations to better respond to future shocks and disruptions by adopting strategies such as employee protection schemes, advanced digital technologies, diversification, localization and regionalization and stakeholder collaboration.

Different rainfall conditions encountered during the experiment included wintertime stratiform frontal rainfall, intense springtime convective systems with extremely high rainfall rates (over 100 mm h(-1)), summertime convective storms, mesoscale convective systems in the rainy season (September-October), and one tropical storm (Tropical Storm Gordon). Overall, all of the rain gauges performed well, with intercorrelations of order 0.9 or better using 1-min rainfall rates and biases of less than 10%; however, each showed limitations under different rainfall situations; In particular, under extremely heavy rainfall rates (over 100 mm h-l), the disdrometer and tipping bucket rain gauges biased low, while the optical rain gauge biased high. Under light rainfall rates (under 2 mm h(-1)), the capacitance and tipping bucket rain gauges showed significant instrument noise using the 1-min sampling interval. The optical gauge was sensitive to the relative proportion of small to large raindrops within the rain. The raindrop distribution parameter N-o, the coefficient of the exponential fit to the drop size distribution, could be used to predict the optical gauge bias. When N-o is large (relatively more small drops), the optical gauge biases high, and when N-o is small (relatively more large drops), the optical gauge biases low. The acoustic rain measurement showed significant variability when compared to the other gauges. The acoustic measurement is very sensitive to the presence of very large raindrops (over 3.5 mm diameter) as these raindrops are extraordinarily loud underwater and prevent the smaller drop size populations from being heard and accurately counted when they are present. While the range of wind speeds encountered during the experiment was limited, wind did affect the performance of several of the gauges. At higher wind speeds (over 5 m s(-1)), the disdrometer and acoustic rain gauges biased low and the instrument noise of the capacitance gauge increased significantly.",1999.0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,Engineering,Relative performance of automatic rain gauges under different rainfall conditions,Engineering & technology,JA,JA,,

The growing need to consider these and other changes is accelerating efforts aimed at ensuring greater resilience, adaptability, and flexibility within the industry. To gain insight into these dynamics at the farm-level, a resilience-based assessment framework was piloted with three different types of dairy farming systems, following extensive drought on the east coast of the North Island. Using a participatory and bottom-up approach, the framework was used to qualitatively explore the potential significance of varying social, economic, and agroecological attributes between high-input, low-input, and organic systems, and their implications for resilience. The ""lock in trap"" of highly intensive systems, although profitable in the near term, may be less resilient to climate shocks because these are likely to occur in conjunction with changing market and financial risks. Low-input systems are less dependent, in particular, on fossil fuels and are associated with higher levels of farmer satisfaction and well-being. Organic farming provides ecological benefits, and the financial premium paid to farmers may act as a short-term buffer. The framework provides insight into the current context at the farm level and can draw out individual perspectives on where to target interventions and build resilience.

The evaluation was implemented through examining land elevation datasets, to a sea-level rise scenario of 1 m. The materials and methods used chart the way forward to predict the hazards by integrating available different datasets using accessible analytical tools. Concerning the inundation scenario, the submergence would take place in the east and middle of Alexandria, but natural and artificial barriers would restrain the flooding to penetrate so far. While western Alexandria is relatively preserved by coastal sand dunes and ridges, and steep land slope.

Regarding these distributional issues the academic literature offers a plethora of fairness principles, such as 'polluter pays', 'beneficiary pays', 'equal per capita rights', 'grandfathering', 'ability to pay', 'historical responsibility' and 'cost effectiveness'. Remarkably, there is a theoretical gap between these principles and the central theories of distributive justice in moral and political philosophy. As a consequence, it is unclear how these principles are related, whether they can be combined or are mutually exclusive, and what the fundamental underlying values are.

A reasonable indicator of TC damage should incorporate not only the TC characteristics (e.g., intensity, frequency and duration) but also the vulnerability of the TC-prone areas. In this paper, a new indicator is proposed to measure the TC threat, which takes into account both the TC characteristics and the vulnerability of the area. The indicator has two forms: the first one considers the maximum wind speed only and the second incorporates the integrated wind speed profile. The historical damage scenarios along the US East Coast, as well as those in Hong Kong, China, are examined to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed indicator. Results show that the proposed indicator is capable of representing the impact of TC wind field profile on the TC damage costs.

Recently, though, the policy focus throughout the region has shifted toward landscape restoration, which subsumes and expands upon the former approach to respond more explicitly to concerns about climate change. However, the limited success and challenges of translating corridors from paper into practice raise questions about the potential of landscape restoration policies to achieve intended outcomes. Centering on the experience of El Salvador, this paper draws on policy and document analysis and interviews with professionals to compare the two approaches and explore the implications of the transition toward landscape restoration based on lessons learned from past corridor implementation challenges. The paper argues that while the two approaches share many core components and objectives, landscape restoration has different spatial and distributional implications in terms of priority-setting, distribution of resources and benefits, and the promotion of conservation management strategies and alternatives.

Using the three maps of 1994, 2004, and 2015, we analyzed the land use changes during two time intervals (1993-2004 and 2004-2015) in the area for six categories, including three for forest areas (Productive, Degraded, and Treeless) and three for non-forest areas (Others, e.g., mine sites, roads, wetlands; Settlement; and Cultivated). The interval level results of the analysis showed that the land change rate was more rapid in the 2004-2015 time interval compared to 1993-2004. According to the category level results, in both time intervals, the Productive category was dormant in terms of loss and gain, whereas the Cultivated category was active.

With more than 20% of the world's plant species currently threatened with extinction, the loss of plant diversity will result in reduced options for human innovation, adaptation, and resilience. The world's botanic gardens already conserve and manage around a third of all known plant species in their living collections as well as seed banks as an insurance policy against extinction and as a resource to support scientific research. This work needs to be expanded rapidly if we are to avoid further plant species extinctions. Summary Historically, botanic garden science has been dominated by the disciplines of economic botany and taxonomy. Today, with around 20% of plant species threatened with extinction, the author argues that unless botanic gardens shift their efforts toward the conservation, management and use of plants, the loss of plant diversity will stifle human innovation, adaptation, and resilience. The enormous body of taxonomic knowledge, skills, data, and collections built up over the past two centuries is fundamental to managing plant diversity. These resources need to be used to address challenges such as food insecurity, water scarcity, renewable energy, human health, biodiversity conservation, and climate change. At a time when botanic gardens are increasingly seen as visitor attractions, rather than scientific institutions, refocusing their efforts is in the best interests of botanic gardens as well as those of broader society. The author gives examples of how botanic gardens are already supplying crop wild relatives to plant breeders; using their living collections to assess resilience to climate change and vulnerability to pests and diseases; and conserving rare and threatened plant species for future use. However, in spite of these efforts, only a small fraction of the estimated 60,000 plant scientists and specialist horticulturists in the world's botanic gardens are engaged in scientific research that has demonstrable impact on how we conserve or manage plant diversity.

The article first addresses the extent to which international law of the sea, and in particular the 1995 United Nations Fish Stock Agreement, endorses and implements an ecosystem approach to fisheries for the management of straddling and highly migratory stocks. It then addresses the barriers to more effective implementation of an integrated and adaptive ecosystem approach to fisheries in transboundary settings, including the decentralized and consensus-based nature of international law, stationary visions of ecosystems, and principles of certainty and stability. This analysis is then expanded to focus on specific challenges of adapting to climate-induced changes to transboundary stocks distribution and abundance.

Graduates mentored in breeding programs integrating these needs will be selected for industry jobs without need for re-training. Sustainable breeders will need to operate in new breeding centers located in strategic environments for faster genetic improvement ahead of climate changes. Key factors for developing useful and unique sustainable cultivars will be the adaptation of exotic germplasm and the maximization of its genetic improvement before cultivar development through public and private partnerships. Inbreeding, genetic divergence, and reciprocal recurrent selection programs will continue to be essential to purify cultivars and exploit heterosis in economically important species.",2021.0,BRAZILIAN SOC PLANT BREEDING,Agriculture,Germplasm enhancement and cultivar development: The need for sustainable breeding,Agriculture,Marcelo J.,Marcelo,0.0,0.0

This can then affect their phenotypic plasticity, which helps with the adaptation of plants to adverse conditions. Epigenetic marks may also provide a mechanistic basis for stress memory, which enables plants to respond more effectively and efficiently to recurring stress and prepare offspring for potential future stresses.

While an extensive foundation of empirical knowledge on urban climate adaptation has accumulated over the last decade, our image of institutional adaptation continues to be dominated by a focus on planning. Whilst understandable, this can obscure a fuller range of areas in which institutional adaptation to climate change is being pursued. Furthermore, methodological path dependency in large-N analysis via a common focus on analyzing formal planning documents risks a skewed perspective as such documents may only offer a partial view. Building on the rich range of work to date assessing climate adaptation in cities, and notwithstanding continued major gaps such as in small-medium cities, we now need to find ways to examine the diversity of institutional adaptation occurring in practice, and to comparatively draw on the situated interpretive knowledge of case experts within individual cities to do so. With this aim in mind, this paper explores institutional adaptation in a specific domain (urban water) in a sample of 96 major cities across six continents through a survey of 319 case experts, examining the diversity of institutional adaptation across contexts and exploratively probing its drivers. Findings show that multiple forms of institutional adaptation are being jointly pursued in cities across all continents, leaning towards 'softer' rather than 'harder' forms, but nonetheless revealing a wide range of activity. Patterns in drivers suggest a political explanation for institutional adaptation (e.g. involving change agents and political pressure) rather than a rational one (e.g. involving response to climate-related risks and/or extreme events).

An initial step in such a development towards tailored climate information would be to understand the currently available climate indices, their definitions and contexts. This study systematically reviews the scientific literature on climate indices and factors related to specific climate impacts, and in this way identifies currently available climate indices for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The identified indices are analysed relative to climate change impact categories from the vulnerability assessments and adaptation plans set out by the Swedish Forest Agency and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, to indicate development potentials and research gaps in climate indices. The review identifies 79 definitions of climate indices for forestry and 63 indices for agriculture in Sweden. The reviewed literature has employed or developed climate indices for only 11 of the 25 types of climate impact emphasised as important by the two sectoral authorities. Most of the climate indices identified have been adopted for use in modelling forest growth or crop growth and productivity. The results of the review found indices lacking for a substantial number of impacts that are relevant for Swedish forestry and agriculture. The study shows that scientific literature on climate indices to a very limited degree addresses the specific tailoring of climate indices. Potential reasons for the lack of climate indices are discussed, and the study suggests that there is a need to continue climate model development such that the models better represent relevant processes, to advance research on the co-design of indices together with sectoral stakeholders, and to enhance collaboration between adaptation, impact modelling and climatology research.

While Pakistan is frequently hit by several natural hazards (i.e., floods, droughts, earthquakes, and extreme heatwaves) resulting in devastating impacts, no national-level higher-resolution disaster resilience information is available to provide references for informed planning. Hence, this study provides a, first of its kind, multi-level comprehensive disaster resilience evaluation in Pakistan. To do so, data on a customized list of indicators within three key resilience sub-components (i.e., economic, institutional, and social) are acquired to compute a resilience index. Frequency distribution and the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) methods are employed to analyse the differences between different resilience indices and a cross-regional assessment is carried out at the sub-national level. Subsequently, an extensive spatial assessment is performed using geo-information models (i.e., Global Moran?s I, Local Indicators of Spatial Asso-ciation, and machine learning-based multivariate clustering) to explore the global and local geographies of the resilience. Based on ANOVA, significant differences between the resilience sub-components are found (95% confidence). The geographical distribution of resilience scores ascertains a large spatial heterogeneity across the study area with the least resilient regions belonging to Sindh and Balochistan provinces (95% confidence). As shown by the machine learning-based multivariate clustering, the least resilient regions particularly lack in economic and institutional aspects of disaster resilience. The findings provide important references to ensure resilience management-related cross-regional equity and justice.

Globally, photosynthetic efficiency in terrestrial plants has become increasingly challenged in recent decades due to a rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 and associated changes toward warmer and dryer environments. Well adapted for these new climatic conditions, the C-4 photosynthetic pathway utilizes carbon concentrating mechanisms to increase CO2 concentrations surrounding RuBisCO, suppressing photorespiration from the oxygenase catalyzed reaction with O-2. The energy efficiency of C-3 photosynthesis, from which the C-4 pathway evolved, is thought to rely critically on an uninterrupted supply of chloroplast CO2. Part of the homeostatic mechanism that maintains this constancy of supply involves the CO2 produced as a byproduct of photorespiration in a negative feedback loop. Analyzing the database of RuBisCO kinetic parameters, we suggest that in genera (Flaveria and Panicum) for which both C-3 and C-4 examples are available, the C-4 pathway evolved only from C-3 ancestors possessing much lower than the average carboxylase specificity relative to that of the oxygenase reaction (S-C/O=S-C/S-O), and hence, the higher CO2 levels required for development of the photorespiratory CO2 pump (C-2 photosynthesis) essential in the initial stages of C-4 evolution, while in the later stage (final optimization phase in the Flaveria model) increased CO2 turnover may have occurred, which would have been supported by the higher CO2 levels. Otherwise, C-4 RuBisCO kinetic traits remain little changed from the ancestral C-3 species. At the opposite end of the spectrum, C-3 plants (from Limonium) with higher than average S-C/O, which may be associated with the ability of increased CO2, relative to O-2, affinity to offset reduced photorespiration and chloroplast CO2 levels, can tolerate high stress environments. It is suggested that, instead of inherently constrained by its kinetic mechanism, RuBisCO possesses the extensive kinetic plasticity necessary for adaptation to changes in photorespiration that occur in the homeostatic regulation of CO2 supply under a broad range of abiotic environmental conditions.",2021.0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,Plant Sciences,"The Coevolution of RuBisCO, Photorespiration, and Carbon Concentrating Mechanisms in Higher Plants",Biology,Peter L.,Peter,0.0,0.0

While surveying the breadth of projects that involves both adaptation and insurance, I pay particular attention to a parametric coral reef insurance that was recently introduced in the Mexican state Quintana Roo. Such a project, this article argues, involves reconceptualizing the coral reef as an infrastructure that provides benefits - ultimately rents - to the local tourist industry and indirectly the state, but this coral infrastructure is itself in need of being protected through insurance as a biopolitical measure that can ensure the future life of the coral reef by rendering calculable uncertain, future climate threats to the reef. By reconceptualizing ecosystems as infrastructure that can be insured, the notion of ecosystem-based adaptation operationalizes otherwise systematic risks posed by climate change and biodiversity loss on a local scale.

Behavioral spillover occurs when the adoption of one behavior targeted by an intervention changes the likelihood that an individual will adopt one or more nontargeted behaviors. As spillover is defined as a causal process, methods that isolate cause-and-effect relationships are needed to generate evidence of spillover; however, non-experimental methods can still advance knowledge in the field. Recent work reveals growing evidence for positive spillover, including recent field studies involving commonly utilized behavioral interventions. Yet, on average, effects are small and also vary in direction and magnitude as a function of how behaviors are measured.

Contemporary political geographical scholarship has since called into question the coherency of the state as a unitary entity and as the sole legitimate arbiter of international politics. This article extends these contributions to planetary climate change adaptation. Through discourse analysis and the multi-scalar institutional and political history of climate planning, this article examines how normative discursive parameters enact prevailing political dynamics that script material futures. Drawing on recent climate planning reports of Palestine and Israel, this article investigates how state discourses operate within an asymmetric geopolitical context where issues of territoriality, sovereignty, and statecraft remain fractured and contested. Climate planning in Israel/Palestine exposes two key institutional constraints of climate governance. First, technical-managerial principles prescribe ahistorical adaptation measures that inadequately address inherently political constraints. Second, the elision of politicaleconomic and historical-cultural contingencies in favor of a universalizing geophysical representation of climate change elides the systemic production of differentiated vulnerability. Consequential of an anachronistic politics of recognition within the UNFCCC, the conditions of climate governance may ultimately embolden the asymmetric status quo.

These adaptations make sense, yet keep planning within the pragmatic scope of purposive aspirations and pragmatic problem solving. The pivotal statement of the article is that purposive systems run down in complex societies when not adequately sustained by institutionalizing sets of public norms. Public norms fulfil a different function than goal orientation. They provide a normative compass in times of uncertainty and set conditions to social interaction rather than organizing the performance of objectives or solving problems. The article aims to highlight the interrelationships of public norms and pragmatic strategies of planning. Empirically, the article addresses the major turning points of Dutch climate policy concerning the transitions of the electricity market, the major municipal-entrepreneurial initiatives of city-heating, and the decentralization of climate policies. The method of analysis is based on policy analysis of legislation, policy documents, and published contributions to public debates. The results of the analysis highlight the differences between the high policy aspirations and the outcomes. The results give evidence of the wicked problems in the complex energy transition. The discussion questions the mischievousness of 'good' planning intentions in complex social figurations, and critically examines the institutionalization of the material norms and the norms of politico-ordinance.

The study also investigates the effect of the socio-economic and institutional factors on the on-farm adaptation strategies to climate change of smallholder farmers. The study employs descriptive statistics to analyse the barriers and adaptation techniques of a sample of 125 smallholder farmers in the NDR zone of Ghana. The binary logit model was employed to analyse the effect of the socio-economic and institutional factors on the on-farm adaptation strategies to climate change. The results show that households face considerable availability and liquidity constraints in adapting to climate change. The lack of capacity building program is the major availability constraint, while the lack of funds to purchase fertiliser is the major liquidity constraint. Most farmers do not apply any adaptation technique, while the few farmers who adapt to the changing climate frequently use soil and water conservation and grow different crop varieties and diversification of the crop produced. A number of socio-economic characteristics and institutional factors (particularly governmental extension services), and the longitudinal temperature and rainfall significantly affect the on-farm adaptation strategies of households. Though smallholder farmers in the NDR zone of Ghana apply a multiplicity of on-farm and non-farm adaptation strategies, this research is limited to on-farm adaptation strategies of smallholder farmers. The study recommends that policies aimed at helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change should greatly emphasise on capacity-building programs. Also, investment in extension services to support rural farm households is highly recommended due to the great impact it has on adapting to climate change.

Macroinvertebrate communities were studied at seven upstreams prior to the floods in June 2014 and 2017 and after the floods in September 2014 and 2017 and 9 months after the second flood in June 2018. The effects of floods on macroinvertebrate communities, recovery rate of macroinvertebrate community resilience and influencing factors were investigated. Results Despite the fact that extreme floods were the only reason of the disruption, the effects of biological water quality assessment metrics after the disaster were comparable to those of heavily polluted waters. Biological indicators revealed that the communities were unaffected prior to the floods, and the water quality remained within acceptable limits. Following the disasters, the density of macroinvertebrates declined, and biological indicators demonstrated the severe depletion of water quality. Community indicators (species richness, percent model affinity (PMA), and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness) rebounded after 9 months (June 2018), demonstrating that Zarin Gol River's macroinvertebrate communities could recover even after the severe impact of the floods. As a result, macroinvertebrate samples taken from flood-affected areas revealed that extreme flooding, rather than a decrease in water quality, causes a loss of diversity and abundance.

Infiltration characteristics of rainfall were investigated for 36 rainfall events exceeding 10 mm with a total amount of rain of 969 mm out of an annual rainfall of 1192 mm. In the case of 25 low intensity rainfall events with less than 10 mm h(-1) to dry soils, the increase in the amount of water stored to a depth of 1 m was equal to the cumulative rainfall.

The concept of place attachment is used to explore people-place relationships, voluntary immobility and in-situ adaptation. Results show that place attachment is shaped by cultural, socioeconomic, ecological, and historical variables and that the relationship between place attachment and mobility is complex. The strong place attachment of the Bartangis influences immobility aspirations, short-distance displacements, and return after international out-migration.

Such analyzes addresses the following aspects: study of flood genesis and recurrence, the severity of the impact for floods of different genesis;maxima runoff analysis as the principal cause of floods; analysis of the spatial distribution of settlements vulnerable to flooding; analysis of the ice jams and ice dams as a specific natural factor causing the floods in Siberia; assessment of the degree of danger, and identification of areas with the different integral flood danger. In Siberia, more than 1400 settlements areflooded at regular intervals. Most of them are concentrated in the southern, most developed territories in the Ob, Tom and Yeniseiy basins. In Siberia, rainfall, mixed (from snow melting with rainfall) and ice-dam floods are the most dangerous. They have the highest recurrence and severity of the impact. The greatest floods risk is in the most populated and economically developed southern regions within the Ob, Lena and Yenisey rivers and Lake Baikal basins.Territories with the highest risk of floods were determined.

While this helps to maintain a neutral stance in relation to policy advocacy, this approach may also create reluctance amongst IPCC scientists to communicate affective information about climate change, which could help to facilitate behavioural and societal transitions to manage climate risks. Research from the social sciences demonstrates that communications can influence cognitive, affective, and behavioural engagement with climate change. Specifically, there is ample evidence that people's sense of 'efficacy' - beliefs about personal or collective capacity to respond, and effectiveness of responses - must be appealed to sufficiently alongside communication about the threats posed by climate change, to help facilitate mitigation and adaptation responses. This essay draws on a range of research findings to argue that the IPCC's scientists and communications personnel can nurture efficacy beliefs about climate change, without compromising on values of policy neutrality, or undermining public trust. Specifically, the essay draws on communications strategies related to vicarious learning, mastery experiences, highlighting success stories, and use of language and imagery, which have been shown to increase efficacy.

Climate change has been implicated in the dwindling productivity of the Ghanaian cocoa sub-sector, although deforestation for cocoa farmland expansion poses significant long-term risks to ecosystem stability and environmental conservation. This study assessed farmers' perception of climate change, their adaptation methods and the factors explaining involvement in the renovation/rehabilitation of old cocoa farms. The data were collected from 378 cocoa farmers in Ahafo Ano North District in the Ashanti region. The data were analysed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Ordinary Least Square regression, Negative Binomial regression and Two-stage Probit regression. The results showed that the majority of the farmers were older than 50 years and attained primary education. High temperature (64.29%), too stormy rainfall (64.29%) and too much rainfall (61.90%) were largely perceived by cocoa farmers in 2015. The farmers were adapting to climate change through diversification into other crops (70.63%), planting of hybrid varieties (71.69%), commitment to spray cocoa pods regularly (74.87%) and initiation of some changes in the planting and harvesting times (71.96%). The adaptation was significantly influenced (p < 0.05) by cocoa farming experience, number of children under the age of 5 years, perception of extremely high temperature, perception too low rainfall, perception of delay in commencement of rainfall, cultivation of cocoa as the primary crop, perception of delay in rainfall stop and delay in regular farm clearing and rented farm. Cocoa rehabilitation decision was influenced by climate change adaptation indicator, monthly income, perception of extreme temperature and sharecropping.

Innovations in this sector are being promoted as part of the adaptation solutions to this problem. In this paper, we use available data on water-related climate change adaptation technological developments to examine the degree to which the vulnerability to climate change in the water sector is motivating these innovations. Using pooled data for African countries between 1990 and 2016, we estimate the relationship between climate-induced vulnerability in the water sector and water-related innovations, controlling for country size and proxies for technology transfer environment, institutional and regulatory quality, knowledge base, and research and development activity. Data on innovative activity shows evidence of over-dispersion; thus we use the negative binomial distribution with robust standard errors for estimation of our model. We find evidence that countries most exposed to water stress are innovating at lower rates. Though counterintuitive, this result is explained by the fact that such vulnerable countries also tend to have little research and development infrastructure needed to develop the kind of high quality innovations that usually necessitate patenting. Our result suggests that African countries experiencing water stress may need to reconsider priorities in the design of water-related adaptation to climate change. We also find that a country's knowledge base and openness to trade are important determinants of adaptation technologies in the water sector. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Through constructivist institutionalism, the article foregrounds agency as an important element to understand transboundary water interactions, arguing that structure and agency are mutually constitutive. This enables a shift from methodological individualism to an appreciation that structure and agency each possess independent analytic qualities that evolve with time. In turn, this produces complex transboundary water interactions that are interconnected through a triad of structure, ideas and agency. The article draws its analysis from 43 interviews conducted with different stakeholders in the Incomati river basin, participatory observations, informal conversations, a review of literature and SADC official documents. Despite various measures in place to promote regional development and integration, power still permeates SADC water governance in a way that affects information sharing and equitable and sustainable water management.

Yet this market has proved far less successful than advocates hoped or critics feared. Rather than a speculative tool for surplus extraction from smallholders or a mechanism for their financial subjectification, this article reinterprets weather insurance as an infrastructure of concessionary transfers from the development sector to make market-mediated mechanisms work. These transfers are emblematic of the new distributional terms struck between donors, states, and insurance capital as financial risk transfer is articulated with the extension of fragmentary safety nets. Economic field experiments with insurance have proliferated as venues in which the value of insurance is tested by both economists and experimenting subjects. Just as data from these trials have suggested some positive welfare impacts, they have also indicated target clients are unwilling or unable to pay full market price, thus performing a new justification for the perpetual presence of subsidies. Such transfers present opportunities for reinsurers to command rents through their control of large pools of capital and their interpretive authority over techniques for pricing risk under uncertainty. In a changing climate, reinsurers are poised to collect larger rents from donors' and governments' premium subsidies meant to decrease insurance costs for the vulnerable. These dynamics of rent cycling underscore the urgency of building more equitable, systematic risk-sharing infrastructures to replace the current fragmentary archipelagos of weather insurance.",2022.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Geography,"Rents, Experiments, and the Perpetual Presence of Concessionary Weather Insurance",Geography,Leigh,Leigh,0.625,

However, not all adaptation measures bring about positive changes. In some cases, local-level adaptations may shift risks to other vulnerable places and communities. Both maladaptation, generally recognized to be undesirable at least in terms of the results it generates, and sustainable adaptation has been studied in diverse settings and for a range of climate-related risks. Sustainable adaptation aims at reducing poverty and enhancing social equity and environmental integrity in concert with risk reduction. However, there is limited research on how interventions by state and non-state implementing entities differ in addressing issues related to sustainable adaptation and the threat of maladaptation. In this paper, we use case study analysis to focus on three specific adaptation interventions-homestead plinth level raise, pond sand filter for safe drinking water, and surface and groundwater irrigation-in Bangladesh. Drawing on in-depth interviews with stakeholders facing recurring drought and coastal hazards, we emphasis on the implemented interventions and the roles played by a local NGO and central government. The first two interventions were implemented by a local NGO and the irrigation system by the government. Although the selected interventions led to many benefits, including reduced community vulnerability, enhanced resilience, and adaptive capacity, the stakeholders also identified sustainability challenges.

Meanwhile, communities in Batutegi are also suggesting that effects of climate change are becoming more prominent in their region. Indicators include rising air temperature and the increasing regularity of extreme weather changes. Studies show that land cover has decreased by up to 95% in the region. As these trends intensify, predictions note that the Batutegi reservoir and the productivity of the surrounding protected forests will be affected. This research examines FMU efforts to adapt to vulnerabilities from environmental and climate change. The broader objective of this research is to determine the appropriate climate change adaptation efforts, specifically regarding the management of sustainable forest protection. The method is conducted through regression analysis to identify significant variables and applies the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify priorities for planned interventions for climate change adaptation by the FMU. Based on regression results there were four significant variables, i.e. appropriate agroforestry initiatives, non-timber forest products, community institutional support, and local policy engagement. This research also considers various kinds of technologies of adaptation applied by local communities. Examining community efforts also presents possibilities for improving FMU institutional planning that is locally responsive. This is done primarily through agroforestry techniques and other community conservation practices. Based on the result of the AHP analysis, the findings highlight various programs related to agroforestry technologies as the top priority. Thereafter, priorities point to institutional development policies. Together, these priorities can form the basic considerations for developing climate change adaptation policies in Batutegi. These policies can be applied with, and by communities in managing forests through agroforestry, beginning with support for high quality seed procurement that also supports all phases of cultivation and supply chain through final product marketing. As a result, forest productivity and support for local income can form a robust approach for fulfilling community needs despite the effects of environmental and climate change in Batutegi.",2021.0,"MAKASSAR, FAK KEHUTANAN UNIV HASANUDDIN",Forestry,"Identifying Climate Change Adaptation Efforts in the Batutegi Forest Management Unit, Indonesia",Environmental studies & forestry,Christine,Christine,1.0,1.0

It compares between the forest surfaces within two capital regions from the Western Balkans (WB), namely Sarajevo and Tirana. This study follows a multi-criteria approach and integrates a variety of wildfire ignition or spreading causes relying on anthropogenic, hydro-meteorological, geophysical, and fuel properties of the study area. The indexing method utilizes specific techniques of data clustering and criteria weighting. The relative degree of implication that each criterion has with wildfire ignition and spreading behaviour is weighted via a hierarchical pairwise comparison (AHP) among criteria. The workflow is automated via graphical modeller in QGIS, making the method easily reproducible to other metropolitan areas in the developing regions. Relying on the map of wildfire spreading capacity index (WSCI), the study demonstrates a vulnerability analysis focusing on the exposed buildings. According to the results, Sarajevo has four times more exposed buildings than Tirana. However, the exposed buildings in Tirana record higher risk values than in Sarajevo. The sensitivity of the proposed indexing model is tested via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method, utilizing historical data on wildfire occurrences relying on the EFFIS database. The results of ROC analysis suggest that the relative weighted factors per each criteria are context-dependent, and must be calculated referring to local occurrences of wildfire. This study suggests that the urbanization and transportation network planning have a direct impact on the wildfire risk for the vegetated wildland urban interface (WUI).

As this is not a linear trend but rather by singularities and anomalies including a broad spectrum of climatic and weather extremes with high temporal and spatial uncertainty focused avoidance strategies are difficult to prepare. However, the effects of climate change are mostly addressed with outdated 'business as usual' approaches by governments and most stakeholders, which are unfit to tackle the complexity of current challenges. Coping action for natural hazards is mostly undertaken during and after such events compensating damage through payments and restoration. In the future, pro-active nature-based solutions are needed for risk mitigation and avoiding severe damage through enhancing all facets of biodiversity from species richness, structural roughness, to spatial heterogeneity of ecosystems. This will not avoid extreme weather events, but it will reduce the damage of increasingly appearing natural hazards. However, this strategy cannot be implemented all of a sudden. Long-term and spatial concepts are needed. For this purpose, currently missing governance structures based on geographical, geoscientific, ecological, meteorological, and societal expertise should be installed. In recent years, a good scientific and knowledge basis for the required solutions has been developed, which now must translate into action. Here, a series of suggestions is compiled for a broad spectrum of extreme events and societal fields, which is far from being complete but should stimulate critically needed creativity and commitment. Nature-based solutions will not deliver a complete protection and cannot be the only kind of action, but we can no longer rely on post-disaster compensation or on the safety illusion of mere engineering and construction works. The efficiency of biodiversity as an insurance for maintaining ecosystem services is well understood.

Analysts have overcome this challenge by partitioning large geographic areas into regions with similarities in climate impact on pavement distress initiation and propagation. Historically, large geographical areas have been empirically carved out into smaller regions with similar climates by experienced geographers and climatologists. The availability of extensive weather data, comprising hundreds of meteorological variables reported with a high spatial and temporal resolution, has made the use of empirical methodologies for establishing climate regions obsolete and untenable. This paper presents a new machine learning methodology for (1) establishing pavement-specific climate regions and (2) accurately separating predictor climate attributes into climate regions for use in the pavement management and high-level analyses. The new methodology comprises stochastic and machine learning algorithms: correlation analysis, principal factor analysis, cluster analysis, and decision tree. It entails preprocessing and transforming of raw climate data into uncorrelated scores that represent the majority of variance in original climate data, performing cluster analysis to partition large geographical areas into regions with similar climatic effects on pavement distress initiation and propagation, and development and extraction of if-then-else rules from a DT classifier capable of separating predictor climate attribute into identified climate regions. The methodology is tested using National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) weather data. The outcome is the identification and prediction of seven distinct pavement-specific climate regions with 88.1 percent accuracy. This methodology assures an evidence-based definition of climate regions based on the similarity of climatic effect on pavement distress initiation and propagation and improves historical empirical partitioning methods.

In response to the growing call for adaptive capacity development amid a worsening climate, it pays particular attention to the effects of organizational adaptive capacity. Three components of an organization's adaptive capacity are investigated: formal institutions, organizational slack and contracting out (inverse of capacity). We focus on organizations' technical efficiency as a key performance indicator. Using a sample of 108 bus transit system in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest from 2008 to 2017, the analysis applies the Battese and Coelli (1995) specification for stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) with panel data. A general model is estimated to incorporate the heterogeneity in both the level and efficiency of output. The results confirm the efficacy of organizational adaptive capacity to enhance efficiency amid extreme weather. Specifically, higher levels of organizational slack or lower levels of contracting out can boost technical efficiency under extreme weather. Formal institutions, while temporarily compromising technical efficiency, holds potential for salient efficiency gains in the long run.

Utilizing the three main streams of the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) method, the study expands on existing literature and examines twelve face to face 'information-rich' interviews from eight disaster-affected coastal villages of Bangladesh. The results show that disaster-affected coastal people lack a clear understanding of the concepts such as 'climate change', 'global warming', and 'sea-level rise' that seem purely scientific and atmospheric to them, and thereby hinder their risk perception capacity. Also, the misconception of 'disaster' as an 'act of God', 'resilience' as 'financial security only', and 'migration' as the 'last resort' restraints their capacity in selecting appropriate strategies related to disaster preparedness. Besides, the representation of coastal people by development workers as 'helpless', 'beneficiary', or 'vulnerable', contributes to constructing a generally accepted ideology that distorts the positive self-concept of coastal people. The distorted self-concept often makes the study population effortless in taking an active role in disaster preparedness. By highlighting the power of language in ideology construction, the study, finally, expects to keep a significant note on appropriate language representation in textual and verbal forms both at the policy and execution level for clear knowledge production about climate change-related issues and perfect characterization of each stakeholder's roles and actions in disaster preparedness.",2021.0,ELSEVIER,Geology,The role of popular discourse about climate change in disaster preparedness: A critical discourse analysis,Earth sciences,Farhana,Farhana,1.0,1.0

The recent decade has seen Arctic extreme events in climate and ecosystems including some events beyond previous records that imply increased future uncertaintly. While their numbers may increase, the distribution of the type, location, and timing of extreme events are less predictable. Recent processes include albedo shifts and increased sensitivity of sea ice to storms in marginal seas. Such new extremes include Greenland ice mass loss, sea ice as thin and mobile, coastal erosion, springtime snow loss, permafrost thaw, wildfires, and bottom to top ecosystem reorganizations, a consilience of impacts. One cause for such events is due to natural variability in a wavy tropospheric jet stream and polar vortex displacements, interacting with ongoing Arctic Amplification: temperature increases, sea ice loss, and permafrost thaw. This connecting hypothesis is validated by the variability of rare events matching interannual and spatial variability of weather.

Land-climate feedbacks have been identified and evaluated for a long time. However, in addition to the direct effect of climate change on forest biomes, recent sparse evidence has shown that land use changes may increase as a result of weather shocks. In Western and Central Africa, agriculture is the main source of income and employment for rural populations. Economies rely on agricultural production, which is largely rainfed, and therefore dependent predominantly upon seasonal rainfall. In this article, I explore the impact of seasonal rainfall quality on deforestation, by combining high-resolution remotely-sensed annual tree cover loss, land cover, human activity and daily rainfall data. I show that in poor regions that are mainly reliant on rainfed agriculture, a bad rainy season leads to large deforestation shocks. These shocks notably depend on the proportion of agricultural land and on the remoteness of the areas in question, as remoteness determines the ability to import food and the existence of alternative income sources. In areas with significant forest cover, a short rainfall season leads to a 15% increase in deforestation. In unconnected areas with small proportions of crop area, the increase in deforestation reaches 20%. Findings suggest that a refined understanding of the land use changes caused by rainfall shocks might be used to improve the design and effectiveness of development, adaptation and conservation policies.",2021.0,IOP Publishing Ltd,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Mitigating the impact of bad rainy seasons in poor agricultural regions to tackle deforestation,Environmental studies & forestry,Antoine,Antoine,0.0,0.0

These issues are the subject of daily debate, some of which is highly ideological. But it's not just moving traffic that burdens the quality of public space. Stationary vehicles have the same effect. Parked cars need a lot of space, and in built-up areas this costs a great deal of money. The infrastructure for parked vehicles (such as high-rise car parks) is expensive and gets in the way of building urgently needed affordable housing. In spite of this, legislators and the commissions that advise them shy away from deviating from the existing targets for the number of parking spaces per unit. Too great is the fear that reducing parking options could place an additional burden on municipalities and lead to conflict in the district and surrounding neighbourhoods. These contradictions are currently becoming more and more evident. Private transport is undergoing a process of transformation. We do not know how fast this transformation will take place or what specific form it will take. There is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding planning as a result. At the same time, one thing is clear: The requirements for internal urban densification, the improvement of public spaces and climate and resource protection can only be met by dramatically curtailing private transport and by reusing grey energy. We also need to reorganise urban water management in response to climate change. There needs to be local buffers in place for severe rain events, and we must use rainwater for irrigation purposes and for cooling evaporation. We can rise to these challenges using new operating and management models - or by reimagining the typologies of urban infrastructures. On the following pages, we introduce a number of pioneering projects and discuss their impact and their prospects. The focus is on examples from the city of Zurich, where political debate around the place of cars in the city has been ongoing for more than 20 years.

The uncertainty and magnitude of environmental change have been superimposed on longstanding issues of marginalization and multidimensional poverty among rural farmers. The combined and interactive effects of these conditions create complex trade-offs that hinder the uptake of effective climate action. In the last two decades or so, Jamaica's coffee sector has been severely affected by socioeconomic, environmental and institutional stressors resulting in rapid declines in the production and livelihood conditions of thousands of farmers across the island. To address these challenges, multilateral donors, government and non-government agencies have advanced several climate resilience programs in the last decade. Yet, there is a paucity of research on the livelihood resilience of farmers to socio-ecological change, and effective metrics to monitor and evaluate adaptation responses.

Quantitative survey data are combined with qualitative information from focus group discussions and key informant interviews to develop storylines around the domains of livelihood resilience. The results provide baseline information on the livelihood resilience of local coffee farmers and within the context of changing social, agronomic and environmental conditions.

Forests and forest management are currently the victim, not the driving force, of the ongoing climate warming process, and the adaptation of forests to climate change requires coordination of policy solutions. The member states of the European Union do not pursue a common forest policy, whereas the implementation of forestry policy solutions aimed at counteracting negative climate change should be approved and adopted on a global scale.

As its ice thaws, buried resources, trade routes, and new tourist opportunities are suddenly accessible. The borders of the earth's two largest nuclear rivals, the US and Russia are less than 3 miles apart in the Arctic region and their hostility is growing. Seeking new trade routes and investment opportunities and rapidly rising above its rank as the earth's third most powerful country, China, has declared itself a 'near Arctic state' and is exercising a voice in Arctic affairs. Russia and Arctic NATO members have expanded their military presence in the far North. Despite potential tensions and rapidly melting ice, there is no effective overarching governing regime in the region that can mitigate the climate crisis or manage conflicts were they to arise. Nonetheless, the Arctic remains free of interstate violence. The explanation for the absence of violent conflict cannot be found in traditional International Relations (IR) Theories. Looking below the radar of IR theory and expanding the Human Heritage approach, I show that the region contains a web of overlapping local, regional, national, and pan-Arctic institutions and agreements, built on both traditional and Western knowledge and often steered by indigenous knowledge holders in Arctic governance. This informal web of governing regimes manages Arctic resources to protect human heritage and guard human security. In doing so, it creates a cooperative environment which guides dispute settlement among Arctic states. It is the power of these networks, their normative commitments, and the knowledge that informs them that help to explain the absence of violent interstate conflict in the region.",2021.0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,International Relations,Explaining Arctic peace: a human heritage perspective,Political science,Beverly Kay,Beverly,1.0,1.0

One must also consider the building's ""thermal resilience,"" i.e., its ability to withstand a heating plant outage. Designing for resilience is of growing importance, especially for military and government installations that must maintain critical functions even during outages. Buildings with a fast rate of temperature degradation with the loss of heating system function have low resiliency; buildings with a slower rate of temperature degradation have higher resiliency. In extreme cold climates, resiliency can play an integral role in protecting property during an outage. A drop in indoor temperature can pose a risk of freezing plumbing, which can lead to burst pipes and interior flooding that can cause enormous and costly damage, and which can effect a loss of workspace in an office building. More resilient designs must consider not only building HVAC installations, but also building envelope and the whole energy infrastructure, including thermal capacity of concrete and brick walls, internal water pipes, critical system redundancy, outside insulation without weak points, and a centrally controlled, low carbon hot water heat supply. This paper describes a quantitative approach to evaluate a system's resiliency based on analytical and experimental studies conducted under IEA EBC Annex 73 and the Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) project Technologies Integration to Achieve Resilient, Low-Energy Military Installations, to evaluate building energy performance in extreme climate conditions. This work recommends that more thermally resilient designs for buildings in cold climates include consideration of increased thermal resistance of the building envelope, improved whole-building airtightness, and higher thermal mass.",2021.0,E D P SCIENCES,Construction & Building Technology,Parameters for Thermal Energy Systems Resilience,Engineering & technology,Alexander M.,Alexander,0.0,0.0

In this paper, we argue that the attempt to marry green and COVID recovery programs may prove an even less fitting response to the near-term crisis, while still threatening to put environmental policy on paths that prove inefficient in the long run. We argue that green stimulus/recovery, while yielding more long-term climate benefits, would likely generate a slower and smaller recovery in jobs and activity than a traditional macroeconomic stimulus. This creates a trade-off for policymakers. The global financial crisis provides our primary real-world experience of green stimulus/recovery policies. A small but growing number of ex post empirical studies suggest that these measures' near-term growth impact was less than expected or obtained at a relatively high cost.

This paper asks in what ways warming temperatures may affect the ability of REDD+ programs to sequester carbon and support rural livelihoods. An example from the forest-rich central Himalayan region of India is used for modeling the implications of crop productivity decline on land use change decisions. Local communities derive their livelihoods through multiple avenues including forestry and farming. When faced with warming-led declining crop productivity, communities may find it attractive to enroll farmland into REDD+ programs. However, a reduced biomass growth rate due to increasing temperatures and declining precipitation would also lower the benefits from REDD+ participation, thereby delaying the timing of irreversible land use decisions. Results suggest that while higher carbon prices and declining crop incomes incentivize early farmland conversion into forests, a lower biomass growth rate discourages REDD+ enrolment. If communities are allowed fuelwood harvesting from forests, it could make land enrollment into REDD+ more attractive, leading to early conversion. However, the value of fuelwood to the communities plays a crucial role in determining the timing of REDD+ participation. When fuelwood is less scarce, warming will delay enrollment into REDD+ schemes. Whereas, when fuelwood is valuable to the community, early afforestation becomes an attractive option.",2021.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Land use decisions under REDD plus incentives when warming temperatures affect crop productivity and forest biomass growth rates,Environmental studies & forestry,Ram,Ram,0.0,0.0

Policy implications Multilateral interventions targeting climate change expanded considerably during the 2010s. The MDBs, however, continue to prioritize project-based infrastructural investments financing climate mitigation and resilience actions over more substantive climate adaptation initiatives.

Beyond the increased local occurrence of extreme events high temperatures are becoming an increasingly present limiting factor in crop production. The agriculture in the West of Uzbekistan with very limited rainfalls is highly dependent on irrigation schemes using the Amu Darya water flow. With low Winter (freezing nights with minimum air temperatures of less than 0 degrees C) and high Summer temperatures (hot days and nights with temperatures above 35 degrees C during daylight, and minimum air temperatures of more than 20 degrees C during night time tropical nights) the local continental arid climate temperatures are a main limiting factor faced by the local agriculture. The arid climate, with a crop production dependant on irrigation, allows putting the focus on temperatures influence on field crops, while rainfalls have barely any influence. In temperate countries the focus has mainly been on low temperatures as a main limiting factor. Freeze is indeed influencing the sowing period and putting crops at early development stages at risk. Even though, the West of Uzbekistan is facing low temperatures over the Winter period which is also challenging the local agriculture, high temperatures are becoming an increasing threat over the Summer period. The present study is analysing day and night temperature trends over the period 1987-1990 and 2013-2017. The observed trends are further compared with data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model available on the World Bank open portal. Regression lines have been calculated illustrating the trends over the period. The inter-annual temperature variations are important with a relative standard deviation which ranges between 16 and 50%.

The paper also provides background on climate change in the Canadian and global contexts, defines relevant terminology, and presents a literature review that positions sustainability, adaptation and mitigation in relation to records management and archives. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on qualitative participatory research involving expert interviews in 24 government agencies, universities and businesses located in 10 Canadian cities. Findings The organizations in the study are committed to sustainability and have developed significant programs and activities in support of this aim. Although the records managers, archivists and technologists interviewed are involved in related activities, there is a gap between what they are doing as a matter of course and the wider sustainability efforts of their parent organizations. As resources are tight, sustainability measurement entails more work and there are no real incentives to add sustainability components to programs, the participants are focused on delivering the programs they are hired to do. As a result, there is a sense of serendipity around outcomes that do occur - ""sometimes, green is the outcome"". Research limitations/implications This paper presents the results of research conducted at 24 organizations in 10 Canadian cities, a small but meaningful sample that provides a springboard for considering climate action in records and archives. Based on the discussion, there is a need for a records and archives agenda that directly responds the United Nation's climate action targets: strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters; integrating climate change measures into policies, strategies and planning; and improving education, awareness-raising and human institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning. In support of this aim, the paper charts possible material topics from the literature and compares these with research findings. Practical implications From a top-down perspective, organizations need to expand sustainability programs to address all business areas, including records and archives.

Timely and accurate mapping of cropping patterns is urgently needed in many disciplines. However, the existing cropland-related datasets are informative at the global level, but lack regional-scale details about cropland utilizations. Thus, there is a need for better information on the area and distribution of cropping patterns at regional scales. In this study, we developed a phenology-based cropping pattern (PBCP) mapping method based on remote sensing vegetation index time series. The new method first extracted vegetation phenological metrics (start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), growing season length (GSL) and growth amplitude (GA)) from the vegetation index time series. Then, it identified crop seasons by using the minimum crop GSL, the minimum crop GA and the maximum crop GSL, which were derived from the training samples. Finally, cropping patterns were classified based on a set of decision rules. The case study in Henan province of China showed that, the results indicated that: (1) compared with cropping index derived from the supervised classification of Landsat-5 TM images, the PBCP method provided cropping index with satisfactory accuracy of 85.3%.

Being aware of the induced effects of climatic risks, farmers have adopted adaptation strategies to build resilience. Analyzes the determinants of choice of adaptation strategies using binary models can lead to an estimation bias, since the number of adopted strategies may be correlated. This paper analyzes farm households' perception of CC, the determinants of choice of the number of adopted practices, and correlation between the most used climate-smart strategies in subsistence agriculture. Zero-inflated Poisson regression and multivariate analysis are employed using data collected from 704 farm households in Northern Togo. Households' minimum consumption needs, gender, land, access to credit and extension services are the main determinants of the choice of the number of adopted strategies. The use of resistance and high yielding varieties, crops and livestock integration, soil and water conservation practice, the use of organic fertilizer, and adjustment of sowing time are the most adopted farming practices. A strong complementarity between the adopted practices for agriculture development was found. Factors that influence households' choice of adaptation strategies include gender, household location, education level, family size, and allocated labor. Institutional factors including market access, access to credit, and extension services are also key determinants in promoting the use of climate-smart practices that are environmentally friendly.",2021.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Farm Households' Adoption of Climate-smart Practices in Subsistence Agriculture: Evidence from Northern Togo,Environmental studies & forestry,Essossinam,Essossinam,,

First, it provides an empirical (i.e., hands-on experience) account of how boundary objects (i.e., tools that allow different communities of practice to collaborate without precise agreement about the goals and purpose of working together) are used to create usable information. While boundary objects are frequently called for in the literature, there still remain few empirical examples. Second, the article argues that boundary objects provide a wider range of capabilities than is typically theorized in the climate change policy literature, which tends to focus on how boundary objects can help during the actual moments of collaboration between different communities of practice. Third, the article should be of value to practitioners and decision-makers in a wide range of geographical and political contexts beyond the New Jersey shore region who want to generate and apply usable climate change information. This paper presents a case study of how boundary objects were deployed to support a collaborative knowledge production process that resulted in the creation of climate change knowledge usable to municipal governments in the New Jersey shore region. In doing so, a case is made that boundary objects are useful throughout the collaborative process in overcoming ambiguity and disagreement. This points to boundary objects possessing a wider array of capabilities than is frequently theorized in the climate policy literature. Effectively designing and using boundary objects, however, requires carefully considering how they interface and interact with one another.",2021.0,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Cooperation without Consensus: Brokering Resiliency with Boundary Objects,Environmental studies & forestry,David C.,David,0.0,0.0

The study particularly evaluates the role of perceived climate extremes (frequency of dry spells and droughts), early warning information, and access to private ranch grazing, in determining response decisions to climate change. Besides, we test if households jointly adopt climate change adaptation strategies. The primary data collected from 440 sample households was analyzed using the multivariate probit (MVP) model. In the MVP model, we consider the following measures: increased mobility (distance & frequency), storage/purchase of fodder, change in water management, partial shift to other livelihoods, and herd management. The results reveal that these adaptation strategies are jointly adopted by pastoralists as complements and substitutes. From the empirical result, the perceived increase in the number of dry spells and drought, access to early warning information, access to private ranch grazing, main market distance from homesteads, and the highest level of education in the household are the key determinants of the choices of adaptation strategies to cope with drought and climate change. From a policy perspective, this research contributes to the ongoing debate on best practices by addressing climate change-related challenges in semi-arid land management. Therefore, there is a need for early warning institutions to increase their visibility in the semi-arid areas by exploring effective methods of delivering climate risk information in good time. Improving access to market and private ranch grazing should be promoted in the Kenyan semi-arid areas. Given that pastoralists' perceptions of climate change and climate risk is a decisive variable in adaptation decision-making, there is need to improve the understanding of pastoralists' changing climatic conditions. Furthermore, since the results indicate that mobility and storage of fodder are substitutes, the adoption of hay production could become a key production strategy for pastoralists which will increase the competitiveness of their livestock in the market and increase milk production.",2021.0,SPRINGER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Drought responses and adaptation strategies to climate change by pastoralists in the semi-arid area, Laikipia County, Kenya",Environmental studies & forestry,S.

While vulnerability assessments are intended to inform decision making, they often lack process-based mechanisms that enable them to be framed in terms of localized knowledge and perspectives. This is a weakness because occupant attitudes regarding places can spark unyieldingly negative reactions to expert-generated, objectivist vulnerability assessment processes and their outputs.

Yet the global system meant to provide protection to the displaced continues to privilege the interests of nation-states rather than those of refugees and has resulted in less willingness by many countries to accept refugees for resettlement. The arrival - actual or potential - of large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers continues to spur a backlash against them, fuelled by fears of security threats, economic costs, and a lack of integration of newcomers. This situation has combined with xenophobia, racism, and broader cultural anxieties and led to a rising tide of nativist populism and even less welcome for those seeking sanctuary. Whereas by the late 1990 s the dominant logic governing refugee protections - at least in name if not in practice - was centred on multilateralism and humanitarian obligations, today there is a more explicit prominence of national interests in refugee policies. In this paper I argue that the continued dominance of nation-state centric priorities is indicative of the fragility of the global refugee regime. I use the example of Canadian and US responses to the Syrian refugee crisis and interviews with officials in each country to illustrate the primacy of national interests rather than international agreements and norms. The US chose to limit and eventually bar most Syrians from resettlement whereas Canada chose to accept a large number over a short period of time. I argue that both cases reveal similar patterns and logics, if not outcomes and an increasing alignment between border controls and immigration policy.

This narrative literature review applies the conceptual framework for resilience developed for complex systems to identify five planning and policy issues critical to disease emergence, transmission, and outbreak. First, since urban settlements and activities facilitate pathogen transmission between species, reducing 'shocks' like zoonotic diseases and climate change requires not just prioritizing urbanization patterns and land use in urban policies for environmental health, but also animal rearing practices and biodiversity maintenance. Second, since disease transmission is linked to not just contact rate but also host susceptibility, reducing vulnerability by improving equity in access to essential infrastructures like housing, water, sanitation, healthy food, green/public spaces, healthcare-that impact human health directly and indirectly-is critical. In its absence, curbing disease transmission requires focusing on contact rate suppression, but doing so brings human activity to a halt, decimating the economy and livelihoods. Third, the persistence of many pathogens or their vectors in environmental media suggests that built environment & public health professionals must address maintenance of environmental quality at various scales. Fourth, there is a need for redundancy, be it in commodity supply chains (like PPE, food) or data management for say, monitoring & enforcement of home quarantines during a pandemic. Fifth, while it is crucial to have a centralized response for healthcare, decentralized infrastructure management has been critical during this outbreak: including participatory governance structures to recruit civil society in data collection and self-reporting, reliance on and quick development of mutual aid groups to distribute food and other essential supplies, localized approaches to repurposing infrastructures to create safe public spaces.

This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches. However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century, and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked, forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary adaptation.

In Egypt, which is highly vulnerable to climate change, gender analysis of vulnerability is almost non-existent. This paper addresses this important research gap by asking and drawing on a rural Egyptian context 'How do the gendered relational aspects of men's and women's livelihoods in the household and community influence vulnerability to climate change?'. To answer this question, I draw on gender analysis of social relations, framed within an understanding of sustainable livelihoods. During 16 months of fieldwork, I used multiple ethnographic methods to collect data from two culturally and ethnically diverse low-income villages in Egypt. My main argument is that experiences of climate change are closely intertwined with gender and wider social relations in the household and community. These are shaped by local gendered ideologies and cultures that are embedded in conjugal relations, kinship and relationship to the environment, as compared across the two villages. In this paper, I strongly argue that vulnerability to climate change is highly gendered and therefore gender analysis should be at the heart of climate change discourses, policy and interventions.",2021.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Is vulnerability to climate change gendered?

Meadow vegetation was established on crushed brick based substrate either by introducing plants as seedlings and seeds or by using pre-grown readymade mats. Annual retention varied from 40% to 70%. The highest retention, ca. 80%, was found in summer even though it was the rainiest season. Wintertime retention was 30-40%. The coarse substrate enabled infiltration even when frozen and, thus, the roofs operated also in winter. Heavy storms occurred mainly in summer, the season with the highest hydrologic performance of the roofs, resulting in >80% peak attenuation and slow release of runoff. In individual rain events, runoff from meadow roofs was largely a function of rainfall depth. However, retention was weakly explained by the amount of rainfall or by other variables, such as rainfall intensity or antecedent dry period, indicating the difficulty in capturing the complex phenomena behind variable weather conditions.

The channel change paradigm spans the millennia; by the late 20th century, the extent of Anthropocene harm to rivers justified both a radical label as 'damage' and a professional focus to prescribe remedies. Imitating engineering, then dominant in river management, Gregory favoured the term 'design'. The damage principally impacted river habitat and increasing collaboration with freshwater ecologists in the restitution of damage became part of the international move to 'river science'. European legislation strengthened the legal status of physical habitat in overall river quality. In the 21st century fluvial geomorphology has both strengthened and diversified further within 'river science', but also gaining social, behavioural, even political, insights through 'citizen science' and the 'co-design' of river corridor projects with communities.

Instead I argue for less of focus on what we call people migrating in response to climate change, and more of a focus on how we talk about them.

Post-pandemic financial measures are designed to support bank lending, boost financial markets' liquidity, reduce banks' funding liquidity costs, and allow for a smoother transition in monetary and fiscal policies. However, when analyzed in a broader framework that considers possible interlinkages between the pandemic and threats posed by climate change, these measures are not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Indeed, there is no evidence that recovery policies to date reflect sustainability priorities nor do they account for climate-related financial risks. The analysis carried out suggests that this failure to account for climate change could amplify the build-up of additional climate-related financial risks and of existing vulnerabilities in the financial system, leading to increased overall exposure to climate risks and thus undermining the low-carbon transition in G20 countries. Against this backdrop, the paper reviews several financial measures to avoid increasing the high carbon bias of existing policies and to explicitly address climate-related risks in the financial sector. The author proposes an enhanced macro-prudential policy framework to achieve three interrelated objectives: tackle climate-related financial risks, scale up green finance for a greener and more sustainable recovery, and preserve the global financial system's resilience. Key policy insights A macro-prudential strategy aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement is needed to address carbon bias, avoid the increase of climate-related financial risks, and reorient financial flows towards sustainable investments. 'Green-enhanced' capital requirements can be used, but they need careful calibration to prevent financial instabilities, while green liquidity instruments pose fewer implementation concerns. Climate-related large exposure limits could help contain systemic risks deriving from the materialization of climate risks. Harmonized taxonomy and enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements are critical for the correct functioning of proposed climate-related financial instruments. Implementing such instruments in a post-pandemic financial policy framework could help underpin a transformative financial response to climate change while strengthening the resilience of the global financial system.",2021.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Towards a post-pandemic policy framework to manage climate-related financial risks and resilience,Environmental studies & forestry,Paola,Paola,1.0,1.0

The species is also one of the most essential trees in home gardens in South Asia due to its wood quality and medicinal value in folk remedies. It is a deciduous tree species, and the amount of litter that falls from teak trees is huge. The decomposition rate of the litter is relatively fast in tropical humid conditions. The interactions between teak and weeds, or crops, under the teak trees have been evaluated in terms of allelopathy. Evidence of allelopathy is documented in the literature over the decades. The leachate and extracts of teak leaves suppress the germination and growth of several other plant species. Phytotoxic substances, such as phenolics, benzofurans, quinones, terpens, apocarotenoids and phenylpropanoids, in the teak leaves, were isolated and identified. Some phytotoxic substances may be released into the soil under teak trees from leaf leachate and the decomposition of the litters, which accumulate by annual leaf fall and can affect the germination and growth of undergrowth plant species as allelopathic substances. The allelopathy of teak is potentially useful for weed management options in agroforestry and other agriculture systems to reduce commercial herbicide dependency.

The supplied petroleum hydrocarbon life-cycle for refined products is a framework that enables structured engagement between supplier and customer on a range of sustainable development issues because it is an example of an input into the mining industry that affects the entire mining and minerals processing value chain. To support a transition to alternative energy sources on mine, mining and minerals processing companies are seizing the opportunity that petroleum hydrocarbon suppliers offer to their own businesses by engaging with them proactively. This study reports a case study of a mining company in eastern Australia that engaged with its petroleum hydrocarbon supplier using an engagement process based on human-centred design. The results illustrated the use of a human-centred design approach to supply chain engagement which re-oriented the supplier to take increased responsibility for fuel and lubricants impacts at the mine, and find alternative energy solutions. This study is an example of how industry self-regulation can be harnessed to drive incremental change at an operational level in the mining sector. In conclusion, the mining operation harnessed an existing supplier relationship to raise challenges posed by sourcing hydrocarbons, and to secure commitments from the supplier to improve their environmental performance in relation to supplied fuels and lubricants. Recommendations arising are for mining companies to capitalise on existing relationships with hydrocarbon suppliers to drive greater shared ownership of liabilities, as well as leveraging supplier capability to secure sustainable energy sources for mining operations.

The Springs have a high water clarity of 63 m, due to the action of biofilms and stygofauna in the aquifers; to protect this water clarity it is recommended that the level of NO3-N in the Springs should not exceed 0.4 mg/L. In the aquifers' unconfined zone there are 45 km(2) of lowland, free-draining gravels that receive over 2000 mm/a rainfall. The intensification of dairy farming on these soils has resulted in the Springs NO3-N rising to above this trigger concentration of 0.4 mg/L. Three processes, in order of effectiveness, are being considered to control farm impacts on water quality: 1. Dairy farmers have volunteered to stop cattle having direct access to waterways, to manage their dairy-shed waste better and to plant narrow riparian strips. There is some evidence this has reduced farming impacts to waterways. 2. The second method, promoted by the local regional council, is to have stakeholders, assisted by professionals, to recommend water allocation and water quality guidelines for inclusion in their regional plan.

In this study, we conducted a critical review of the compound environmental impact of urban mitigation strategies, and evaluated, besides the targeted cooling effect, the resultant co-benefits, trade-offs, or unintended consequence, in terms of building energy saving, air quality improvement, carbon emission offset, and impact to human health. Furthermore, we proposed a novel mathematical framework that is capable of assessing the compound environmental impact in a unified way, together with some preliminary results as the proof-of-concept. A number of knowledge gaps are identified which calls for future transdisciplinary synergy among urban engineers, atmosphere and climate scientists, and epidemiologists.",2021.0,ELSEVIER,Construction & Building Technology,"Compound environmental impact of urban mitigation strategies: Co-benefits, trade-offs, and unintended consequence",Engineering & technology,Zhi-Hua,Zhi,0.16666666666666666,0.0

Five major problems have been revealed, which result from using water bodies and water resources: depletion of water resources, leading to a quantitative water shortage; contamination of water bodies, leading to their qualitative degradation; changes in the water regime and water balance of terrestrial landscapes and water bodies due to anthropogenic activities that lead to disruption of the circulation of moisture, climate change, and changes in aquatic biogeocenoses; problems that arise from cross-sectoral trade-offs, as well as from uneven spatial distribution of water resources, different rates and stages of economic growth and levels of socio-economic development; and hazardous natural phenomena and disasters.

After controlling for carbon price, market volatility, and policy uncertainty, we find that oil price has a stronger asymmetric persistence on the cycle of clean energy assets pre-Paris Agreement. In the period post Paris Agreement, however, the roles are reversed. Technology stock prices are the best regime drivers for clean energy assets with strong nonlinear asymmetric persistence, and the impact of oil price is completely absent.

Challenges with the invisibility of ""carbon"" as a resource-both literally and figuratively-was a common theme as community members questioned the feasibility of carbon as a commodity and expressed concerns that if REDD+ did succeed, their land rights might be usurped by more powerful interests.

Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of farmer adaptation strategies with their costs and benefits of each adaptation strategy. The data were collected from 155 farm households using a random sampling method through semistructured questionnaires. The result of the multivariate probit model revealed that the likelihood of farmers to adopt adjustment of planting date, changing crop varieties, intercropping, crop rotation, irrigation, and minimum tillage were 51.6%, 61.9%, 56.1%, 38.1%, 10.3%, and 27.1%, respectively. The joint likelihood of using all adaptation strategies was 4.2%, while their failure to adopt all the adaptation strategies was 9.8%. Among the given adaptation options, intercropping, adjusting planting dates, crop rotation, and changing crop varieties are economically viable climate adaptation strategies. Regarding the intensity of adaptation, 78% of sampled respondents were used more than one adaptation option, and their NPV and BCR were higher when they used at least one adaptation option. Farmers who did not adopt any adaptation options were able to receive the lowest income per unit production. The study recommends that households should use multiple combinations of adaptation practices rather than the use of a single adaptation option. Thus, the government and stakeholders must provide educational and extension service, training, and updated climate information to smallholder crop producers to use and select the best and combination of adaptation strategies.",2021.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,Business & Economics,"The cost and benefit analysis of climate change adaptation strategies among smallholder crop producers in the case of Sekela district, West Gojjam zone, Ethiopia",Economics,Yaregal,Yaregal,,

Study of these patterns has given rise to a number of hypothesized ecological and evolutionary processes purported to shape biogeographic outcomes, including the climate variability hypothesis, oscillation hypothesis, ecological opportunity, competitive release and taxon cycles. Here, I introduce the alternative range shift-niche breadth hypothesis, which posits that broader niches and larger range sizes are jointly determined under eco-evolutionary processes unique to expanding ranges, which may or may not be adaptive, but which co-shape observed latitudinal gradients in niche breadth and range size during periods of widespread range expansion. I formulate this hypothesis in comparison against previous hypotheses, exploring how each relies on equilibrium versus non-equilibrium evolutionary processes, faces differing issues of definition and scale, and results in alternative predictions for comparative risk and resilience of global ecosystems. Such differences highlight that accurate understanding of process is critical when applying macroecological insight to biodiversity forecasting. Furthermore, past conceptual emphasis on a central role of local adaptation under equilibrium conditions may have obscured a ubiquitous role of non-equilibrium evolutionary processes for generating many important, regional and global macroecological patterns.

Several factors have contributed to the current water resources bankruptcy, ranging from anthropogenic impacts, such as an inefficient agricultural sector and aggressive withdrawal of groundwater, to climatological impacts. This paper suggests that water resources mismanagement in Iran should be evaluated beyond the policy-makers decisions, as it recognizes that the bankruptcy has been intensified due to the structural and institutional form of the political system in Iran. This study discusses the roots of the water bankruptcy and identifies four major shortcomings caused by the political system: (1) the absence of public engagement due to the lack of a democratic and decentralized structure; (2) adopting ideological policies in domestic and foreign affairs; (3) conflicts of interest and the multiplicity of governmental policy-makers and sectors; and (4) a state-controlled, resource-dependent economy. Through the development of a generic causal model, this study recommends a systematic transition towards a democratic, decentralized, non-ideological, and economically diverse political governance as the necessary-but not necessarily sufficient-adaptive and sustainable solution for mitigating the impacts of water resources bankruptcy in Iran.

Though public health institutions have delineated guidelines to enhance health care systems' preparedness for climate change, embedding a human rights perspective in their translation into laws and policies further adds important value. Crucially, a rights-based approach strengthens health responses to climate change by calling attention to how climate law and policy fail to account for persistent and interlocking socioeconomic inequalities. This is an area that has not been fully present in the provision of health services in Latin America, which rely almost exclusively on a conventional epidemiological perspective and do not consider the historical and sociocultural nature of health challenges. Hence, this paper draws on two case studies-Brazil and Colombia-to identify the extent to which their national climate change laws and adaptation plans incorporate a human rights-based approach in their tasks to enhance their adaptive capacity through the expansion of affordable and quality health care. With respect to the countries' laws, the absence of explicit references to the right to health exemplifies the fragmentation between the international human rights framework and international climate change law.

The notion of urban (climate) resilience has become highly popular in both research and practice. However, the concept is inherently malleable; it can be framed in different ways, emphasising different problems, causes, moral judgements, and solutions. This review explores contrasting ways of framing urban climate resilience and their potential consequences. It identifies four typical framings: Urban Shock-Proofing (short-term & system focus), Resilience Planning (long-term & system focus), Community Disaster Resilience (short-term & community focus), and Resilient Community Development (long-term & community focus). These framings lead to different approaches to urban resilience and climate adaptation in research, science-policy-society interactions, governance, and practical resilience-building. They also offer different synergies with wider sustainability efforts, including the SDGs. Resilience Planning is widely represented in urban climate adaptation research. However, Resilient Community Development, dealing with community self-determination, equity, and deeper long-term socio-political determinants of vulnerability, is currently underdeveloped. Expansion of current scientific and institutional toolboxes is needed to support and build community-based adaptive and transformative capacities.

I reveal that protected area management is particularly challenged by human land use, climate change, invasive species, and social, political and economic limitations. Protected area management often lacks the continuous availability of data on current states and trends of nature and threats. Biocultural conservation, climate-smart management and biosecurity approaches help to overcome challenges induced by human needs, climate change and invasive species, respectively. Economic valuation and shifts in funding priorities can boost protected area effectiveness and efficiency. In-situ monitoring techniques, remote sensing and open data infrastructures can fill data and information gaps for protected area planning and management. Moreover, adaptive management is an auspicious concept in the framework of systematic conservation planning to ensure the enduring effectiveness of protected areas despite unpredictable future developments.

Transgenics from a number of forest tree species carrying a variety of recombinant genes that code for herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, lignin modification, increased woody biomass, and flowering control have been produced by Agrobacterium-mediated and biolistic methods, and some of them are undergoing confined field trials. Although relatively stable transgenic clones have been produced by genetic transformation in trees using organogenesis or somatic embryogenesis, there were also unintended unstable genetic events.

This influencing role could potentially be more significant while the COVID-19 pandemic severely affects humanity, challenges the economy and increases the risk of global food shortage. However, its large national population of dairy livestock contrasts with Pakistan's top-five ranking, indeed, four to five Pakistani cows produce milk equivalent to one dairy cow of countries with a well-developed dairy industry. Low milk yield per cow negatively impacts the national production and compromises the development of an efficient processing sector, such that consumers are very often forced to use adulterated milk sold by local 'milkmen.' As a consequence, while committed to alleviating global hunger, Pakistan imports in excess of half a million tons of milk and milk-based products annually. Many studies have identified unproductive, inefficient and imprecise management issues combined with poor genetics and imbalanced nutrition as the leading barriers to improvement in the Pakistani dairy livestock sector. At an individual level, lack of awareness, affordability issues, illiteracy and low ambition of a large percentile of dairy farmers creates additional significant barriers. To address low productivity and poor genetics, Pakistani corporate farms and wealthier individual farmers import genetically improved breeds to attain high milk yields. However, they are then faced with the challenge of managing such breeds to attain sustainable and persistent milk yields under Pakistani climatic conditions, often risking excessive culling even to the point of business liquidation.

Owing to the increasing importance of technology development and transfer, a technology subregime became part of the Paris Agreement in the form of Article 10, which obligates parties to strengthen their cooperative action on technology development and transfer. This technology subregime includes the Technology Mechanism as a working mechanism, established in 2010 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The effective implementation of the technology subregime hinges upon the supporting role of the Technology Mechanism, particularly its implementing organization, the Climate Technology Centre & Network (CTCN). Technology subregimes are regarded not only as effective means to tackle environmental problems, but also as an inducement to extend the participation of developing countries in international environmental agreements. However, the means to assess them have not been widely explored. A recent UNFCCC discussion considered whether the CTCN impacted the enhancement of environmental quality in terms of mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Therefore, this study evaluates the institutional effectiveness of the technology subregime of the Paris Agreement with the CTCN.

A sustainable streetscape ensures that the spaces are long-lasting and functional as a part of the greater sustainable eco-system. Over the past two centuries, mankind has increased the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere from 280 to more than 380 parts per million by volume, and it is still increasing every day. If Earth continues to emit carbon without control, the surface temperature is expected to rise by 3.4 degrees C by the end of this century. Climate change of that magnitude would likely have serious, long-lasting, and, in many cases, devastating consequences for the planet Earth. Egypt has become one of the biggest emitters of atmospheric pollutants from the transportation sector. The level of carbon emissions and its effect on air quality are placed high on the research agenda. The transportation sector has a great impact on increasing CO2 emissions. The transportation and traffic sectors produce a quarter of the global CO2 emissions due to the heavy use of fossil fuels. This research aims to study the effects of street shape and design on CO2 production. This paper presents an analysis of road transportation in Egypt, taking Helmiet EL-Zaitoun as the main case study, with a focus on energy demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Carbon emissions are measured using ""Testo 315-3"" as a measuring instrument to identify the relationship between street design and quality on the amount of carbon emissions produced. The results of this research suggest that street quality affects the amount of CO2 emissions produced. A car moving at a constant speed will produce fewer CO2 emissions than a car forced to start-stop every while because of external factors such as cracks in the roads occurring from bad streetscape elements.

Design/methodology/approach This review article first provides a short introduction to the quasi-experimental approach using the potential outcomes framework and then uses studies on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production to illustrate how quasi-experimental methods have been applied. Papers reviewed consist of studies that estimate the environmental externalities from agricultural production, evaluate agri-environmental and other related policies and programs, and demonstrate issues related to on-farm resource use and climate adaptation. Findings Difference-in-differences (DID) and two-way fixed effects methods that utilize the spatial and temporal variation in panel data are widely used to estimate the causal impact of changes in agricultural production and policy on the environment. Utilizing the discontinuities and limits created by agricultural policies and regulations, local treatment effects on land and other input use are estimated using regression discontinuity (RD) or instrumental variable (IV) methods with cross-sectional data. Originality/value Challenges faced by the food systems have made agricultural sustainability more critical than ever.

This review summarizes recent literature regarding the impacts of climate change and related environmental disasters on pregnancy health and provides recommendations to inform future adaptation and mitigation efforts. Recent Findings Accumulating evidence suggests that the changing climate affects pregnancy health directly via discrete environmental disasters (i.e., wildfire, extreme heat, hurricane, flood, and drought), and indirectly through changes in the natural and social environment. Although studies vary greatly in design, analytic methods, and assessment strategies, they generally converge to suggest that climate-related disasters are associated with increased risk of gestational complication, pregnancy loss, restricted fetal growth, low birthweight, preterm birth, and selected delivery/newborn complications. Window(s) of exposure with the highest sensitivity are not clear, but both acute and chronic exposures appear important. Furthermore, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations may be more vulnerable. Policy, clinical, and research strategies for adaptation and mitigation should be continued, strengthened, and expanded with cross-disciplinary efforts. Top priorities should include (a) reinforcing and expanding policies to further reduce emission, (b) increasing awareness and education resources for healthcare providers and the public, (c) facilitating access to quality population-based data in low-resource areas, and (d) research efforts to better understand mechanisms of effects, identify susceptible populations and windows of exposure, explore interactive impacts of multiple exposures, and develop novel methods to better quantify pregnancy health impacts.",2022.0,SPRINGERNATURE,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",The Changing Climate and Pregnancy Health,Medicine,Sandie,Sandie,0.75,1.0

Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a primary source of food worldwide, is highly sensitive to water deficit and the development of drought-tolerant rice varieties represents a key strategy for breeding programs. Transcriptomics can significantly support the identification of genes and regulatory networks regulating plant responses to environmental fluctuations. Comparative transcriptomic studies, that analysed rice genotypes with contrasting responses to water stress, allow the exploitation of the natural genetic variation present in rice genotypes and represent a powerful tool for discovering genes involved in drought tolerance. Differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive genotypes represent ideal candidates for further characterization and allele mining in the attempt to identify useful alleles to accelerate breeding programs.

Results find that German state strategies are often non-committal sets of recommendations and identify three clusters displaying different degrees of institutionalization and guidance.

This approach allows calculating the river flow using ESM-based data over the observation period under two scenarios, considering: (1) the anthropogenic impact of increasing greenhouse gas emissions and (2) only internal fluctuations of the climate system and natural external forcing. According to the results of the numerical experiments, the attributions of anthropogenic components of climate change in the dynamics of the Lena runoff are weak, i.e., during the observation period, the Lena River flow statistically significantly increases, but it occurs mainly due to natural climate variability. The changes in the Selenga runoff are intensely influenced by the anthropogenic component of climate change.

Design/methodology/approach The data were collected through focus group discussions with 72 small-scale farmers from a rural community in Limpopo Province, South Africa. The discussions were analysed through verbatim transcripts and content analysis. Findings The study results show the farmers' understanding of climate change variability and its hazards in the form of rainfall scarcity and excessively increased temperature, which are responsible for a declining production of indigenous crops. It has also been found that in the face of these hazards, the farmers experience low crop yields, which cannot provide the household food requirements. However, the small-scale farmers use a combination of local and innovative knowledge and skills to improve their crop production. They have adopted the indigenous adaptation mechanisms, which include rainfall prediction, preparation of the gardens, change of crops and the planting season to ensure better crop yields. The farmers also adopted innovative adaptation practices such as the use of fertilisers, growing of exotic crops and use of extension officers' guidance and skills to minimise the risks and maximise the chances of resilient crop production.

More specifically, R. ferrugineus represents a very widespread threat to palms, with conflict areas in most of the coasts and islands included in the C. humilis distribution. On the contrary, P. archon represents a threat only in the northeastern part of the palm range, and large potential refuges occur in southwestern Iberia, North Africa, and several islands.

Corporate group structures serve to insulate parent companies against liability for actions of their subsidiaries. This is the case even where economic benefits accrue to parent companies, which are often incorporated in the Global North. These group structures cabin liability for environmental and climate harms within subsidiary companies through reliance on company law principles such as limited liability and separate legal personality. These company law principles allow parent companies to enjoy corporate profits from the activities of their subsidiaries but disavow liability for any environmental damage resulting from such activities. This dichotomy has obvious equity implications, which are exacerbated in the extractive industries and in the context of climate change. Negative climate impacts are and will be felt predominantly in the Global South. In addition, environmental damage removes avenues of climate adaptation for vulnerable populations. But company law principles are not impervious to these equity challenges. These principles have never been absolute and courts have consistently found exceptions to them, although those exceptions have fluctuated in effectiveness and frequency over the years. Recent decisions by the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in the United Kingdom imposed duties on parent companies for environmental damage caused by their subsidiaries.

These communities are vulnerable to climate-induced disasters largely because of historical, social and economic inequities. While this is generally true for vulnerable communities throughout the world, the scope of this Comment is limited to vulnerable communities within the United States. Any measure designed to help vulnerable communities in the United States must account for these inequities in order to be effective. Under Executive Order 13563, cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is mandated for use in all agency decisions. Yet, under CBA historical inequities that have contributed to present vulnerabilities are not taken into consideration, rendering CBA methods particularly ineffective in addressing harms wrought from climate change. Therefore, as a general rule, administrative agencies should not use CBA when making decisions to help vulnerable communities. As a general rule, agencies should focus on preserving life and liberty above preserving property. At the same time, a system that rigidly values life and liberty above property in every instance would fail to account for certain cultural and community held beliefs, as well as other historical factors that have contributed to inequity. Thus, agencies should value life above liberty in decisionmaking, except where there has been historic discrimination and non-economic value attached to land-such as community bonds inherent in the property/location or cultural or religious ties to the land.

The nation-state enjoys a monopoly on violence in domestic jurisgenesis, but international law's constraint on the use of force provides non-state actors the opportunity to participate in the formation of international legal doctrine without the threat of violence. Scholars have overlooked this non-state jurisgenerative potential, bound by a state-centric conception of law. This Article applies the claim that non-state actors have the power to influence international law to the transnational issue of climate-induced migration. Climate change intensifies slow- and sudden-onset events, and sudden-onset disasters already displace millions annually. Yet international law grants nation-states the right to largely exclude foreigners such that climate migrants have no right to enter another country, resettle, or be protected against forcible return when they are displaced across borders. While liberal scholars defend this right to exclude as necessary for the preservation of sovereignty, the majority of nation-states participate in free movement agreements - regional trade agreements that promote migration-demonstrating that sovereignty and exclusion are not mutually constitutive. Ultimately, I leverage the challenge of climate-induced migration to ask who has the power to change international law. My response proceeds in two parts. First, the Article challenges the state-centric focus of international law to call attention to non-state actors' ability to create legal norms. Second, I draw on diasporic theory to argue that the Global South diaspora-Global Southerners living in the Global North-should leverage their hybrid positionality to create legal norms that reconstitute sovereignty through admission. International migration theorists reproduce the paradigmatic image of a Global North and Global South border contest, and foreclose the possibility of migrant's jurisgenerative capacity.

The increasingly intensive use of our habitats and the consumption of natural resources are further social tasks for the future preservation of our planet. The decarbonisation of the construction industry is a key factor. But even with sound concepts, architects and specialist planners can make important contributions to a sustainable construction sector. The reduction of energy-intensive building materials, the simplification of buildings in the direction of low-tech architecture and the appreciation of existing buildings as material banks are essential basic principles of a new and absolutely necessary planning culture. The transfer from the linear to the circular economy will also have to prevail in the construction industry, the pure downcycle of materials will not be sufficient to eliminate resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Architects, structural engineers, and specialists can set decisive impulses in a pioneering role with creativity and attitude and convince builders in their courage and willingness to implement sustainable planning through their profession.

It is undoubtedly due to many adverse impacts of dam impoundment. However, stored water into the reservoirs gradually forms a significant wetland to enrich the biodiversity and support the essential ES. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of ES provided by the reservoir-based Gazaldoba Barrage Wetland (GBW) in the Himalayan foothills on the river Tista in India. The study integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to prepare an assessment framework to evaluate the ES of GBW, principally based on four indicators, sub-divided into 11 broad categories and further sub-divided into 11 sub-categories of benefits and challenges. The ES were assessed in two perspectives: first, the study identified, measured and described the ES; second, it recognized the immediate challenges to sustain the ES along with the potential challenges created by the operation of the barrage itself. The assessment identified the significant role of GBW in extending ES to the riparian communities. GBW plays a vital role in controlling 5% of peak flood flow and can cover a 0.92 million ha target area for irrigation. The reservoir water supports 80 bird species and 81 plant species and attracts many tourists, generating >1000 employments and approximately $ 1.2 million as annual revenue. In contrast, ES are sensitive to >84% of water level variations. Recent sedimentation (similar to 19 million metric tons in reservoir and canal) reduced the reservoir capacity and diversion capacity by 7%. The high diurnal flow (3-4 h) varies >70 times of the low diurnal flow due to upstream regulations, affecting the ES of GBW. Moreover, spatial variations in access to ES of GBW influence the development of differential perceptions among riparian communities, while GBW is vulnerable to increasing water demand and the geopolitics of future water sharing. Such systematic assessments based on a framework are significant for future policies and management of the river ecosystem to ensure the benefits of services for the riparian communities across the basin.",2021.0,ELSEVIER,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,A framework to assess the benefits and challenges of ecosystem services of a reservoir-based wetland in the Himalayan foothills,Environmental studies & forestry,Kausik,Kausik,0.0,0.0

At the same time, they are confronted by the necessity to increase food availability for a growing population, but also to ensure a sustainable use of natural resources. In this process, agriculture is not just the fiend responsible for an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, nor the victim of rising temperatures and extreme weather events. Agriculture is also an ally in climate change mitigation and adaptation because the selection of ad hoc crop varieties and livestock can lower the environmental impact of farming and the implementation of better management practices can promote soil conservation. Whether agriculture will have a positive or a negative impact on climate change adaptation and mitigation will depend on the rural policies implemented, but it will also be contingent on an adequate understanding of the interconnections existing between weather, climate, and farming. This review explores such interconnections by focusing on the history of agricultural meteorology, which is the research field that studies the impact of weather and climate on crops, livestock, farming operations, and plant and animal pests and diseases.

In-depth, semi-structured interview was the major approach and most interviews were conducted between June and August 2020. Here, 20 stakeholders were involved in this kind of participatory process. To make results more rigorous, the data from interviews were enriched with data from documentary reviews. Generally, the data were analyzed through theme content analysis. Findings The results exhibit that there has been little engagement of stakeholders in undertaking various researches especially in marginalized areas. In some instances, several stakeholders have been included; however, the most important ones have been excluded in the process, thus affecting the provision of data. The inconsistences affect the whole adaptation process and bring numerous controversies with the existing realities which recognize stakeholders as important entity in the adaptation process. Subsequently, this has widely affected even the set ups of decision-making organs and the policy formulation processes at large.

M.","Can Tho Univ, Can Tho, Vietnam.",1.0,"Purpose Across societies, gendered climate response decisions remain top-down and have limited progress because the influenced risk dynamics and their interrelations are not adequately understood. This study aims to address this gap by proposing an interdisciplinary innovative method, called women climate vulnerability (WCV) index, for measuring and comparing a diverse range of risks that threaten to undermine the adaptive capacity and resilience of rural women. Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on the literature to identify 12 risk categories across physical, economic and political sectors that affect rural women. These categories and attendant 51 risk indicators form the WCV index. A case study in Ben Tre Province (Vietnam) was used to demonstrate the application of the WCV methodology to rural contexts. The authors combined empirical, survey and secondary data from different sources to form data on the indicators. Structured expert judgment was used to address data gaps. Empirical and expert data were combined using a few weighting steps and a comprehensive coding system was developed to ensure objective evaluation. Findings The WCV assessment results reveal a reasonably worrisome picture of women's vulnerability in Ben Tre as top highest-likelihood and deepest-impact risks predominate in physical and economic risk sectors. Stability, human security and governance categories have lowest scores, demonstrating a fairly politically favourable condition in the province. The medium risk scores captured in land and infrastructure categories reveal promising determinants of the adaptation of women in this rural province. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the WCV index in collecting bottom-up data, evaluating a wide variety of risks that rural women face and pinpointing priority areas that need to be addressed. Originality/value The WCV is systematic, customisable and localised. It combines field research and empirical data through structured expert judgment, thus enables researchers to fill data gaps and to do evidence-based assessment about diverse risk vulnerabilities. By doing so, the WCV index gives critical insights into the challenges that rural women face. This enables local governments to better understand cross-sectoral risks, pinpoint priority areas of action and timely channel funding and policy resources to support women where they need it most.",2022.0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,A method for measuring women climate vulnerability: a case study in Vietnam's Mekong Delta,Environmental studies & forestry,N.

A more spatialized understanding of disaster justice should move beyond these dual limitations-constraints in defining disasters as isolated episodes and in planning for recovery as only emergency responses-and pay attention to the socio-spatial production of risk. This approach would better attend to underlying societal vulnerabilities created through urbanization, in this case, of the indigenous peoples of Taiwan.

Natural carbon removal methods are complex socio-natural-technical messy systems that interact in complex ways with their environments. But to work well in practice as an option in climate policy-including in any emissions trading or offsetting schemes-they simultaneously need to be framed in much narrower terms, to be accountable (modellable, tradeable).

It is in these senses that all carbon removal is technological. The ambiguity between an often vague framing as natural, a narrowly technological framing, and a wider socio-natural-technical framing, matters for public understanding and acceptance. Would lay publics still prefer natural solutions to carbon removal, if they are informed about the inevitable technological framing and shaping of them? Research is needed about this.

To compared to 1990 levels, the greenhouse gas emission reduction target for 2030 should be increased to 55%. Bioenergy will represent 18% of total final energy consumption in 2050. Additionally, this requires the development of a long-term strategy that can force companies to completely reorganize their production or start a new operation and activities.

This article reviews the array of external policy instruments and initiatives deployed by the EU: the new trade policy of ""open strategic autonomy"" and the initiative on trade and sustainable development in the World Trade Organization (WTO); the framework for the screening of foreign direct investments and the taxonomy of environmentally sustainable investment and economic activity; new approaches to energy security and the building of global energy markets, including norms and standards for hydrogen markets; and the new neighbourhood policy, including the new strategy for Central Asia and the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument. Given the initial stage of the initiatives implementation, the study focuses on the adopted documents and planned actions. The author assesses the potential impact of climate policy internationalization instruments on EU-Russia economic cooperation and on EU leadership in shaping global climate governance. The author asserts that a number of instruments bear risks for the Russian Federation's economic projects and proposes recommendations for abating them. With regard to global governance, the EU's commitment to integrate climate goals into the global agenda may serve as a bridge for inclusive governance. At the same time, the EU's determination to impose its priorities through carrot and stick incentives, including through economic measures, on partners not sharing the EU's approach may be destructive. The author concludes that the EU's capacity to build constructive engagement with partners will be a test of the EU's real leadership. Given that the Green Deal's external dimension is intended not only to promote EU priorities and values, but also to advance the global public good, controversies arise with regard to the instruments, not the goals. Thus, it is in the interests of Russia, as well as other directly affected partners, not to oppose the export of the EU's climate policy, but to cooperate to mitigate unintended consequences of its deployment and to shape inclusive global governance.",2021.0,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,International Relations,The EUs Policies for the Green Deal Internationalization,Political science,M.,,,

Governments and private sector industries argue that climate mitigation must focus on ""decoupling"" economic growth from carbon emissions if we are to reduce climate impact while still maintaining a healthy economy. Most proponents of decoupling envisage that digitalization will play a central role in this operation. Critics, however, argue that IT has a large and often unacknowledged climate impact, while IT solutions also frequently bring new and unforeseen problems, particular or systemic. The challenge of decoupling is thus broader than the management of the relationship between the economy and the climate. As much as decoupling is about how we imagine that the climate crisis can be solved with technologies, trusting that they can create the changes we need, it is also about the cultural value of lifestyles that we do not want to change. Seeing the climate crisis from this perspective opens the door for an anthropology of digital technology, which allows us to approach decoupling as a matter of how sociocultural change is imagined in the spaces between IT, climate change and society. The article thus contributes to the qualitative social scientific literature on perceptions of change by focusing on some of the ways that implicit ideas of change are embedded in the promotion of digital technologies as solutions to climate change.

Between 2000 and 2020, China built more than 970 gigawatts of new coal power capacity, accounting for more than 70% of all new coal capacity worldwide. Building large amounts of coal and other generation capacity has continued despite clear indicators of overcapacity before the mid-2010s. This article uses a Marxian political economy theoretical framework to assert that generation overcapacity is a symptom of China's broader problem of capital overaccumulation. More specifically, it is the result of governance choices to deal with the overaccumulation problem. In so doing, this article presents a new conceptual pathway to understanding overcapacity in the electricity sector, which mainstream discourse attributes to bad planning and mistaken economic assumptions. Through the case of Chinese coal generation overcapacity, this article advocates for examining contemporary political economy issues through the conceptual lens of overaccumulation and devaluation management-in China and beyond. It proceeds by highlighting three central features of structural problems in contemporary Chinese political economy. The first is the expression of capital overaccumulation as massive coal generation overcapacity. The second is the structural bias toward overbuilding generation infrastructure; this is due both to the bulky and long-lived nature of electricity sector fixed capital and the sector's key role in circulating capital throughout the economy. The third feature is how-given insufficient consumption demand-capital is offloaded spatially, temporally, and biophysically onto migrant contract workers. Together, these features trace governance decisions made by state entities at different scales and times to deal with the imperatives of capital while maintaining economic, social, and political legitimacy. This framework highlights the ongoing management of overaccumulation and devaluation as a core governance imperative. This imperative undergirds current class warfare, and in this case of fossil fuel capital expansion, carries grim implications for climate change.",,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,"Managing the problem of too much capital: Coal power overcapacity, migrant labor sacrifice, and structural problems in contemporary Chinese political economy",Environmental studies & forestry,Xi,Xi,0.5,

1878,"Morelissen, Robin","Deltares, Hydraul Engn, Delft, Netherlands.",1.0,"The population in the Middle East Gulf area is growing and with that the water demand. In a region with very little rainfall and almost no rivers, this presents a challenge. Over the past decades, groundwater has been used as a water supply for drinking water as well as agriculture, but in many places, the groundwater reserves have been depleted. Towards the future, the dependency on seawater desalination will become larger and some areas will completely depend on this source of produced water. The total amount of desalination plants and their capacity has risen exponentially over the last few decades (Fig. 1), whereas the current production of desalinated water from reverse osmosis accounts for approximately 69% (similar to 66 million m(3)/d) of the global volume of desalinated water (similar to 95 million m(3)/d; [1]). A clear trend from thermal desalination technologies (MSF, MED) to seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) can be observed, globally and in the Middle East Gulf region specifically. This shift in technology also results in a trend in the market to decouple energy from water production. Power and desalination plants were commonly co-located in the past due to the use of thermal energy from the power production process for thermal desalination. However, an RO plant only uses electricity and can therefore be decoupled from the powerplant, both technically and economically. The main difference between the different desalination technologies in relation to the marine environment is the type and amount of brine effluent these technologies produce. Thermal desalination typically has a larger brine flow (often with elevated temperature and slightly elevated salinity of about 10%). SWRO effluent typically has no elevated temperature, but strongly elevated salinity (of about 50% or more), but the discharge rate is much less. The SWRO effluent thus provides a smaller, denser effluent plume that could result in high salinity levels near the bed, if not properly diluted by the outfall (e.g., by a diffuser). For sustainable desalination, it is important to be able to predict the effects on the environment of the discharged brine effluent when designing new desalination plants or planning plant capacity around the Gulf. Questions about this environmental impact play on different spatial and temporal scales and should be considered accordingly with suitable models and methodologies. Close to the desalination brine outfall, near field effects play an important role in the initial mixing of the effluent. Near field mixing models, like CORMIX and CFD are required to compute these non-hydrostatic effects accurately. However, these models use a simplified geometry and ambient flow conditions, relevant close to the outfall (typically about 100 m). Further away from the outfall, a far field model like Delft3D is required to predict the outfall plume dispersion and possible effects on the environment in more detail and to ensure a good, compliant outfall design. On an even larger scale, the combined effects of the desalination industry (i.e., multiple plants) should be considered, for example, on a Gulf-wide scale. Here, also the longer-term natural effects like evaporation, large-scale circulations and climate change effects play a role. Large-scale models, like the open Gulf Community Model (Fig. 2), are available to investigate and study long-term scenarios as input to a sustainable national desalination strategy. Here also important questions currently play in the Gulf region that are still subject to research: Does climate change have a larger impact on the Gulf's salinity or does the increasing desalination capacity have a larger impact? Our research shows that closer to desalination plants, an increase in capacity shows a larger impact and that in areas without brine discharges, climate change has the larger impact. On a Gulf-scale, differences average out more, but regional differences can be expected, as well as possible changes in circulations that could increase salinity and its variability in some regions, but also reduce salinity on average slightly in other areas. Knowledge from such research could also inform a sustainable desalination strategy and be downscaled to plant level again. Back to the current market dynamics for desalination plants. It is a point of attention that independent water plants (built and operated by a consortium of partners for decades) are still granted the project at the lowest metre cube water price, rather than the most sustainable design and operation. It is a challenge, but also opportunity, for water companies to put projects on the market that demand the highest levels of sustainability (in conjunction with different stakeholders like environment agencies, local communities, looking at employment etc.) in addition to an economic preference. Steps are being made in the right direction and many innovations are being developed and tested that can promote this further, like sustainable outfall designs. An example of such sustainable outfall designs could be an outfall that can double as an artificial reef. The impacts of brine discharges on the marine environment may not be as high as thought before according to our and Australian research, although it still needs careful consideration. Outfalls are often observed as covered with marine life, as being a hard substrate for life to settle on (Fig. 3). Outfalls (and intakes) could also be designed specifically with this (additional) function in mind [2]. Furthermore, not all sites around the World are equal and it is important to adopt site-specific and ecologically relevant criteria for a desalination brine outfall. Often mixing zone criteria are adopted from other parts in the world, with different ecosystems that could be either harmful to local ecosystems or be overly restrictive. Research is needed and useful to develop more relevant criteria that could be adopted by regulators and increase the sustainability of desalination in relation to the marine environment, while ensuring sufficient water for everyone in the future.",2022.0,DESALINATION PUBL,Engineering,"Sustainable desalination: how to produce sufficient water towards the future, while protecting the marine environment",Engineering & technology,Robin,Robin,0.375,

Recently, flash flooding in arid lands is occurring on almost every two-year basis and is threatening human lives and damaging properties. Modern urbanization of the cities has great impacts on flooding schemes, it increases peak streamflows and it reduces the time to peak. Eventually, major cities experienced newly developed areas to accommodate the increase of population, and thus surface runoff volumes would increase substantially. In addition to outflows from surrounding high desert lands which form a significant portion of flash flood volumes. This study proposed a modern and progressive flash flood management scheme that would emphasize on enhancing soil infiltration and runoff attenuation by construction facilities that would absorb runoff water. We formulated five proposals for flood mitigation derived from BMP techniques for the purposes of stormwater management.

It relates findings to a recent anthropological working definition of 'sustainability' that emphasises facilitating the necessary conditions for change by building and supporting diversity to address the unpredictability of the future. This definition is opposed to other current definitions that stress the preservation of existing norms. The research results presented here show that, with their decidedly future-oriented ideas and practices, the villagers of Siviri engaged with climate change adaptation projects and workshops regarding conservation and subsequently created new cultivation methods and established a marine conservation area. Additionally, they reduced their engagement in cultivation and diversified their livelihood practices. Referring to theoretical approaches connected with the 'ontological turn' in anthropology, it is argued that asking ontological questions reveals fundamental differences between the inhabitants of the village of Siviri and international and national governments and organisations in terms of their conceptualisations connected with sustainability.

These risk components were evaluated separately in Southern Italy, a formerly affected region (sensu United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification), and Northern/Central Italy, a nonaffected region in the country. All risk measures document how the divide between affected and nonaffected regions in Italy has gradually reduced. Because of local warming and rising human pressure, Northern Italy has recently displayed a level of desertification risk close to those observed in Southern Italy over the last 30 years. These results suggest a thorough revision of the national classification of risky areas, that may inform more specific mitigation and adaptation policies responding effectively to recent socioenvironmental trends and local (economic) dynamics. The intrinsic system's evolution observed at both regional and national level in Italy may be generalized to a broader European context.

These discourses of viability often invoke concrete physical limits and tipping points suggesting a transcendent natural order. Conversely, I demonstrate how viability is co-produced through political economic structures that exercise power at multiple scales in shaping the environment and understandings of how it is changing. I describe three dialectics of this co-production: epistemic/material (between ideas about viability and their biophysical and political economic conditions), epistemic/normative (between how the world is understood to be and ideas about how we should live in it), and inter-scalar (between geographic scales, where action at one scale shapes both ecologies and understandings of possible action at another). Each of these dialectics shapes the knowledge regimes that govern the ambiguous social and biophysical process of disappearance and foreclosure of livelihood possibilities in the time of climate change. I examine these discourses of viability through narratives of unviable agrarian livelihoods in coastal Bangladesh, as a lens through which to examine the dialectics of viability more broadly. I situate these discourses concretely in relation to an analysis of interdisciplinary social and natural scientific research on ecological and agrarian viability in coastal Bangladesh now and in the future. Across a broad interdisciplinary spectrum, I find that scientific attention to political economy shapes the politics of possibility. Finally, I demonstrate how discourses of viability limit alternative possible economic and ecological futures.

Birthed under colonial rule, the industry has undergone a confluence of events that have shaped its contemporary organisation and exacerbated deeply rooted institutional and structural conditions. Through the lens of environmental justice, the paper sheds light on the plural claims to justice under changing climatic conditions and reveals the politics of adaptation within the context of market capitalism. Using stakeholder interviews, the paper captures the articulations and manifestations of injustice by exploring the local perceptions of procedural justice and justice as recognition. Through an examination of power and politics, the paper begins by contextualising the pre-existing conditions that shape the disabling environment in which smallholders operate. This includes the neoliberal restructuring of the industry, smallholders' access to low farm gate prices, expensive farm inputs, low-value chain participation, and limited support services. As these conditions are exacerbated by climate change impacts, the paper then discusses the disparity in justice claims between farmers and industry stakeholders surrounding the deployment of suitable climate change adaptation response. This is an area of contestation, as even though smallholders face multiple stressors, industry leaders have continued to operate the island's major coffee-producing spaces as areas where profits can be mined and privileges reinforced. Effectively, the smallholder livelihoods embedded within Jamaica's coffee-producing landscapes have been subjected to asymmetrical structures of power which legitimise whose voices are heard and which adaptation pathway takes precedence, thus generating injustices, nurturing vulnerabilities and stifling agency.",,WILEY,Geography,Negotiating politics and power: Perspectives on environmental justice from Jamaica's specialty coffee industry,Geography,Anne-Teresa,Anne,1.0,1.0

Through a content analysis of sixteen Caribbean countries NDCs, it provides, first, a comprehensive overview of SIDS countries' perspectives on climate financing needs for mitigation and adaptation activities in meeting their climate targets. Second, the paper examines whether Caribbean SIDS acknowledge a role for domestic financing and international and domestic fiscal policy reform within their NDCs, as a way to address climate change mitigation and adaption. The analysis of Caribbean SIDS NDCs reveals that only eight countries provide clear cost estimates for mitigation activities, five for adaptation and one with a combined cost. This gives a total of US$51.3 billion for the combination of Caribbean countries across their NDCs. The majority of climate change activities identified in the NDCs are conditional on the provision of international climate finance. While some countries discuss domestic sources of finance, few note the need for domestic fiscal policy reform to counteract direct and underlying drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and their reduction. The findings suggest that, while much attention is directed to inadequate quantities of international climate finance, fiscal policy and the use of domestic finances are important for realizing transformative change and yet receive little attention from in-country policymakers. Key policy insights Caribbean SIDS suffer from a significant climate finance gap. Caribbean countries cannot remain dependent on international climate finance and must pursue more innovation and diversified options to achieve climate goals.

Scientists cite the short-term gains in air quality and health co-benefits associated with reducing SLCFs as grounds for raising the pressure on governments to eliminate SLCFs rapidly and aggressively. There is little research on whether deep SLCF mitigation during the next decade is feasible in low- and middle-income nations, particularly the hydrocarbon-based economy. This study estimates current and future emissions of potent SLCFs as methane (CH4) hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in Oman using the basic tier 1 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) greenhouse gases (GHG) inventory Guidelines of 2006. Current and future emission of black carbon (BC) was also quantified using specific emission factors. A total of 38,268 Gg of SLFCs were released into the atmosphere in Oman in 2015, accounting for 38.8% of the country's total GHG emissions, and is expected to rise significantly over the next decade to reach 67,777 Gg by 2030. The analysis reveals that the source of Oman's highly potent SLCF emissions is associated with key and critical economic sectors such as the oil and gas industry, heavy road transportation, residential air conditioning (RAC), and industrial refrigeration. These vital economic sectors impose a ""Grand Challenge"" on the immediate reduction of SLCFs in Oman and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Accomplishing a rapid, significant reduction in highly potent SLCFs from the three challenging sectors over a 5- to 10-year time period does not appear feasible or realistic in the context of international market mechanisms, socioeconomic factors, and mitigation targets. Achieving a significant reduction in SLCFs for a hydrocarbon-based economy requires a profound economic shift. Creating an effective long-term vision for a post-oil economy over the next two decades provides a sound foundation for implementing economic and societal transformation policies incorporating near-zero-emission measures for the potent SLCFs.",,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Deep near-term mitigation of short-lived climate forcers in Oman: grand challenges and prospects,Environmental studies & forestry,Yassine,Yassine,0.0,0.0

I offer a case study of how, in practice, scientists establish the reliability of model projections by assessing the dynamical adequacy of such models. I also show how process-based evaluation mitigates some well-known shortcomings of model-fit assessment and supports the adequacy and reliability of climate model projections against philosophical objections, like confirmational holism.

In California especially, the costs of wildfires have become unbearable. Current statutory solutions, such as Assembly Bill 1054 (AB-1054), focus on apportioning liability for damages between insurance companies, government programs, and the electric utilities that often spark the fires, but legislation often fails to address the factors that make damages so astronomical in the first place. In the Wildland-Urban Interface, where forests and undeveloped land meet infrastructure and housing, many older, uninsured homes in low-income communities are built with flammable material, which accelerates the intensity and spread of wildfires. These homeowners, however, lack the funding and resources necessary to retrofit their homes to fire-safe standards and updated building codes. When more wildfires inevitably start, these homes will be completely destroyed, the costs of which will be borne by the entire state. This Note offers a statutory solution that moves beyond shifts in liability. It argues that electric utilities in California should be required to engage in residential wildfire mitigation in the homes of their lowest-income ratepayers in order to be eligible for wildfire relief funds provided by AB-1054. Situating the Wildland-Urban Interface as a ""commons"" that requires collective investment, this Note proposes that each electricity user pay a statutory surcharge to fund equitable mitigation investments that will ultimately reduce California's overall wildfire-related costs.

Arguably, the biggest misconception is that critics do not separate water markets from the meta-governance institutional structures that define them. Perceived water market failures are often due to governance issues - not water trade per se. This is not to say that market failure does not exist, it does, and indeed, there are also serious distributional issues that need addressing (e.g., water property entitlements for indigenous stakeholders).

It follows that the planned 'global stocktake' of the Paris Agreement, which will assess progress toward reaching the Agreement's goals, should also cover loss and damage. Determining how the assessment for Article 8 should be framed is a question that remains largely unexplored. Doing so is challenging for at least two reasons: the prevailing knowledge gaps in loss and damage research and the contentious nature of inter-governmental negotiations about loss and damage. This article identifies the key framing questions that ought to be answered in the context of Article 8, prior to conducting the 'global stocktake'. Key among these framing questions are critical structural problems, stemming mainly from underrepresentation of Global South worldviews, and from major data gaps and methodological difficulties inherent to assessing progress with managing loss and damage. A 'global stocktake' of Article 8 provides a window of opportunity for making headway on the inter-governmental debate about loss and damage, and the direction of the research efforts that are needed to inform such debate. This article concludes by reflecting on the stakes that developing countries have in that window of opportunity. Key policy insights Imperfect as its output might be, the first global stocktake under the Paris Agreement can help identify and act upon the key barriers that today prevent us from conducting a comprehensive assessment of progress with regard to the goals of Article 8 on loss and damage.

Based on a survey and empirical analysis, this study identifies the key determinants of farmers' agricultural water-saving behavior, particularly to verify whether collecting water fees helps to promote agricultural water-saving. A structured questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 660 farmers in South China with seasonal water shortage. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine the determinants.

Of all 47 Kenyan counties, 23 are classified as arid and semi-arid (ASAL), constituting approximately 88% of the country's land mass. Like in many developing countries, droughts in Kenya are well known to affect provision of food. They also have the potential to affect infrastructure services. Kenya has an infrastructure deficit, meaning that a large portion of the infrastructure has not been significantly developed, being exposed to major risks emanating from natural disasters. When droughts occur, infrastructure is exposed to further risks of structural damage and deterioration, leading to increased maintenance costs. In addition, users must travel longer distances and spend more time in order to have access to infrastructure services. This paper discusses how droughts affect users of infrastructure services. The survey is based on a primary study carried out in 1370 households across 27 counties of Kenya. It also relies on secondary data, including from the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey (KIHBS) for 2015/16, reflecting access to basic infrastructure services across the surveyed 27 counties. The research findings illustrate that droughts reduce access to infrastructure services such as energy, water provision, housing and communications, thus requiring climate-sensitive policy interventions.

It is distinguished by the absence of not transparences elements. As the initial data, the actual background concentrations (according to WMO data), the annual ceiling of greenhouse gas emissions and the maximum permissible emissions of toxic compounds, information on the characteristics of emission sources are taken for the enterprise, and as operational constants, the global warming potentials of greenhouse gases (GWP100) and officially approved values of maximum permissible concentrations of toxic compounds (MPC). The method is based on the equation (presented here at annotation in a simplified form), which gives a numerical indicator (rating) R of the efficiency of a production facility in terms of hazardous emissions into the atmosphere, taking into account greenhouse gases and energy costs arising from their removal. Currently, the technique is adapted to the energy sector; for wider adaptation to various industries, a low-carbon rating program has been drawn up for boiler houses, thermal power plants and industrial enterprises. It also meets the needs of understanding and predicting possible deviations of emission parameters from the standardized indicators. Therefore, it can serve as a tool within the framework of ISO 50001, providing objective control over the choice of means to ensure compliance with the requirements for harmful components emissions including greenhouse gases in the design and modernization of production facilities.

Yet, the intersection between unsustainable development, disasters and displacement remains inadequately examined. The context that enables the nexus between un-sustainable development and disasters to form, and the implications it carries for addressing displacement raises complex governance challenges.This article aims to promote greater reflections on such context and some of these challenges by examining the case of 2021 Atami mudslide disaster in Japan, where the collapse of inappro-priately constructed landfill located on top of the affected area has been identified as a major factor. The analysis considers the underlying circumstances within which this disaster occurred by examining relevant legacies from Japan's post-war developmentalist era. It also reviews relevant policy and regulatory frameworks pertaining to territorial development and disaster risk reduction and management, revealing how fragmentation between these policy domains impact on the ability to address displacement in multi-hazard situations.

Interactions among edaphic stresses may be characterized by dominance of one stress over others, neutral interactions whose effects are additive, mitigating interactions in which the effects of multiple stresses are less than additive, potentiating interactions in which the effects of multiple stresses are greater than additive, and dynamic equilibria in which plant responses seek to minimize all stresses concurrently. Existing theoretical paradigms, notably the Law of the Minimum and the Multiple Limitation Hypothesis, do not adequately account for interactions of edaphic stresses. Reduced growth resulting from edaphic stress is itself an important modulator of stress interactions by reducing resource demand as well as reducing soil resource capture. Root adaptations to one edaphic stress may either mitigate or potentiate other edaphic stresses, as evidenced by the examples of root architectural tradeoffs for water and P capture, in contrast to root architectural synergies for water and nitrate capture. In high-input agroecosystems, edaphic stress complexes of global importance include mechanical impedance/poor soil structure/drought stress, and salinity/drought stress. In low-input agroecosystems, globally important edaphic stress complexes include drought and low soil P availability, as well as the acid soil complex, characterized by toxicity of Al and possibly Mn, combined with low availability of P, K, Ca, and Mg. Global climate change is likely to exacerbate edaphic stress, by increasing the severity and frequency of drought and flooding, accelerating soil degradation, and altering plant phenology. Many of the edaphic stresses exacerbated by global climate change have potentiating interactions with each other, which is likely to make them more harmful than anticipated from their direct effects. Edaphic stresses linked to climate change are likely to have severe impacts in developing nations, which generally have more problematic soils and more limited management options than developed nations. The potential benefits of CO2 fertilization for plants in future climates may be mitigated by edaphic stress. Edaphic stress interactions are a challenge for crop breeding programs, because resistance to edaphic stress is generally quantitative and may display fitness tradeoffs with other edaphic stresses. Germplasm evaluation in farmer's conditions, ideotype breeding, and deployment of root phenotypes with utility for multiple edaphic stresses, such as long, dense root hairs, and root cortical aerenchyma, would be helpful in this context.

Clubs, players and fans increasingly call for action to reduce football's impact on the climate, and for plans to adapt to climate impacts on football. However, well-intentioned actions must be underpinned by robust evidence. This synthesis reviews research at the interface of football and climate change. After summarizing the main climate actions identified for fans, players, clubs and organizing bodies, the review looks in-depth at four areas: impacts of football on climate; impacts of climate on football; football as a driver for pro-climate actions; and the relationship between football and carbon-intensive industries. The review then outlines research gaps for an evidence-driven response to climate change in football: adaptation across different geographical contexts; understanding what climate change means for community-level football; understanding how carbon-intensive industries relate to sense of place identity in football under a just transition; developing principles for phasing-out fossil fuel financing; and considering how climate change relates to women's football.Key policy insightsFootball is a forum for galvanizing societal action in support of climate policy. However, football also contributes to, and is impacted by, climate change, and hence requires policy support under a changing climate;Reducing transportation emissions, especially flying, is a key climate policy requirement for football.

Adaptation theory and practice have begun to focus on change agents, people who can help catalyse this change, but it is poorly understood why some people are better able to influence positive systemic change or how climate adaptation projects cultivate and assist them in doing so. This paper synthesises insights on good practice for intervention design and implementation from a wide range of intervention literature domains, including health, education and international development. It identifies a distilled set of individual and collective change agent characteristics and competencies, grouped into five interconnecting themes: values, learning approaches, efficacy, roles and entrepreneurial tendencies. Nine core competencies are identified as important for enabling change, clustered into three themes: being good with people, learning or mastery skills, and adaptation competencies. The review also collates insights about how best to cultivate an agent's capacity for catalysing change, with a particular focus on the potential for enabling climate adaptation through research for development. Initial insights suggest that capacity building needs to be more than developing new technical knowledge and skills; it should also focus on developing the necessary competencies for enabling change in intervention teams and potential change agents.

For these reasons, the aviation industry faces significant challenges including fuel costs, along with environmental and energy security problems arising from the use of petroleum-based jet fuel. At present, there are numerous strategies to improve energy efficiency, while also tackling environmental problems, including alternative fuel solutions and innovative battery technologies. Alternative fuels are attractive because they help address energy and environmental challenges, allowing for the advancement of sustainable aviation. They hold the potential to improve air quality and slow down global climate changes, while expanding access to domestic energy sources with the diversification of fuel supplies. Alternative fuels may also contribute to price and supply stability, and help to stimulate economic development in rural communities. Electrification and decarbonization of aircrafts also offer numerous advantages, including less energy consumption, lower GHG emissions, less noise production compared to conventional aircrafts, and more reliable electric subsystems. However, production rates of available sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technologies can meet only a portion of the market size of the commercial aviation industry. Similarly, short-range all-electric aircrafts, while having great potential to reduce environmental impacts, will still require significant improvements in battery technologies to remain cost-competitive. The purpose of this study is to make a comparative assessment of alternative fuels used in the aviation industry and electric aircrafts designed in accordance with battery technologies for the purpose of emission reduction. According to the case study discussed herein, it can be concluded that SAFs used in commercial airplanes offer a long term, environment-friendly solution, while battery technologies require further developments for safety and reliability. In addition, it is necessary to investigate the operational parameters of batteries such as energy density, weight, operating temperature and battery recycling, and to analyze environmental effects and emission release of battery technologies from production to recycling of batteries, for a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of this latter proposed solution to solve the current negative consequences of a booming aviation industry.",,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,Thermodynamics,Comparative energy and environmental assessment of battery technologies and alternative fuels in sustainable aviation,Physics,Nadir,Nadir,0.25,0.0

Recently, some sympathetic critics have worried that, together with its often-contentious tenor, this polyvocality renders CJ incoherent and/or ill-suited to legal and policy application. Divergent choices of framing and means do matter, since they entail implications for the development of constituencies, alliances, and political, legal, and/or policy action. This paper argues, however, that rather than incoherence, the variation, fluidity, and complexity of CJ evidence logical adaptations to differing positionalities and circumstances, made necessary by the multiple, geographically varying dimensions of climate injustice. Critical political geographic perspectives (which happen to complement those of many movement adherents) help to expose this adaptive logic. Correspondingly, diverse articulations of CJ and their implications help show how political spaces and ecologies matter in contesting the multiple inequalities and power moves with which climate injustice is intertwined. Moreover, recent public health analyses and testimonies from affected groups suggest that shared experiences of rising, disproportionate climate-related death and other forms of individual and collective loss increasingly underpin and motivate CJ's multiple forms. The trajectories of compounding loss, still-rising greenhouse gas emissions, and the growing hegemony of CJ in a variety of settings underscore the need for continuing development of extensive solidarities among dispersed and differently positioned affected groups and potential allies.

However, CSA adoption remains low in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other developing regions due to resource constraints and weak agricultural extension systems, among other factors. To reverse this trend and increase CSA adoption, the use of participatory extension services like farmer extension facilitators (FEFs) are increasingly viewed as a pathway to improving extension services in rural communities in SSA and elsewhere. Yet, rigorous analyses of the impacts of the FEF approach as a pathway for CSA adoption remain limited. Here we estimate the impacts of the FEF approach on CSA adoption in terms of resource intensity of CSA practices promoted by FEFs through a large CSA-related intervention in southern Malawi. We apply recursive bivariate probit regression to primary survey data from a sample of 808 households across five districts in the project area across southern Malawi in 2016, accounting for endogeneity and selection bias in farmer interaction with FEFs and the impact of the FEF approach on CSA adoption. Results show that interaction with FEFs had a positive and statistically-significant impact on CSA adoption; low, medium, and high resource intensity CSA categories increased by 42%, 87%, and 96%, respectively. The results suggest that the FEF approach can significantly enhance CSA adoption and thereby contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, including climate action in Malawi, similar contexts in SSA, and elsewhere.

Since macrophysiology, or the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation, is well-established and approaching its third decade, these questions are posed for it here. The field is, of course, much older, but, over the last two decades, has contributed substantially to fundamental eco-evolutionary research and to understanding the conservation consequences of physiological variation at regional and global scales. Its greatest successes have been in understanding variation in thermal and metabolic responses of animals and plants to variable environments and the significance thereof in the context of the climate crisis. By contrast, much less progress has been made in understanding the regulation of water in the context of currently changing environments and projections of further impacts associated with ongoing global change. The development of new datasets of physiological traits across broad spatial scales has been a slower enterprise than the further compilation of trait databases from extant data. Surprising insights have emerged from genomics-based microbial macrophysiology, an approach which has much potential to span all of life's variety. The findings of macrophysiological investigations have been taken up within policy reports and/or implementation actions, such as those of the IPCC and the Antarctic Treaty System, that have resulted in benefits to society and to the environment.

However, there is often a narrow focus on specific aspects, bearing the risk that tensions and trade-offs for policy are easily overlooked, and sometimes involving a loose, implicit, inconsistent, or uncritical use of the term justice. I argue to clearly separate the empirical analysis of inequalities from their normative assessment, and to adequately consider the large variety of potentially relevant inequalities as well as the variety of justice principles. In support of such an approach, this article suggests categorizations of (1) basic dimensions of social inequality in the context of climate and environment; (2) different social impacts of climate and environmental policies; and (3) different justice principles. The overall aim is to have typologies and an organizing framework at hand that help to systematically identify a broad range of inequalities which can then be discussed against different justice principles. This shall allow a better detection of intersectionality and policy trade-offs as well as broader-based normative judgments in research and in policy assessments (evaluations). Key policy insights To consider social justice in the context of climate policy, it is key to acknowledge the large variety of inequalities along different dimensions and impact categories, including intersectionality and trade-offs. Many claims about (in)justice of a specific policy or a transition do not reflect this variety. Policy impact assessments and evaluations should make a clearer distinction between social change processes and human impacts.

Using content analysis of the plans and interviews with past and current sustainability directors in each of the cities and a small number of participants, I provide context for how the updated plans addressed the three aspects of equity. Further, I call into question how academics have defined procedural equity. The experiences of these five cities revealed that three actions essential to achieving authentic participation are antiracism training, comprehensive efforts to bring underrepresented groups to the table, and creating a planning process in which participants are valued. The bottom line in all three is that procedural equity is a trust-building process. Participants in these planning processes viewed acknowledging previous rounds of harm committed in frontline communities as a first step in prioritizing equity. Although distributional equity is defined through implementation, the plans of these five cities, to varying degrees, attempted to stipulate how equitable implementation of goals will be measured. Takeaway for practice Developing climate plans that emphasize equity requires a considerable upfront commitment to building authentic participation from frontline communities and ensuring that it is measured in implementation.",2022.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Public Administration,Transitioning From Urban Climate Action to Climate Equity,Public administration,Joan,Joan,1.0,1.0

The complexity and diversity of current and future demands (biomedical applications, HVAC, smart buildings, climate change adapted cities, etc.) require making the thermal characterization methods used in laboratory more accessible and portable, by miniaturizing, automating, and connecting them. Designing new materials with innovative thermal properties or studying the thermal properties of biological tissues often require the use of miniaturized and non-invasive sensors, capable of accurately measuring the thermal properties of small quantities of materials. In this context, miniature electro-thermal resistive sensors are particularly well suited, in both material science and biomedical instrumentation, both in vitro and in vivo. This paper presents a one-dimensional (1D) electro-thermal systemic modeling of miniature thermistor bead-type sensors. A Godunov-SPICE discretization scheme is introduced, which allows for very efficient modeling of the entire system (control and signal processing circuits, sensors, and materials to be characterized) in a single workspace. The present modeling is applied to the thermal characterization of different biocompatible liquids (glycerol, water, and glycerol-water mixtures) using a miniature bead-type thermistor. The numerical results are in very good agreement with the experimental ones, demonstrating the relevance of the present modeling. A new quasi-absolute thermal characterization method is then reported and discussed.

Forest companies claim that plantations were established on eroded lands. However, the plantation industry is under suspicion to have expanded its activities by clearing near-natural forests since the early 1970s. This paper uses a methodologically complex classification approach from own previously published research to elucidate land use dynamics in southern Chile. It uses spatial data (extended morphological profiles) in addition to spectral data from historical Landsat imagery, which are fusioned by kernel composition and then classified in a multiple classifier system (based on support, import and relevance vector machines). In a large study area (similar to 67,000 km(2)), land use change is investigated in a narrow time frame (five-year steps from 1975 to 2010) in a twoway (prospective and retrospective) analysis. The results are discussed synoptically with other results on Chile. Two conclusions can be drawn for the coastal range. Near-natural forests have always been felled primarily in favor of the plantation industry. Vice versa, industrial plantations have always been primarily established on sites, that were formerly forest covered. This refutes the claim that Chilean plantations were established primarily to restore eroded lands; also known as badlands. The article further shows that Chile is not an isolated case of deforestation by afforestation, which has occurred in other countries alike. Based on the findings, it raises the question of the extent to which the Chilean example could be replicated in other countries through afforestation by market economy and climate change mitigation.",2022.0,MDPI,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Deforestation by Afforestation: Land Use Change in the Coastal Range of Chile,Environmental studies & forestry,Andreas C.,Andreas,0.0,0.0

Therefore, understanding the impact of building design on construction cost and the carbon footprint associated with offsite construction is important for the improved sustainability and climate resilience of the built environment. This study aims to develop a system approach, with the aid of building information modeling (BIM), for 3D geometric modeling and automatic generative design toward optimizing the carbon footprint and construction cost from offsite construction. A mathematical formulation is proposed to represent the topological relationships between different kinds of precast and cast-in-situ elements, which in turn, underpin 3D geometric modeling for possible geometric variations within precast buildings. New generative algorithms are developed to automatically manipulate building geometrics subject to pre-defined constraints, and create parametric BIM models in compliance with material types assigned by users. A BIM-based automation tool is developed to extract and match the model geometry/material information with a customized BIM object library, through which carbon emission factors and cost coefficients can be retrieved for multi-criteria sustainability analysis. The proposed new approach empowers 3D geometric modeling and geometry-based design automation, which enable comprehensive exploration of design alternates in precast construction. The proposed new method is illustrated via a case study that investigates the impact of different design variations on embodied carbon and construction cost of precast structures. The proposed BIM development takes around 30 minutes to create 1,000-1,500 new design options. Besides, it produces design options that contain a 30% less carbon footprint and construction cost than reference buildings from the literature. The results indicate that our proposed method can support automated design exploration at early stages, which help to identify optimal solutions for more informed decision making.",2022.0,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,Construction & Building Technology,BIM-Based Building Geometric Modeling and Automatic Generative Design for Sustainable Offsite Construction,Engineering & technology,Vincent J.

It documents the origins of the Ramsar Convention and the changes in the criteria for defining wetlands of international importance from an emphasis on migratory birds to those of wider functional importance contributing to community well-being. This led to a significant increase in the number of signatories from developing countries The change in scientific emphasis from ecology to ecosystems (and ecosystem services) is identified as a key element of the wetland paradigm shift, which has occurred in the last half century and renewed the recognition of the importance of the natural capital of wetlands. It represents a change in research agenda from what wetlands are to what wetlands do. Modification of the Ramsar wise use concept is documented, and evolution of wetland assessment methods is traced in relation to policy development and the need for a strong science evidence base to improve decision-making connected with wetland conservation and management. The author also addresses the significance of wetland economic valuation and biodiversity issues, transboundary water management with particular reference to the marshlands of Mesopotamia (southern Iraq), conflict, and human livelihood issues. Examples are given of the drive towards wetland restoration in different countries, and at different scales, with awareness of the extraordinarily high costs associated with major schemes such as the Florida Everglades which may prohibit replication in other parts of the world. Adoption of the Ecosystem Approach and the ""Wholescapes"" concept are seen as important in the future management of wetland ecosystems. The wide-ranging interactions within the structure of a new wetland paradigm are summarized diagrammatically. An examination of current societal priorities and challenges resulting from the nexus of issues arising from food production, energy, water, and environmental change and health suggests both significant threats to wetlands, but also some opportunities for these ecosystems to play a part in sustainable solutions contributing to human well-being. The paper concludes with an endorsement of a new World Charter for wetlands but emphasizes the vital importance of partnership working and the key engagement of local communities to make any new initiative for enhanced protection and management of wetlands to work on the ground.

Determination of drought beforehand is vital for optimal management of water resources. Many different methods have been developed to detect drought. Sequential association analysis is used for the data series analysis containing time information and is one of the methods used to determine the drought. A correlation can be established between the values taken by the data at different times when determining association rules with this method. The primary purpose of this study is to determine the sequential association patterns between precipitation and climate oscillation index for Aras Basin. The Aras basin is a region where irrigation and animal husbandry are common. Today, many dams and hydroelectric power plants, together with the increasing population, meet the water and energy needs. A possible drought event in this region will adversely affect the living things in the basin. Therefore, the study focused on this basin. Finding sequential associations between precipitation and climate oscillation index can determine the temporal correlations between these parameters and specifically detect drought. The MOWCATL (Minimal Occurren-ces with Constraints and Time Lags) algorithm was used to detect sequential associations, and the J-measure was used to evaluate the patterns in the study. Sequential association patterns were determined by applying this method to the precipitation data obtained from 6 meteorology stations in the Aras basin. AO (Arctic Oscillation) Index, MEI (Mul-tivariate ENSO) Index, NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) Index, Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) Index, PNA (Pacific/North American), and SOI (Southern Oscillation Index), followed by the 1, 3, 6 and 12-month Agricultural Standardized Precipitation Index (a-SPI) were used in sequential association. The study results revealed that the antecedent parameters were ineffective in detecting arid conditions in Ardahan and Dogubeyazit stations, and they were influential on drought conditions, especially in a-SPI-3 and a-SPI-12 month periods at other stations. Although the altitude and geographical features are different, similar climatic patterns have been detected in some stations.

However, this infrastructure is repeatedly planned, implemented and researched almost entirely based on the goals of stormwater management. Thus, more knowledge is required about how co-benefits are perceived and actioned by planning actors. By investigating co-benefits from a value perspective, this paper will contribute to the ongoing debate on how stormwater planning actors address the potential co-benefits and conflicts in the planning and implementation of BGI. The data are derived from policy document analyses and interviews with municipal and private planning actors in Bergen and Tromso, Norway. The paper argues that municipal water actors are motivated to implement BGI beyond stormwater management goals and approach co-benefits and holistic stormwater management as an ideal in stormwater planning. However, the tensions and conflicts between the co-benefits become more evident in the actual implementation of BGI. The paper finds that when holistic BGI implementation is initiated by the municipal water actors, the stormwater management aspects dominate the BGI implementation. Finally, the paper concludes that even though blue and green values and interests are often conflicted in the implementation of BGI, urban stormwater planning is in the process of developing a blue-green value set based on the potential synergies of co-benefits. The paper therefore empirically illustrates how collective values and interests can develop and unfold across sectors and professional disciplines in BGI planning.",,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Co-benefits and conflicts in alternative stormwater planning: Blue versus green infrastructure?,Environmental studies & forestry,Hanna,Hanna,1.0,1.0

This article aims to contribute to this theoretical discussion by assessing how the concept could be applied to technology transfer obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). While the UNFCCC's technology transfer obligations are framed within the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities, this article proposes that application of an additional legal principle of fair and equitable benefit-sharing could not only be possible but also bring added value to the regime. Following an analysis of the concept's key features and the legal framework for technology transfer under the UNFCCC, the basis for conceptualizing inter-State climate technology transfer as benefit-sharing is examined. The potential significance and value of incorporating benefit-sharing principles into this legal and policy context is then evaluated. From a procedural standpoint, it could reinforce the need to understand local perspectives and engage in collaborative approaches. In terms of its substantive implications, a benefit-sharing lens could also inform and bridge understandings of equity, promote diversification of implementation approaches and encourage more transformative forms of technological capacity-building.",,WILEY,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Inter-State climate technology transfer under the UNFCCC: A benefit-sharing approach,Environmental studies & forestry,Nicola,Nicola,0.8333333333333334,1.0

Recognizing that developing countries are on the receiving end of implementation projects, this review highlights historical understanding of the constituents of capacity building initiatives and how these can advance humanity towards the global good of decelerating, and even reversing, the adverse impacts of climate change. In particular, the article describes the institutionalization of capacity building since the establishment of the international climate change regime and highlights some of the stances of the Brazilian environmental diplomacy in this process. Furthermore, it emphasizes initiatives taken by developing countries to empower their citizens and to serve as a mainstay for enhancing South-South cooperation by sharing climate-friendly practices and capabilities.

Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is a mode of photosynthesis that evolved in response to decreasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere some 20 million years ago. An elevated ratio of O-2 relative to CO2 caused many plants to face increasing stress from photorespiration, a process exacerbated for plants living under high temperatures or in water-limited environments. Today, our climate is again rapidly changing and plants' ability to cope with and adapt to these novel environments is critical for their success. This review focuses on CAM plant responses to abiotic stressors likely to dominate in our changing climate: increasing CO2 levels, increasing temperatures, and greater variability in drought. Empirical studies that have assessed CAM responses are reviewed, though notably these are concentrated in relatively few CAM lineages. Other aspects of CAM biology, including the effects of abiotic stress on the light reactions and the role of leaf succulence, are also considered in the context of climate change. Finally, more recent studies using genomic techniques are discussed to link physiological changes in CAM plants with the underlying molecular mechanism. Together, the body of work reviewed suggests that CAM plants will continue to thrive in certain environments under elevated CO2. However, how CO2 interacts with other environmental factors, how those interactions affect CAM plants, and whether all CAM plants will be equally affected remain outstanding questions regarding the evolution of CAM on a changing planet.",2022.0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,Plant Sciences,"Evolution of Crassulacean acid metabolism in response to the environment: past, present, and future",Biology,Karolina,Karolina,1.0,1.0

This article argues that policy action that aims to reach a minimum level of effective carbon prices can increase countries' ability to implement ambitious climate change policies, including carbon taxes and emission trading schemes (ETSs). Effective carbon prices include prices applied via energy taxes, fossil fuel subsidies, carbon taxes, and ETSs. Action on effective carbon prices can create new synergies among government departments - thereby strengthening their capacity to implement climate policies. Policy action on effective carbon pricing can also integrate finance ministries more directly in climate change policy than focusing exclusively on explicit carbon pricing. Lastly, acting on effective carbon pricing can broaden countries' engagement in carbon pricing policy compared to focusing exclusively on explicit carbon pricing. Civil society actors, governments, and international organizations could foster higher ambition on climate policy by promoting action on effective carbon prices. The article also highlights that analyses of effective carbon pricing gaps - which measure differences between current effective carbon prices and benchmark prices needed to meet the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement - need to be carefully communicated and interpreted so as to avoid undermining climate change policy. Key policy insights Policy action on effective carbon prices can unlock in-house synergies in countries that have substantial experience with energy and environmental policy but not in climate policy.

Unlike most other flood prediction methods, the approach here does not use any predetermined probability distribution function of extreme events, and instead a random sampling of past data represents tides and storm surges. The probability of flooding for 3 different flood levels and 3 different SLR projections are calculated, and the results are consistent with more sophisticated methods. Under intermediate-low SLR projection an empirical formula is found to estimate the lower bound of flooding time, showing that water level that exceeds the high tide (Mean Higher High Water, MHHW) occurred similar to 0.3% of the time in the 1960s, increased to similar to 6% in 2021, and projected to occur 100% of the time by similar to 2080. Under intermediate SLR projection, 1000 simulations of the probability of maximum annual water level were conducted, showing that storm surges may reach similar to 2 m over MHHW by 2050 and similar to 3 m over MHHW by 2100; in comparison, storm surges in Norfolk over the past 90 years reached 1.6 m only once.

To clarify its strengths and weaknesses, I first set out cultural theory and explain how the notion of clumsy solutions was derived from it.

I do so by breaking up the application of this concept into seven predictions, concerning: (1) the major perspectives among stakeholders on how to resolve climate change; (2) the fate of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol; (3) the feasibility of international emissions trading; (4) the possibility of making renewable energy competitive; (5) the need for domestic governmental action to realize this possibility; (6) the effectiveness of a nonbinding global treaty to combat climate change; and (7) the need to explore adaptation, carbon capture, and geoengineering.

Drawing on assemblage theory and social network analysis in a novel way, this study explores the influence of Oregonian small farmers' social and informational networks on their beliefs about and responses to climate change. The use of assemblage theory, which focuses on many disparate elements as they co-function in a space, allows for multiple entities within farmers' networks and the ways they interact to be examined, while the use of social network analysis highlights broader patterns in the structure and composition of farmers' networks. Theoretically, this study brings these two distinct yet similar bodies of theory and methodologies together for the first time to expand the utility of both fields and explore farmers' networks in a novel way. Results indicate that small farmers' connections to other farmers and media in their networks are influencing their beliefs about climate change, while their responses are influenced by their ties to various agricultural and climatological information sources, as well as other nearby farmers. Finally, while farmers' ties to other farmers are largely limited to those nearby, certain central individuals and entities, particularly beginning farmers, can act as bridges linking distinct groups of farmers.

I draw on an extended case study of farmers and agricultural advisors in Siskiyou County to understand how rural agriculturalists perceive risks when navigating climate change discourses. While farmers are changing their management practices in response to the physical effects of climate change, many perceive substantial social risks within their communities if they align themselves publicly with climate change beliefs or actions. Perceived social consequences included loss of access to the benefits of membership in formal and informal farming groups. Efforts focused on educating or convincing farmers of climate science may, in some contexts, increase rather than decrease the perceived social risks of climate action. The framing of climate policies, programs, and practices - especially by public agricultural advisors like Cooperative Extension Advisors and local USDA staff (e.g., Farm Service Agency) - is important not only for increasing farmer participation, but also for reducing perceived social risks associated with climate change.

Similarly, the average maize productivity of married women is about 28.5% higher than that of unmarried women. This suggests that married men and women have greater adaptive capacity than their counterparts and are also more likely to improve their productivity. The factors that contribute to the performance of married men and women at the expense of their counterparts are secondary education, producer assets, and climate information. We also find that the use of improved seeds, off-season cropping, and a combination of both strategies are the types of coping strategies adopted by men and married women to increase their productivity.

This is complicated by law, which on the one hand is thought of as a vehicle to help institutionalise adaptative capacity, but on the other embodies and amplifies property rights.

Interviewees included actors in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change negotiations, small island developing states (SIDS) and developing country representatives, nongovernmental organisations (NGO), Executive Committee members of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), multilateral organisations, environmental actors in the private sector, and developed countries.

The paper offers insights into where opinions of interviewees align or misalign and inform a way forward for L&D funding in a politically sensitive environment. The majority of interviewees believed that L&D funds should be mobilised through the 'polluter pays principle' to finance components of a L&D mechanism that relate to a) adaptation and disaster risk reduction, b) insurance and c) solidarity. The Green Climate Fund or the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage have the potential to play an administrative role in a L&D finance mechanism.

However, while certain agency exercises of climate change discretion have received considerable commentary, less attention has been paid to the ability offederal and state agencies and tribes to promote what this Article terms ""climate change plus"" (CC+) industries-that is, new, emerging, or expanding industries that can assist climate change mitigation or adaptation (or both) despite not being obviously connected to climate change. Therefore, unlike renewable energy, these industries are unlikely to inspire major legislative changes in policy or new statutory incentive programs as part of a larger climate change initiative. Nevertheless, these industries can still contribute to the nation's efforts to meet climate change mitigation and adaptation goals, underscoring why the administrative state needs to carefully evaluate such industries through a climate change lens when exercising regulatory discretion. This Article focuses on U.S. marine aquaculture (mariculture) as a rapidly expanding industry in need of CC+ administrative evaluation, because certain aspects of this industry deserve selective promotion as part of a national climate change policy. Marine aquaculture is recognized worldwide as an increasingly critical facet of food security. However, many kinds of mariculture also contribute to climate change mitigation, coastal adaptation, and water quality improvement.

There has been an increase in the number of published papers but there is an uneven geographical distribution of research. Studies vary in the way they treat gender: with an almost even split between modeling-based studies, where gender is one of many variables to be correlated with, or to determine, an outcome (e.g., poverty-for example, as a dummy variable in regressions); and studies where the expressed aim is to look at gender differences, whether through the gender of an individual or the gender of a household head. Clusters of papers look at gender differences in assets, health, perceptions of environmental degradation, agricultural perceptions and outcomes, and climate change perceptions, vulnerability, and adaptation. There is also a number of papers exploring women's empowerment, including intra-household decision making. Intersectional approaches have been employed both through modeling studies and through more in-depth qualitative studies that are able to trace changes in identity over time, and the implications therein.

The economic effects of border carbon adjustments (BCAs) to protect energy-intensive Korean industries in the process of achieving the carbon reduction target by 2030 through the Korean ETS are also analyzed. Design/methodology - First, using the Korean Input-Output (JO) table, this paper calculates the balance of emissions embodied in trade (BEET) and the pollution terms of trade (PTT) to determine Korean industries' carbon leakage status. Analyses of the risk level posed by carbon reduction policy implementation in international trade are conducted for some sectors by applying the EU criteria. Second, using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, three BCA scenarios, exemption regulations (EXE), reimbursement (REB), and tariff reduction (TAR) to protect the energy-intensive industries under the Korean ETS are addressed. Compared to the baseline scenario of achieving carbon reduction targets by 2030, the effects of BCAs on welfare, carbon leakage, outputs, and trading are analyzed. Findings - As Korea's industrial structure has been transitioning from a carbon importing to a carbon leaking country. The results indicate that some industrial sectors could face the risk of losing international competitiveness due to the Korean ETS. South Korea's industries are basically exposed to risk of carbon leakage because most industries have a trade intensity higher than 30%. This could be interpreted as disproving vulnerability to carbon leakage. Although the petroleum and coal sector is not in carbon leakage, according to BEET and PTT, the Korean ETS exposes this sector to a high risk of carbon leakage. Non-metallic minerals and iron and steel sectors are also exposed to a high risk of carbon leakage due to the increased burden of carbon reduction costs embodied in the Korean ETS, despite relatively low levels of trade intensity. BCAs are demonstrated to have an influential role in protecting energy-intensive industries while achieving the carbon reduction target by 2030. The EXE scenario has the greatest impact on mitigation of welfare losses and carbon leakage, and the TAF scenario causes a disturbance in the international trade market because of the pricing adjustment system. In reality, the EXE scenario, which implies completely exempting energy-intensive industries, could be difficult to implement due to various practical constraints, such as equity and reduction targets and other industries; therefore, the REB scenario presents the most realistic approach and appears to have an effect that could compensate for the burden of economic activities and emissions regulations in these industries. Originality/value - This paper confirms the vulnerability of the Korean industrial the risk of carbon leakage, demonstrating that some industrial sectors could be exposed to losing international competitiveness by implementing carbon reduction policies such as the Korean ETS. The contribution of this paper is the identification of proposed approaches to protect Korean industries in the process of achieving the 2030 reduction target by analyzing the effects of BCA scenarios using a CGE model.",2022.0,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,Business & Economics,Risk of Carbon Leakage and Border Carbon Adjustments under the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme,Economics,Kyungsoo,Kyungsoo,,

A variant of such justice - distributive justice - emphasises recipient countries' vulnerability to be an important consideration in funding allocation. The extent to which this principle is pursued in practice has been of widespread and ongoing concerns. Empirical evidence in this regard however remains inadequate and methodologically weak. This research examined the effect of recipients' climate vulnerability on the allocation of climate funds by controlling for other commonly-identified determinants. A dynamic panel regression method based on Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) was used on a longitudinal dataset, containing approved funds for more than 100,000 projects covering three areas of climate action (mitigation, adaptation, and overlap) in 133 countries over two decades (2000-2018). Findings indicated a non-significant effect of recipients' vulnerability on mitigation funding, but significant positive effects on adaptation and overlap fundings. 'Most vulnerable' countries were likely to receive higher amounts of these two types of funding than the 'least vulnerable' countries. All these provided evidence of distributive justice. However, the relationship between vulnerability and funding was parabolic, suggesting 'moderately vulnerable' countries likely to receive more funding than the 'most vulnerable' countries. Whilst, for mitigation funding, this observation was not a reason for concern, for adaptation and overlap fundings this was not in complete harmony with distributive justice. Paradoxically, countries with better investment readiness were likely to receive more adaptation and overlap funds. In discordance with distributive justice, countries within the Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia regions, despite their higher climatic vulnerabilities, were likely to receive significantly less adaptation and overlap fundings. Effects of vulnerability were persistent, and past funding had significant effects on current funding. These, coupled with the impact of readiness, suggested a probable Low Funding Trap for the world's most vulnerable countries. The overarching conclusion is that, although positive changes have occurred since the 2015 Paris Agreement, considerable challenges to distributive justice remain.

1992,"Khiyat, Ziad","Econ & Social Commiss Western Asia UN ESCWA, Beirut, Lebanon.",1.0,"The Arab region is one of the most water scarce regions in the world with 19 states below the water scarcity threshold including 13 states below the absolute water scarcity. Groundwater is heavily relied upon and it is the primary source of freshwater in more than 11 Arab States, yet the invisible and complex character of groundwater being underground and out of sight has not given it the due attention it deserves. Hence, this report explores the importance of groundwater and the challenges it is facing, with the aim of bolstering its status to a strategic resource for the Arab region. Amid the water scarcity situation, limited renewable groundwater resources continue to be exploited at an unsustainable rate, exceeding the natural recharge rates. Excessive use of groundwater, especially by the agricultural sector combined with low efficiency, has led to the decline in groundwater storage in more than two thirds of the Arab region, where the area of decline has doubled in 2018-2019 compared to 2002. In some countries over 88% of all irrigation water comes from groundwater compared to a global average of just over 37%. Moreover, it is projected that by 2050, available groundwater per capita will have decreased by more than half since the beginning of the century and 17 Arab States, accounting for 79% of the total population, will be below the absolute water scarcity threshold. In addition to their excessive use, groundwater resources are also threatened by anthropo-genic pollution sources, from agricultural and industrial practices and from sea water intrusion in coastal cities. The deterioration in the quality of groundwater resources, both due to overexploita-tion and pollution is aggravating the problem of water scarcity. For example, in Beirut, seawater intrusion has shifted inland between 500 and 1,200 m from 1970 reference point. In Gaza, only 25% of wastewater is treated due the lack of proper wastewater collection and treatment infrastructure, which is further complicated by the occupation that has restricted access to natural resources. This is alarming knowing that groundwater is central to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets adopted in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the region. It is directly linked to SDG6 and central to achieving many other SDGs such as SDG2 for ending hunger. It is also an important component of climate change adaptation, having a high buffer capacity against drought. Accordingly, the projected impacts of climate change on water resources in the region, will further increase dependency on groundwater at a time when groundwater recharge is also projected to decrease, necessitating conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater. The impacts of climate change on groundwater at the aquifer level is showcased by ESCWA on the Beni-Amir aquifer, Morocco and the Eocene aquifer, Palestine. Results from the study on Beni-Amir aquifer indicate that the water table is expected to decrease 10 to 25 m (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively) by end of century, resulting in partial depletion of resources in the top three layers of the aquifer system, particularly in the northern Beni-Amir area. In the case of Palestine, the results on the Eocene aquifer showed that in the 2041-2060 horizon, the average precipitation is expected to decrease in all scenarios between 3% and 12%, whereas the recharge in 5 out of 6 precipitation scenarios showed a reduction by 12%-16%. Consequently, with no decrease in the aquifer pumping, the water levels in all scenarios will drop. The declining availability of groundwater resources due to increased consumption, develop-ment demands, inefficient use and climate change should prompt Arab States to explore innova-tive and integrated governance frameworks to improve groundwater resources management and ensure equitable access for current and future generations to this strategic resource. Groundwater governance has been historically weak in the Arab region, characterized by fragmented legislations and policies, limited funding, lack of coordination and lack of data and knowledge. More recent evaluation of the management of groundwater resources through the SDG indicator 6.5.1 report-ing mechanisms on the degree of implementation of IWRM has unfortunately reinforced some of the main challenges listed above in the Arab region mainly in terms of lack of implementation of management tools and proper financing. In response to the lack or fragmentation of groundwater management policies, ESCWA developed regional groundwater abstraction management guidelines offering a unified approach to deal with uncontrolled groundwater exploitation and use. Groundwater governance is further complicated by transboundary aquifers. In fact, all coun-tries, except for Comoros, share at least one aquifer with their neighboring countries. These trans-boundary aquifers cover almost 58% of the Arab region's total area. Some of these aquifers are directly connected to surface-water hydrological systems and should also be conjunctively man-aged. Other transboundary aquifers contain fossil groundwater reserves requiring specialized legal, policy and management frameworks that consider their non-renewable character. The status of regional transboundary water cooperation is captured in a recent regional report prepared by ESCWA on the progress on SDG indicator 6.5.2 in the Arab region for the year 2021. The report revealed the challenges faced by the Arab states that hinder the establishment of well-developed cooper-ation frameworks which are mainly linked to lack of knowledge and data exchange and financial constraints. However, there are encouraging signs where cooperation on transboundary aquifers has progressed, including a Joint Authority for the Nubian sandstone Aquifer, a cooperation framework for the Senegalo-Mauritanian Aquifer, a signed agreement for the Saq-Ram Aquifer, and a consulta-tion mechanism on the North Western Sahar Aquifer System. These cooperation agreements should be maintained and further developed by holding regular meetings, coordinating objectives and management plans, and regularly exchanging data and information. Regional knowledge exchange around these agreements should be enforced. Advances in technologies provide an opportunity to fill the data and information gap that hin-ders the management of groundwater. Integrated remote sensing data offer a solution to assess the groundwater status. In addition, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is one of the most important solutions to consider for securing water supply and for improving groundwater quality where it is deteriorating. MAR is already used in more than 44 sites across the Arab region. Technologies can assist in selection of where MAR can be a potential solution for the region and for improving the water security.

This has given rise to a host of issues regarding fuel replenishment operations, safe operation management, maritime regulation, and coordinated governance of air and climate. In response to ocean acidification and climate change, regulations on the use of low-sulfur oil or alternative fuels by ships greatly reduce sulfur oxide emissions, but have no significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the refining process for low-sulfur fuels and the use of the gas cleaning system on ships both increase energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. To ensure the decarbonization process of shipping industry, there is an urgent need for a conceptual change in global ocean governance so as to promote the coordinated governance of air pollution and climate change. China's conception of ""a maritime community with a shared future"" provides a new model for global ocean governance. The Chinese government has formulated regulations at different levels to promote the coordinated management of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding supervision of sulfur oxide emissions from ships, this study proposes to build a multi-department collaborative supervision mechanism from marine fuel life cycle to enhance sulfur oxide monitoring and risk control capabilities.

Averting such crises will be especially daunting, given that they are just as much a failure of water management as they are a result of scarcity. A major shortcoming is the persistent underpricing of water. The increasing environmental and social costs associated with freshwater scarcity are not routinely reflected in markets. Nor have we developed adequate policies and institutions to handle these costs. This creates perverse incentives that fail to balance water exttraction with supply, protect freshwater ecosystems and generate water-saving innovations. However, drought is proving to be a catalyst for governance and policy reform, and steps can be taken to overcome the underpricing of water. Several examples are explored to illustrate the economic challenge. They include removing the barriers to water markets and trading, reallocating subsidies for water supply and sanitation to expand delivery in developing countries and reforming environmentally harmful irrigation and agricultural policies.

Correspondingly, climate-smart crops are also the need to regulate biomass production, which is imperative for the maintenance of ecosystem services worldwide. Since conventional breeding technologies for crop improvement are limited, time-consuming, and involve laborious selection processes to foster new and improved crop varieties.

Materials and methods The review is a collection of authorized information from various sources such as journals, books, book chapters, technical bulletins, conference papers, and verified online contents. Conclusions Speed breeding has emerged as an essential strategy for accelerating the breeding cycles of crop plants by growing them under artificial light and temperature conditions. Furthermore, speed breeding can also integrate marker-assisted selection and cutting-edged gene-editing tools for early selection and manipulation of essential crops with superior agronomic traits. Scientists have recently applied next-generation AI to delve deeper into the complex biological and molecular mechanisms that govern plant functions under environmental cues.

First, in response to the threat of climate change, policy at all levels of governance is increasingly promoting and incentivizing the deployment of zero carbon solutions, especially variable renewable energy (VRE) sources such as utility-scale wind and solar PV, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar PV and battery energy storage systems. Second, the costs of these technologies have declined to result in major increases in their market penetration. Finally, in response to greater access to cheaper, clean technology solutions, customers have become more engaged and proactive in their energy choices, both as a way to lower energy costs and to be more environmentally responsible. These de-carbonization dynamics are impacting electricity markets-those where competition has been introduced (restructured markets), as well as those where vertically integrated utilities maintain a monopoly (regulated markets). For example, increasing penetration of VRE has influenced wholesale market prices, and many of the organized wholesale markets have implemented initiatives to add greater flexibility in their market operations to accommodate larger amounts of VRE. In regulated markets, policy makers and regulators in many states are assessing a variety of changes in the existing regulatory framework to adapt to more DERs. This overview identifies the impacts of more VREs and DERs on each market structure, and describes key adaptations and changes in each market to accommodate these de-carbonization trends.

The literature on the subject is diverse but predominantly normative in character. As the notion of transformation becomes increasingly institutionalized in both climate science and climate policy, it becomes important to consider how the concept translates into governance. Hence, this study applies a critical perspective on transformational change in relation to vulnerability and adaptation in the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The analysis shows that the view on vulnerability in the GCF is mainly shaped by dominant logics such as science and the market that exclude the normative and political aspects of vulnerability.

Respondents understood climate change based on their own local experiences of climate change and EWEs. A main finding is that people in all three areas are driven to borrow money in the face of these events as a survival strategy and to be able to continue to support their families.

A strict adaptation plan, usually made for reducing the impact of climate change, may not be the solution, as different heritage site locations, materials, and hazard types need tailored plans. Therefore, in this research paper, a resilience approach was introduced to help adapt the most problematic sites to the impacts of climate change, i.e., coastal heritage sites. To fulfill the objective of achieving adaptation in a resilient way that can easily be developed in relation to different types of sites, mixed research methods were used. First, the literature was reviewed using the Connected Papers tool. Then, machine learning methods were used to process and analyze the input data of the resilience adaptation plan for an Egyptian coastal heritage site case study, i.e., Alexandria. Next, the data were arranged and analyzed, highlighting the main classifying algorithms responsible for identifying the resilience range, using the machine learning software packages Infra Nodus and WEKA, according to the differences in the climate change impact at the heritage sites.

Under Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, FERC has the authority and obligation to ensure that rates, charges, and rules relating to interstate natural gas sales and transportation are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory. Under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, FERC also has the authority to grant certificates for construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines that are needed for the ""present or future public convenience and necessity."" FERC's longstanding practice under its 1999 ""Policy Statement on Certification of New Natural Gas Facilities"" for pipelines is to assess whether there is a ""market need"" for the proposed pipeline project before addressing other considerations such as adverse impacts on existing pipeline company customers, other pipelines in the market and their customers, and landowners and communities. Changes in the availability and price of U.S. energy resources, growing concerns over increased climate impacts of building new natural gas pipeline infrastructure, and a series of adverse court decisions for FERC on its assessment of pipeline need and environmental impacts prompted FERC to reconsider and ultimately revise its 1999 pipeline policyfor thefirst time in over twenty years in February 2022. While this policy change has the potential to expand FERC's ability to address concerns associated with new pipeline infrastructure from the courts and the public, the policy was subject to strong dissents from two FERC commissioners and vocal opposition from industry and members of Congress, prompting FERC to reconsider its new policy. This means that any real reforms will be likely be contested and dcult in both the short term and the long term. As FERC considers new pipeline projects in the wake of this policy transition, this Article urges FERC to give real weight to the growing number of state and federal policies focusing on climate change and mandating a clean energy transition. This is in part because such policies directly impact whether new fossil fuel pipelines can establish the project need required to obtain a certificate under the Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. FERC's longstanding failure to consider climate impacts and the state ofthe nation's energy transition as an integral part of its project need analysis under Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act is a failure to fulfill its statutory obligation to both ratepayers and landowners, burdening them with stranded costs associated with expensive and potentially soon-to-be-obsolete fossil fuel infrastructure. Moreover, FERC's failure to adequately address project need for pipelines implicates not only Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, but arguably also violates Sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act, which require FERC to ensure that rates, charges, practices, and rules governing natural gas sales and transportation are ""just and reasonable.""",2022.0,YALE JOURNAL ON REGULATION,Government & Law,Evaluating Project Need for Natural Gas Pipelines in an Age of Climate Change: A Spotlight on FERC and the Courts,Political science,Alexandra B.,Alexandra,1.0,1.0

In the process of rebuilding, places do not simply reset - they transform, often in ways that confound any reduction of disaster risk, instead making people and settings more vulnerable to future hazard events. Reducing disaster risk is regarded as a global priority, but policies intended to reduce disaster risk have been largely ineffective. This obduracy represents a grand challenge in disaster studies. Here, I propose that the correlated trends of runaway economic costs of disaster events, growing social inequity, environmental degradation, and resistance to policy intervention in disaster settings are hallmark indicators of a system trap - a dynamic in which self-reinforcing feedbacks drive a system toward an undesirable and seemingly inescapable state, with negative consequences that tend to amplify each other over time. I offer that these trends in disaster settings are the collective expression of an especially powerful and distinct kind of system trap, which here I term the ""disaster trap"" - a new theoretical concept to help explain and address runaway disaster risk. I suggest that disaster traps are likely strongest in tourism-dominated coastal settings with high exposure to tropical cyclones and colonial histories of racial capitalism, which I explore with an empirical illustration from Antigua & Barbuda. Formalising a linkage between gilded and safe-development traps matters because their effects likely compound each other nonlinearly, such that disaster risk only increases and disaster risk reduction becomes increasingly difficult to achieve. Addressing traps requires understanding them as dynamic systems, described as fundamentally and completely as possible - their components, mechanisms, drivers, and structure - in order to reveal when and where interventions might be most effective at reducing disaster risk.",2022.0,WILEY,Geography,"The disaster trap: Cyclones, tourism, colonial legacies, and the systemic feedbacks exacerbating disaster risk",Geography,Eli D.,Eli,0.25,0.0

This paper highlights gaps between theory and practice by analyzing the justice dimensions of dilemmas routinely faced by adaptation administrators, using the example of property acquisitions to ground the analysis. Justice theories struggle to assist decision-makers in: prioritizing distribution of resources; distributing programs that cause both harms and benefits; weighing uncertain harms and benefits; identifying participants and resolving conflicts in participatory processes; and redressing historic injustices. Proposals to improve adaptation justice that do not address one or more of the practical dilemmas faced by administrators are unlikely to advance the cause. Absent theoretical or policy guidance, decisions are often shaped by administrators' unconscious heuristics such as views on the role of government and the purpose of buyouts. Tailoring justice-relevant decisions to local contexts may provide greater benefits than a universal approach to justice, but a relative approach is most likely to be just when justice-relevant decisions are transparent and informed by theoretical and empirical work. Transparency is critical for accountability, evaluation, and policy learning. Justice decisions are often constrained by limited authority, resources, and institutional goals, so achieving greater justice in climate adaptation may require changes in the larger governance systems within which adaptation decisions are made. More nuanced evaluations of adaptation justice, more comparative analyses, enabled by greater transparency in practice, and more holistic approaches to adaptation governance are recommended moving forward.",2022.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,The administrator?s dilemma: Closing the gap between climate adaptation justice in theory and practice,Environmental studies & forestry,A.

For the empirical analysis, rural household survey data, which was matched with rainfall variability data and experimentally generated measures of risk preference, was used. The results show that increased rainfall variability prompts households to reduce the application of productivity-enhancing inputs, such as fertiliser, but bolsters the application of low-risk inputs such as manure. These results are robust to alternative specifications and support the theoretical predictions developed. The findings suggest the following policy implications for chemical fertiliser use among risk-averse smallholder farmers in areas characterized by rainfall variability. First, developing more weather-resilient crop varieties and irrigation could stimulate higher use of chemical fertiliser by producing more stable yields. Secondly, weather index insurance (WII) could incentivize higher chemical fertiliser use by reducing income risk and easing liquidity constraints. Thirdly, social protection such as cash transfer programmes could lead to a higher use of chemical fertiliser by serving as insurance against income risks (i.e., through providing regular and predictable financial resources).",2022.0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Agriculture,Rainfall variability and alternative technology adoption: evidence from Ethiopia,Agriculture,Dambala,Dambala,,

This paper fills this gap by conceptualising a WEF nexus case with the Networks of Action Situations approach combined with systems thinking. This approach allows a deep analysis of the root causes of coordination gaps, facilitates a joint understanding of the system dynamics to identify leverage points for shifting the WEF nexus towards sustainability, and to envision the impact of potential interventions on the network of action situations and their outcome. The value and the reciprocal benefits of the combined approach introduced are illustrated for a case in Switzerland, Europe. The results show a coordination gap between the different sectors and that not all sectors were considered equally.

This contradiction is primarily due to the widespread constructions of reservoirs and intensive anthropogenic activities in coastal regions. In addition, coasts are particularly vulnerable to hazards due to climate change, such as sea-level rise, as they are located at the transition zone of terrestrial and marine environments. Along with the fact that Taiwan is an island and is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions globally, coastal management and sustainability are nationally critical topics, especially considering the ongoing reformation and legislation of Taiwan's coastal conservation laws. As stated in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goal 14, accurate and continuous shoreline positions information is essential for coastal conservation. However, by reviewing previous global studies and projects commissioned by the Taiwanese government aiming at monitoring shoreline changes, they usually exhibit several limitations, such as limited band selections or conservative band ratio-derived water indices, relying on either manual digitization or simple thresholding methods, focusing on either artificial or smoothly shaped coasts, and using images acquired at considerably different tidal height levels.

To ensure the coherence of adaptation policies, cooperation is necessary between sectors as well as between administrative levels. As such, fragmentation between both sectors and levels is a huge challenge for the successful formulation and implementation of climate change adaptation policies. Bridging actors who coordinate actions across levels and sectors play an important role in overcoming this challenge. Through means of social network analysis, I investigate which actors occupy key bridging roles in the multi-level and federalist arrangement of Swiss climate change adaptation governance. I analyse a two-mode network of actors and climate change adaptation measures, conducting a complete inventory of all measures and policies carried out in the context of the Swiss adaptation strategy as well as all actors involved in their design, funding and implementation. I find that federal governmental actors occupy the most important bridging roles. However, for the most part, they seem more focused on building cross-sectoral ties than on building cross-level ties. The Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) stands out as the one national authority that managed to establish almost as many cross-level ties as cross-sectoral ties through the coordination of an adaptation funding programme Thus, while adaptation measures will primarily be implemented on the municipal level, higher level actors still have a vital role to play in promoting municipal efforts, fostering collaboration and reducing fragmentation.",2022.0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Cross-scale collaboration for adaptation to climate change: a two-mode network analysis of bridging actors in Switzerland,Environmental studies & forestry,Dominik,Dominik,0.0,0.0

Global crises such as armed conflict, climate change, mass displacement, and public health emergencies are threatening the education and wellbeing of adolescents all over the world. But young people are also resilient and innovative. It is vital that they have opportunities to develop relevant skills and knowledge, to build resilience, and overcome these challenges now and in the future. Purpose This special issue brings together researchers and practitioners in the field of international education. Its purpose is twofold: to illustrate how current global challenges shape the types of skills needed to build resilience; and to offer possible solutions to supporting young people's development of such skills. Methods and approach The articles in this special issue draw on both quantitative and qualitative data, including surveys and interviews with students, parents, teachers, school leaders, nonformal education providers, and government officials. Most studies present evidence from sub-Saharan Africa. Findings The findings presented in this special issue address a range of skills, including foundational literacy and numeracy, hard skills in digital literacy, financial literacy, and entrepreneurship, and soft skills, such as critical thinking, confidence, voice and agency. Policy implications With the special issue we aim to draw more attention to the need for research and policy that equip youth with relevant skills and that see them not just as subjects of the challenges they encounter, but also as active agents of change.

A longer dry season increases production risks as animals may succumb to starvation, lack of water, or heat stress. I pair transaction data and weather shocks to show that ranchers strategically sold animals prior to the dry season, in response to two predictors of an extreme dry season: sporadic rainfall and high temperatures prior to the dry season. Ranchers sold animals for both fattening and slaughter in response to sporadic rainfall prior. Nearly half of animals initially sold for fattening were sold for slaughter 90 days later. In contrast, ranchers responded to high temperatures solely by selling for slaughter, suggesting that current on-farm technologies are insufficient to prevent losses from heat stress. The overall supply increased in years with sporadic rainfall and high temperatures, but the supply fell by a greater amount the following year. My results suggest that farmers are currently not fully insulated from the effects of a severe dry season.

The author uses the qualitative content analysis (QCA) method (i.e. summative content analysis [SCA]) to identify critical points of the SPM. Design/methodology/approach To better understand the WGI report and its SPM, the author uses the thematic analysis, often called the QCA method. This study takes more steps and uses one of the main qualitative content analysis approaches (i.e. SCA). Therefore, QCA (SCA) can help the author count the occurrence of certain words using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software that quantifies the words in the data. This process helps the author to understand codes and patterns (e.g. the concept in the results section). Findings Interestingly, the AR6 says more about adaptation for policy makers in sections C (Climate information for risk assessment) and D (Mitigation of future climate change) than in sections A and D. Finally, this study concludes that the IPCC WGI SPM has addressed evidence on global climate change policymaking for SPMa, SPMd (mitigation-based strategies and mitigation policy [MP]) and SPMb, SPMc (adaptation policy and adaptation-based strategy). Research limitations/implications First, this study refers only to the contribution of WGI, a SPM. The findings of this study do not necessarily provide a full understanding of what the AR6 WGI SPM says about climate change. It points out that the QDA Miner software and Voyant tool do not include all variables and examples where mitigation and adaptation-based strategies are discussed. The guidance for coding is based on the approved version of IPCC AR6 WGI SPM. The final limitation is that the relatedness of key words (e.g. confidence, high and warming) is sometimes ambiguous; even experts may disagree on how the words are linked to form a concept. Thus, this method works at the keyword level. A more intelligent method would use more meaningful information than keywords.

Despite their increased capacity to cope with challenging environments, polyploid lineages are generally as prone to extinction, and sometimes more prone, than their diploid progenitors. Although several explanations have been proposed to explain the short- and long-term disadvantages of polyploidy on the survival probability of populations, the consequences of whole-genome doubling on the heritable variance remain poorly studied. Whole-genome doubling can have major effects not only on the genetics, but also on the ecology and life history of the populations. Modifications of other properties of populations can reverse the effects of polyploidization per se on heritable variance. In this synthesis, I summarize the empirical and theoretical knowledge about the multifarious consequences of genome doubling on the heritable variance of quantitative traits and on the evolutionary potential of polyploid populations compared to their diploid progenitors. I propose several ways to decipher the consequences of whole-genome doubling on survival probability and to study the further consequences of shifting the ecological niche and life-history traits of a population. I also highlight some practical considerations for comparing the heritable variance of a trait among different cytotypes.

The reasons for this failure are manifold and have been broadly discussed at political and empirical levels in the last decades. However, much can still be said from a philosophical perspective. Such an analysis is not limited to the evaluation of cap-and-trade systems' lack of efficiency and the consequences arising from it but goes deeper into the moral questions underlying cap-and-trade systems. This is how this paper attempts to contribute to and expand the debate on emissions trading at different levels. By examining a popular analogy between traditional and climate commons, I challenge some of the economic and normative assumptions at the core of cap-and-trade systems. I argue that these assumptions lead to misguided conclusions in responding to the causes of climate change. This will partly explain why, although emissions trading is intended to fulfil a duty to mitigate greenhouse gases, we should not pin all our hopes on it just yet. Key policy insights The problems associated with free access to the traditional and climate commons can be conceived of in an analogous way, but the solutions to address them cannot. These include market-based policies focusing on the distribution of property rights over the atmosphere's capacity to absorb GHGs. Like other common resources, the atmosphere's capacity to absorb GHGs is limited and subject to deterioration due to free access and competing consumption. Unlike other common resources, there is no ability to restrict, control or sanction non-cooperative behaviour that continues to pollute the atmosphere. This poses a major challenge to the effectiveness of cap-and-trade systems. Emissions trading systems can be attractive mechanisms for pursuing GHGs targets by minimizing the costs of pollution while limiting the impact of mitigation on the overall economy. Nevertheless, even efficient emissions trading systems fail to fully address the moral concerns that lie at the heart of our current climate crisis.",2022.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,A right to pollute versus a duty to mitigate: on the basis of emissions trading and carbon markets,Environmental studies & forestry,Sarah Isabel,Sarah,1.0,1.0

Oaxaca is a global agrobiodiversity hotspot where cannabis and opium poppy have been widely cultivated for decades. The study is based on 76 structured/semi-structured interviews with imprisoned farmers, harvest gatherers, and former soldiers in four state prisons. Results show that illegal-drug crops and native-food crops complement each other until a threshold of violence is crossed, which leads to the abandonment of agriculture due to murder, imprisonment, and out-migration. The specialization of smallholder agriculture in illegal-drug crops tends to favor crossing the threshold of violence. In most municipalities in this study, however, rather a diversification process took place in which illegal-drug crops were incorporated to food production systems, reducing both the exposure and the sensitivity of smallholders to structural and direct violence. Other adaptation strategies involved local organization and militarization of smallholders for collective-risk management and territorial control. Ultimately, by comparing five vulnerability scenarios, this paper argues that the combination of peasant organization, militarization, and crop/livelihood diversification in Oaxaca mitigates the violent agrarian change associated with this illegal economy, while conserving agrobiodiversity.",2022.0,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,Geography,"Agrobiodiversity conservation with illegal-drug crops: An approach from the prisons in Oaxaca, Mexico*",Geography,Gabriel,Gabriel,0.0,0.0

This risk is not academic-other technologies, such as fission reactors, spent fuel waste repositories (e.g., Yucca Mountain), genetically modified foods, onshore and offshore wind turbines, electrical transmission lines, and even vaccines, struggle due to rejection by a substantial fraction of society, in other words, a lack of social acceptance. Conventional approaches to this challenge, such as risk-reducing technical solutions (e.g., replacing fission with fusion), or better ""communication"" or ""education,"" are unlikely, on their own, to be sufficient to mitigate this risk. Fortunately, fusion is sufficiently young that it has an opportunity to distinguish itself from other energy technologies not just in the way that it uses physics, but also in the way that it approaches society. In particular, fusion can anticipate, rather than react to, public concerns. Looking to other industries and fields of research, this paper describes the risk of a lack of public support and methods to achieve such support, including a social license, bio-ethical review, and responsible research and innovation. These methods are discussed in the context of seven case studies, illustrating practical application. The paper concludes with recommendations for specific steps that fusion companies, non-governmental organizations, academic researchers, government funders, and government regulators can take now to facilitate a longterm social license for fusion energy.",2022.0,AIP Publishing,Physics,Achieving a social license for fusion energy,Physics,Seth A.,Seth,0.0,0.0

In general, nothing can be done to prevent hot and humid weather episodes, but the animal-keeping farmer can take preventive measures in order to reduce the associated effects if heat stress situations occur (e.g. the presence of powerful fans in the combination with a sprinkler system in the barn, shady shelters (or trees) on the pasture, sufficient water supply, correct selection of the animal genetics used, etc.). Body temperature is probably the most reliable indicator of thermal stress as it 'drives' other mechanisms for thermal stress reduction. High temperatures stress high-performance cows in particular. Numerous studies show that Jersey cows are generally more heat-tolerant than high-performance Holstein cattle. Obviously, Jerseys' smaller body size - compared to thoroughbred Holsteins contributes to better thermal tolerance. However, in view of climate change, further studies seem urgently needed to confirm this observation under Central European conditions.

While TOD theory focuses on large cities and densely populated areas, it also tends to be applied in less populated areas. 'Station communities' are of great interest in Sweden, given the opportunities they apparently offer to combine economic growth through regional enlargement with decreased climate impact. This idea is, in many ways, inspired by the transit-oriented development (TOD) theory, and applied in the Vastra Gotaland region, aiming for regional development and increased public transportation use. The study has examined how the conditions for TOD are met in small towns with train stations located in sparse settlement structures through a case study and semi-structured interviews. The results indicate that train stations, together with planning approaches inspired by TOD theory, are regarded as important in municipal planning when identifying future developments, although the prerequisites for TOD are absent and the demand for new housing and businesses is weak. One conclusion is that a new concept is needed that does not focus on densification and urban qualities, but draws on the place qualities, where the connections to the train stations are enforced.",,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Transit-oriented development and sparse settlement structures.

Data from global or nested regional climate models (GCMs/RCMs) are frequently used to drive hydrological models, but now there are also very high-resolution convection-permitting models (CPMs). Here, data from the first CPM climate ensemble for the UK, along with the RCM ensemble within which the CPM is nested, are used to drive a grid-based hydrological model. The performance for simulating baseline (1981-2000) river flows is compared between the RCM and the CPM, and the projections of future changes in seasonal mean flows and peak flows are compared across Britain (1981-2000 to 2061-2080). The baseline performance assessment shows that (before bias correction) the CPM generally performs better than the RCM, and bias correction of precipitation makes both the RCM and CPM perform more similarly to use of observation-based driving data. The analysis of future changes in flows shows that the CPM almost always gives higher flow changes than the RCM. If reliable, these differences in flow projections suggest that adaptation planning for high flows based on use of regional data may be insufficient, although planning for low flows may be slightly over-cautious. However, the availability of CPM data only for one RCM/GCM is a limitation for use in adaptation as it under-samples the uncertainty range.

One potential pathway to revenue stability follows the agricultural ""insurance hypothesis"", which holds that crop diversification has stabilizing effects on productivity that mitigate risks from environmental stressors and market shocks, thereby producing a form of natural insurance against crop loss. While substantial support for the hypothesis exists, most studies testing the hypothesis have occurred at the farm or landscape levels and have controlled for a limited range of socioeconomic and environmental factors. This study tests the insurance hypothesis by examining the effects of crop species production diversity on revenue stability in low-income regions of southern Mexico. Here, rural farms experience chronic vulnerability to climatic shocks and market forces. Using parametric and non-parametric approaches, three groups of models are used to examine the effects of socio-environmental factors and farm structural and functional characteristics on the crop diversity-revenue stability relationship. Additionally factored in the relationship are the effects of cropping portfolios: statistical groupings of different crop species (n = 304) that characterize distinct farming areas (1340 municipalities). Findings support the insurance hypothesis and underscore the importance of crop diversification in the region. However, findings also show that irrigation plays an even stronger role than crop diversification in stabilizing farm revenues. Furthermore, some crop portfolios negatively impact revenue stability, including some portfolios with high crop diversity. In sum, a better understanding of farm contexts-contributing factors and cropping portfolios-is key to designing policies that help stabilize farm revenues through crop diversification.",2022.0,MDPI,Agriculture,Crop Species Production Diversity Enhances Revenue Stability in Low-Income Farm Regions of Mexico,Agriculture,Matthew C.,Matthew,0.0,0.0

Also, an assessment was made of how forest dependence and traditional knowledge are acknowledged in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).

The diversity of applied strategies found, mostly related to non-timber forest products (NTFPs), comprised ecologically sustainable and unsustainable practices. Mitigation strategies, mostly REDD+ projects, which were significantly associated with proactive and external initiatives, largely omitted information on the sensitivity of the studied Indigenous group and the involvement of traditional knowledge. Joint strategies seem to be a good compromise of participatory efforts and were largely linked to integrating Indigenous peoples' traditional knowledge.

The objective of the study was to assess the gender parity index in agriculture, resource governance patterns and how these impact the capacity to climate change adaptation. The results show wives were imparity with their husbands. The parity gap on ownership, access to, and decision-making power over agricultural equipment was as wide as 59% and this affects women's adaptation capacity to climate change impacts. Indeed, 94% of the coupled households have got their land by redistribution and inheritance land acquisition forms by which both forms of acquiring land favored the husband. Half of the respondent households acknowledged that they have already acquired certification for their farmlands.

It argues for a holistic framing of education's response, incorporating both climate and environment. While recognizing the imperative of global action, it emphasizes the need for national/local education systems approaches that reflect the distinct and localized challenges and responsibilities pertinent to high-income countries (HICs) and low- and lower-middle income counties (L&LMICs). Purpose After presenting an overview of climate-environmental issues and education the article offers a rudimentary framework categorizing education responses to anthropogenic environmental change (AEC). Methods and approach The article brings together findings from education, demography, disaster risk reduction (DRR), and environmental studies. Findings The key findings are: (1) that education provision in L&LMICs is already being affected by environmental change; (2) the causal links between education and positive environmental impacts are weakly evidenced; (3) the bulk of literature is preoccupied with global climate change and CO2 emissions to the detriment of localized environmental considerations; and (4) that education should be viewed more as a ""force multiplier""-alongside areas such as health, reproductive rights, social justice, and livelihoods. Policy implications The article argues that to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4.7-whereby education systems of all nations equip students for sustainable development-there is a need for a more geographically specific understanding of the drivers of both climate change and environmental degradation. Differentiated education reform responses are required which reflect both responsibility for carbon emissions and vulnerability to climate and environmental impacts. In HICs this would suggest a greater focus on mitigation (reduction of carbon emissions) and in L&LMICs on adaptation (responding to AEC).",2022.0,WILEY,Development Studies,"Education, anthropogenic environmental change, and sustainable development: A rudimentary framework and reflections on proposed causal pathways for positive change in low- and lower-middle income countries",Interdisciplinary,Colin,Colin,0.0,0.0

The tool is developed under six stages. Stage-1: A list of 28 indicators perti-nent to the present work are generated; Stage-2: The indicators are assorted into two main categories, namely, environmental and anthropogenic indicators; Stage-3: Indicator weights are suggested using expert elicitation procedure; Stage-4: Index formulation is performed consecutively; Stage-5: The pro-posed index is applied; Stage-6: An appropriate adaptation strategy is proposed to each specific country. The developed tool is applied to the Limpopo River basin using 28 indicators. Results show that both the environmentally and anthropogenically driven vulnerability of the four riparian countries are moderate ranging from 41.98% in Mozambique to 47.69% in South Africa. The value of indicators ranges from 0.93% to 98.81% in environmentally driven vulnerability and ranges from 0.00% to 97.66% in anthropogenically driven vulnerability. Climate change is thought to increase the vulnerability of water resources by 9.47% in Mozambique to 13.56% in South Africa.

Agroecosystem models are generally used to assess cropland carbon fluxes because of their ability to capture the complex interactive effects of factors influencing carbon balance. For regional carbon flux simulations, generally gridded climate data sets are used because they offer data for each grid cell of the region of interest. However, studies consistently report uncertainties in climate datasets, which affect the accuracy of carbon flux simulations. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to 1) determine the uncertainties in daily weather variables of commonly used high resolution gridded climate datasets in the U.S (NARR, NLDAS, Prism and Daymet); 2) estimate their impact on the accuracy of simulated Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) under irrigated and non-irrigated corn and soybeans using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, and 3) understand the relative sensitivity of the NEE to various climate variables. METHODS: The observational data at four flux tower cropland sites in the U.S Midwest region were used to quantify the uncertainties in the gridded weather datasets, and EPIC simulations were performed at each flux tower site using each gridded climate dataset. Further, sensitivity analysis using Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that daily weather variables in all gridded climate datasets display some degree of bias, leading to considerable uncertainty in simulated NEE. The gridded climate datasets produced based on interpolation techniques (i.e. Daymet and Prism) were shown to have less uncertainties, and resulted in NEE estimates with relatively higher accuracy, likely due to their higher spatial resolution and higher dependency on meteorological station observations. The Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) values of average growing season NEE estimates for Dayment, Prism, NLDAS and NARR include 22.53%, 23.45%, 62.52% and 66.18%, respectively. The NEE under irrigation (MAPE = 53.15%) tends to be more sensitive to uncertainties compared to the fluxes under non-irrigation (MAPE = 34.19%). Further, this study highlights that NEE responds differently to the individual climate variables and management. Under irrigation management, NEE are more sensitive to temperature. Conversely, under non-irrigation, precipitation is the most dominant factor influencing NEE uncertainty. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that careful consideration is necessary when selecting climate data to mitigate uncertainties in simulated NEE. Further, alternative approaches such as integration of remote sensing data products may help reduce the models' dependency on climate datasets and improve the accuracy in the simulated CO2 fluxes.",2022.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Agriculture,Climate data induced uncertainties in simulated carbon fluxes under corn and soybean systems,Agriculture,Varaprasad,Varaprasad,0.0,0.0
2084,"von Heiseler, Till Nikolaus","Humboldt Univ, Inst Philosophy, Dept Philosophy, Berlin, Germany.",1.0,"This paper contributes to two debates: the debate about language evolution and the debate about the foundations of human collaboration. While both cooperation and language may give the impression of being adaptations that evolved for the ""good of the group,"" it is well established that the evolution of complex traits cannot be a direct result of group selection. In this paper I suggest how this tension can be solved: both language and cooperation evolved in a unique two-level evolutionary system which was triggered by a well-documented geological event-the drying out of the climate-in East Africa, which subsequently reduced the intermating between groups and thus made it possible that the mechanism that produced differences between groups (including social forms of selection such as female choice) could be the target of natural selection on the group level. If a social form of selection (e.g., sexual selection) produced differences in fitness between groups, the displacement process between groups would indirectly select those forms of social selection that produce groups that would displace all others. The main hypothesis presented in this paper is that, in this situation, a backchannel between the two levels of selection naturally evolves. A backchannel between the two levels would, for example, emerge when sexual selection (or any other form of social selection) was sensitive to the individual's contribution to the group. Examples of systems utilizing a backchannel are nerve cells being better nourished when used more frequently, enabling them to be conducive to the survival of the whole organism, or a law firm in which all employees get paid to the extent that they contribute to the survival and success of the firm. In both cases, the selection on the higher level informs the selection on the lower level. The aim of the paper is to illuminate these rather opaque claims, to which the reader probably has many objections in this abridged form.",2022.0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,Psychology,How Language and Human Altruism Evolved Hand in Hand - The Backchannel Hypothesis,Psychology,Till Nikolaus,Till,0.0,0.0

Eight White Tasmanian social workers participated in a multimethod qualitative study informed by relationality and a dialogical framework. The research data were analysed using narrative analysis. Participants reported that Whiteness operated through workplace climate, culture and practices, and how physical spaces are constructed. Whilst the majority reported feeling discomfort about these contexts and practices, many had not spoken up or challenged Whiteness within organisations, affirming and perpetuating Whiteness. This research highlights the importance of social workers becoming actively involved in decision-making that explores alternatives to dominant approaches to refugee resettlement. Given the research suggests that knowing about Whiteness does not guarantee action, social workers also need to explore strategies for ensuring that they speak up to challenge Whiteness. However, service delivery models which are refugee-led and/or refugee-staffed organisations, or who utilise accountability practices are alternatives requiring more attention. This article presents findings from a research project exploring social work practices with people of refugee background with a focus on Whiteness. The findings of this research suggest that White Western ways of knowing, being and doing are dominant within organisations, limiting worker capacity to be responsive to the needs of clients of refugee background. Social workers need to speak up about Whiteness and work to make change within the organisations they work. However, programs and service delivery models which are refugee-led and/or staffed, or who utilise accountability practices may be the best way to guarantee culturally appropriate services. The findings of this research are particularly relevant to social workers, resettlement workers and critical Whiteness scholars.

In the wake of the global refugee crisis spurred by conflict, religious and political persecution, human rights violations, and climate disasters, a mental health has crisis followed. Not only does trauma experienced in home countries and as part of forced migration affect mental health, so too do post-migration traumatic events, discrimination, lack of access to quality and affordable healthcare and housing, and acculturation. To address mental health concerns in refugees and displaced populations, collective action is needed not only from health care providers but also from mental health researchers, funders, journals, resettlement agencies, government entities, and humanitarian organizations. The present review highlights the work of numerous scholars and organizations with the goal of understanding the mental health concerns of forcibly displaced persons within and across ecological systems. The present review seeks to bring attention to the experiences of forcibly displaced persons, summarize the growing body of research understanding the acute and chronic effects of forced displacement and possible interventions, and give a call to action for all members of the global community at every level to engage in joint efforts to improve mental health in refugees and displaced persons. Notably, there is a need for more interventions at the familial and community level that serve not only as treatment but also as prevention. Smartphone-based interventions, mind-body modalities, and interventions delivered by lay and non-clinician community members hold promise.

In rich nations, such crops would reduce production costs and environmental pollution and, in developing nations, they would improve food security and economic development. Crops with deeper roots would have better climate resilience while also sequestering atmospheric CO2. Deeper rooting, which improves water and N capture, is facilitated by steeper root growth angles, fewer axial roots, reduced lateral branching, and anatomical phenotypes that reduce the metabolic cost of root tissue. Mechanical impedance, hypoxia, and Al toxicity are constraints to subsoil exploration. To improve topsoil foraging for P, K, and other shallow resources, shallower root growth angles, more axial roots, and greater lateral branching are beneficial, as are metabolically cheap roots. In high-input systems, parsimonious root phenotypes that focus on water capture may be advantageous. The growing prevalence of Conservation Agriculture is shifting the mechanical impedance characteristics of cultivated soils in ways that may favor plastic root phenotypes capable of exploiting low resistance pathways to the subsoil. Root ideotypes for many low-input systems would not be optimized for any one function, but would be resilient against an array of biotic and abiotic challenges. Root hairs, reduced metabolic cost, and developmental regulation of plasticity may be useful in all environments.

I combine this thesis with an interrogation of urban metabolism and the governance of urban life and spaces to show the recursive relations between resilience fixes and transformative resilience strategies. Focusing on a ten-year postdisaster development in Metro Manila, this study shows how resilience fixes act within and through political economy systems, land use planning, technology adoption, and risk management regimes to decenter those who experience the double violence of capitalist urbanization and disaster capitalism while naturalizing utopian development, citizen surveillance, and a class-based retreat from the city.

The disastrous snowfalls that affected Asturias in Northern Spain in the winter of 1888 provide an intriguing and useful historical example of why such consideration is vital. This article is based on analysis of church records and population censuses of 22 mountain parishes over a 21-year period. It examines the long-term sociodemographic impacts of that weather event and reveals dramatic changes in fertility, mortality, and nuptiality. Marriages and births decreased by 67% in the 2 years following the snowstorms, when the highest levels of mortality were reached. The excess mortality especially affected those adults over 70, infants under 5, and, most notably, women. A livelihood crisis was at the base of these long-term effects. Those demographic impacts point to the event's severity and show that the repercussions of a disaster go far beyond deaths and material losses and are deeply rooted in social factors. These findings reinforce the idea that reconstructing old disastrous episodes is of great social and scientific interest now.

Other effects of these worldwide hardships include poverty, malnutrition and starvation, also bringing with them other forms of trauma, including emotional harm, neglect and deliberate maltreatment. Objective: To review the neurobiology of the systems in the developing brain that are most affected by physical and emotional trauma and neglect. Method: The review begins with those that mature first, such as the somatosensory system, progressing to structures that have a more protracted development, including those involved in cognition and emotional regulation. Explored next are developing stress response systems, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and its central regulator, corticotropin-releasing hormone. Also examined are reward and anti-reward systems and genetic versus environmental influences. The behavioural consequences of interpersonal childhood trauma, focusing on self-harm and suicide, are also surveyed briefly. Finally, pointers to effective treatment are proffered. Results: The low-threshold nature of circuitry in the developing brain and lack of inhibitory connections therein result in heightened excitability, making the consequences of both physical and emotional trauma more intense. Sensitive and critical periods in the development of structures such as the amygdala render the nervous system more vulnerable to insults occurring at those points, increasing the likelihood of psychiatric disorders, culminating in self-harm and even suicide. Conclusion: In view of the greater excitability of the developing nervous system, and its vulnerability to physical and psychological injuries, the review ends with an exhortation to consider the long-term consequences of childhood trauma, often underestimated or missed altogether when faced with adults suffering mental health problems.",2022.0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,Psychology,"The neurobiology of childhood trauma, from early physical pain onwards: as relevant as ever in today's fractured world",Psychology,Katharine Ann,Katharine,1.0,1.0

The Andean paramo is the largest and most diverse tropicalpine biogeographical region in the world, and also one of the most threatened as it is prone to accelerated environmental changes. My goal was to predict changes in the distribution ranges of the diverse and highly endemic paramo flora on the mid-term (50 years). First, I predicted distribution changes in paramo plant species under novel climates and considering dispersal constraints. Second, I looked for consensus areas of species losses vs. gains in the paramo, expecting to identify a gradient of increasing relative richness with elevation over time. Last, I evaluated the behavior of plant species regarding their climatic refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) to establish if they likely remain or transcend them. Based on VegParamo vegetation data and CHELSA bioclimatic information, I performed species distribution models for a 664 species pool, that were then contrasted between the present, future (2070) and past (LGM). About 8.3% of the entire species pool (55 species) were predicted to be extirpated from the paramo by 2070, including 22 species endemics. On average, paramo plants gained 15.52% of additional distribution by 2070 (18.81% for endemics). Models predicted the most area gains for the northern paramos of Colombia and Venezuela, and the highest losses for the eastern Ecuadorian and Peruvian mountains. Moreover, area gains were more pronounced at high elevations, suggesting a future accelerated colonization process toward the northern Andean summits. Finally, only 21.41% of the species' 2070 distribution coincided with their LGM (19.75% for endemics), and the largest climatic refugia since the LGM were found in southern Ecuador and Peru.

At the same time, growth processes substantially influence tree performance under water stress by changing the root-absorbing surface, leaf-transpiring surface, amount of conducting xylem, etc. Drought-induced growth suppression is often higher in conifers than in broadleaf species. This review is devoted to the relations between the growth of coniferous plants and their performance under increasing climate aridization in the temperate and boreal zones of the Northern Hemisphere. For adult trees, available evidence suggests that increasing the frequency and severity of water deficit would be more detrimental to those plants that have higher growth in favorable conditions but decrease growth more prominently under water shortage, compared to trees whose growth is less sensitive to moisture availability. Not only the overall sensitivity of growth processes to water supply but also the asymmetry in response to lower-than-average and higher-than-average moisture conditions can be important for the performance of coniferous trees under upcoming adverse climate change. To fully understand the tree response under future climate change, the responses to both drier and wetter years need to be analyzed separately. In coniferous seedlings, more active growth is usually linked with better drought survival, although physiological reasons for such a link can be different. Growth stability under exacerbating summer water deficit in coniferous plants can be maintained by more active spring growth and/or by a bimodal growth pattern; each strategy has specific advantages and drawbacks.

The gaps that emerged include (a) the insufficient reuse of valuable fatality databases; (b) the absence of simple take-home messages for citizens, practitioners, schoolteachers, and policymakers, aiming to set educational campaigns and adaptation measures; and (c) the lack of joint research projects between researchers working on landslides and doctors treating victims to provide complete research results that would be able to actually reduce landslide mortality.",2022.0,MDPI,Science & Technology - Other Topics,Landslide Fatality Occurrence: A Systematic Review of Research Published between January 2010 and March 2022,Interdisciplinary,Olga,Olga,1.0,1.0
2107,"Booker, James F.","Siena Coll, Econ Dept, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",1.0,"Water availability to meet consumptive use demands over the next century in the Lower Basin of the Colorado River in the southwestern United States is considered under alternative climate and policy scenarios. Modeling reservoir storage and annual releases under scenario alternatives demonstrates that policy can only modestly mitigate losses from potential long run streamflow reductions. The major reservoirs Lake Powell and Lake Mead are treated as composite storage, and Upper Basin depletions are held constant over 97 annual periods beginning with calendar year 2020. Averaged over six climate change scenarios with mean inflow reductions of 22% (reaching 45% by end of century) estimated mean releases fall by 16% to 23% from year 2020 levels depending on decision scenario. Mean releases under the existing Law of the River are 6.1% below the benchmark decision scenario which uses a perfect forecast of future flows. This is largely the result of evaporation losses because reservoir storage across climate scenarios is about double that of the benchmark. In contrast, a decision scenario based on next year and future mean flow expectations shows a release reduction of only 2.6% below the benchmark, and a 2.8% decrease in standard deviation. Across the three decision scenarios, future reservoir storage is well below capacity in almost all years, and under the three higher impact climate scenarios mean storage across the century is only 35% to 40% of capacity.",2022.0,WILEY,Engineering,Colorado River Water Use and Climate: Model and Application,Engineering & technology,James F.,James,0.0,0.0

The transformation of energy mixes is a time consuming and capital intensive task. Therefore, the aim of this article is to identify the directions of transformation of the energy mixes of selected European Union countries (those with an above average share of hard coal in meeting energy needs) conducive to reducing carbon dioxide and making the adaptation to EU climate requirements possible. Multidimensional analysis of the emissivity and composition of energy mixes used in the research allowed to distinguish 4 transformation paths. The most effective of them - in the context of achieving environmental goals - proved to be a quick and consistent abolition of coal and its replacement with renewable and nuclear energy and hydroelectricity. The lack or low level of reduction of the share of coal in the mix brought highly unsatisfactory effects in terms of emission reduction (Poland, Bulgaria, Turkey). The conclusions fill the research gap in the area of: (1) long term analysis of the relationships between decisions concerning shaping the energy mix and their climate effects, and (2) identification of effective pathways for reducing carbon dioxide in economies where hard coal was the key raw material.",2022.0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,Towards the reduction of CO2 emissions.
