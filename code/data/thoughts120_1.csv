"1","Increasing the Adaptation Pathways Capacity of Land Use Planning - Insights from New South Wales, Australia Australian local governments are expected to be the frontline of climate change adaptation implementation, but existing institutional arrangements are inadequate. Institutional changes that make adaptation pathways part of land use planning policy are needed and how this might happen is assessed using New South Wales (NSW), Australia, as a case study. The most effective implementation mechanism is identified as an independent adaptation statute integrated with land use planning. The institutional assessment approach employed is potentially useful for identifying adaptation policy implications in planning systems and is of relevance to ogoing research into local level adaptation. & x6458;(sic) (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)& x6c14;(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)& x7ebf;?(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic).

To test the extent to which the related concepts of sustainability, conservation, response to climate change, poverty alleviation, and gender equity have been incorporated into organizational culture, we compared mission statements published from 1990 to 2000 with those published in 2014 for 150 organzations, including conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), aid NGOs, government development agencies, resource extraction companies, and retailers (30 in each category). We also analyzed the 2014 home web pages of each organization. Relative to the earlier period, the frequency with which mission statements mentioned poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and a range of sustainable practices increased only slightly by 2014, particularly among resource extractors and retail companies. Few organizations in any sector had embedded either climate change or gender equity into their mission statements. In addition, the proportional intensity with which any of the aspirations were expressed did not change between periods. For current home pages, conservation NGOs, resource extractors, and government agencies were significantly more likely to acknowledge the importance of matters that were not part of their core business, but few aid agencies or retail companies promoted goals beyond alleviation of crises and profit maximization, respectively. Overall, there has been some progress in recognizing poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable practices, but gender equity and a determination to reduce impacts on climate change are still rarely promoted as central institutional concerns. Sustainability in general, and biodiversity conservation in particular, will not be achieved unless their importance is more widely apparent in core communication products of organizations. La Representacion de los Principios de Sustentabilidad en los Pronunciamientos de Mision y en las Paginas de Inicio de las Organizaciones mas Grandes del Mundo La conservacion se puede lograr solamente si la sustentabilidad es acogida como nuclear para las culturas organizativas. Para evaluar la extension a la que los conceptos relacionados de sustentabilidad, conservacion, respuesta al cambio climatico, reduccion de la pobreza y equidad de genero han sido incorporados a la cultura organizativa, comparamos los pronunciamientos de mision de 150 organizaciones publicados desde 1990 a 2000 con aquellos publicados en 2014, incluidas organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONGs) de conservacion, ONGs de ayuda, agencias gubernamentales de desarrollo, companias de extraccion de recursos y minoristas (30 en cada categoria). Tambien analizamos las paginas de inicio de cada organizacion en 2014. En relacion al primer periodo, la frecuencia con la que los pronunciamientos de mision mencionaron la reduccion de la pobreza, la conservacion de la biodiversidad y una gama de practicas sustentables apenas incremento para el 2014, particularmente entre los extractores de recursos y las companias minoristas. Pocas organizaciones de cualquier sector incluyeron al cambio climatico o a la equidad de genero en sus pronunciamientos de mision. Algo mas que no cambio entre periodos fue la intensidad con la que cualquiera de las aspiraciones fue expresada. En las paginas de inicio actuales, las ONGs de conservacion, los extractores de recursos y las agencias gubernamentales tuvieron una mayor probabilidad significativa de reconocer la importancia de asuntos que no son parte de su incumbencia principal, pero pocas agencias de ayuda o companias minoristas promovieron objetivos mas alla de la reduccion de crisis y maximizacion del beneficio, respectivamente. En general, ha habido cierto progreso en el reconocimiento de la reduccion de la pobreza, la conservacion de la biodiversidad y las practicas sustentables, pero la equidad de genero y una determinacion para reducir los impactos sobre el cambio climatico todavia no son promovidos como preocupaciones centrales de las instituciones. La sustentabilidad en general y la conservacion de la biodiversidad en particular, no se lograran a menos que su importancia sea mucho mas aparente en los productos nucleares de comunicacion de las organizaciones.

However, the natural role of fire has been disrupted in many regions due to the influence of human activities, which have the potential to either exclude or promote fire, resulting in a ""fire deficit'' or ""fire surplus'', respectively. In this study, we developed a model of expected area burned for the western US as a function of climate from 1984 to 2012. We then quantified departures from expected area burned to identify geographic regions with fire deficit or surplus. We developed our model of area burned as a function of several climatic variables from reference areas with low human influence; the relationship between climate and fire is strong in these areas. We then quantified the degree of fire deficit or surplus for all areas of the western US as the difference between expected (as predicted with the model) and observed area burned from 1984 to 2012. Results indicate that many forested areas in the western US experienced a fire deficit from 1984 to 2012, likely due to fire exclusion by human activities. We also found that large expanses of non-forested regions experienced a fire surplus, presumably due to introduced annual grasses and the prevalence of anthropogenic ignitions. The heterogeneity in patterns of fire deficit and surplus among ecoregions emphasizes fundamentally different ecosystem sensitivities to human influences and suggests that large-scale adaptation and mitigation strategies will be necessary in order to restore and maintain resilient, healthy, and naturally functioning ecosystems. climate; fire deficit; fire departure; fire exclusion; fire occurrence; fire suppression; fire surplus; invasive species; protected areas; wilderness; wildland fire;PONDEROSA PINE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST STRUCTURE; SIERRA-NEVADA; RED BROME; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; VEGETATION HISTORY; SOUTHERN CASCADES; RESTORING FIRE; GREAT-BASIN","Local management actions can increase coral resilience to thermally-induced bleaching Recent large-scale analyses suggest that local management actions may not protect coral reefs from climate change, yet most local threat-reduction strategies have not been tested experimentally. We show that removing coral predators is a common local action used by managers across the world, and that removing the corallivorous snail Coralliophila abbreviata from Caribbean brain corals (Pseudodiploria and Diploria species) before a major warming event increased coral resilience by reducing bleaching severity (resistance) and post-bleaching tissue mortality (recovery). Our results highlight the need for increased evaluation and identification of local interventions that improve coral reef resilience. nan;CORALLIOPHILA-ABBREVIATA; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; ACROPORA-PALMATA; GLOBAL CHANGE; FLORIDA-KEYS; REEFS; MORTALITY; ECOLOGY; DECLINE; IMPACT","Development of Resilience Index Based on Flooding Damage in Urban Areas Flooding volume in urban areas is not linearly proportional to flooding damage because, in some areas, no flooding damage occurs until the flooding depth reaches a certain point, whereas flooding damage occurs in other areas whenever flooding occurs. Flooding damage is different from flooding volume because each subarea has different components. A resilience index for urban drainage systems was developed based on flooding damage. In this study, the resilience index based on flooding damage in urban areas was applied to the Sintaein basin in Jeongup, Korea. The target watershed was divided into five subareas according to the status of land use in each subarea. The damage functions between flooding volume and flooding damage were calculated by multi-dimensional flood damage analysis. The extent of flooding damage per minute was determined from the results of flooding volume per minute using damage functions. The values of the resilience index based on flooding damages were distributed from 0.797292 to 0.933741. The resilience index based on flooding damage suggested in this study can reflect changes in urban areas and can be used for the evaluation of flood control plans such as the installation, replacement, and rehabilitation of drainage facilities. flooding damage; resilience index; multi-dimensional flood damage analysis;CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE; CITIES","The key drivers for the changes in global water scarcity: Water withdrawal versus water availability Water scarcity has become a major issue to sustainable development. It can be estimated by available fresh water resources and human water withdrawal, which are affected by both climate change and human activities. However, the key drivers for the changes in water scarcity at global scale remain unclear due to large uncertainties in the estimations of the contributions from changes in water withdrawal and water availability. By using a newly reconstructed water withdrawal dataset and multi-model simulations of water availability, this study assessed global water scarcity evolution during 1971-2010 at half degree resolution and monthly time scale by applying the water stress index (WSI). Results showed that WSI increased in areas with 61.1% of global population during 1971-2010, and the increase in water withdrawal (especially agricultural sector) was the key driving factor for areas with 57.5% of global population. Specifically, growing water withdrawal led to increased water scarcity for areas with 21% of global population in spite of rising water availability resulted from climate change, such as in southeastern China, Southeast Asia, southern India, and Central Africa. In contrast, water scarcity mitigated over some developed areas including parts of USA, Europe and Japan with 8.8% of global population, which resulted from decreased human water withdrawal (especially industrial sector) and increased water availability. This study reveals the synergistic or contrary effects of changes in water withdrawal and water availability on the changes in water scarcity over the globe, and provides useful information for regional water planning and management.

CAM plants feature a coordinated interaction between mesophyll and epidermis functions that involves refined regulations of gene expression. Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial post-transcription regulators of gene expression, however, their roles underlying the CAM pathway remain poorly investigated. Here, we present a study characterizing the expression of miRNAs in an obligate CAM species Kalanchoe marnieriana. Through sequencing of transcriptome and degradome in mesophyll and epidermal tissues under the drought treatments, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs that were potentially involved in the regulation of CAM. In total, we obtained 84 miRNA genes, and eight of them were determined to be Kalanchoe-specific miRNAs. It is widely accepted that CAM pathway is regulated by circadian clock. We showed that miR530 was substantially downregulated in epidermal peels under drought conditions; miR530 targeted two tandem zinc knuckle/PLU3 domain encoding genes (TZPs) that were potentially involved in light signaling and circadian clock pathways. Our work suggests that the miR530-TZPs module might play a role of regulating CAM-related gene expression in Kalanchoe. crassulacean acid metabolism; microRNA; photosynthesis; drought; circadian clock; Kalanchoe;CRASSULACEAN ACID METABOLISM; ARABIDOPSIS MICRORNAS; CAM PHOTOSYNTHESIS; C-3 PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CLOCK OPERATION; PLANT; CONSERVATION; INTEGRATION; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES","Decreasing energy consumption and carbon footprint in a school building: a comparative study on energy audits Energy audit of a school building was carried out to evaluate the effects of the building retrofitting on energy efficiency and carbon footprint. Lighting intensities of the selected areas in the building were measured and thermal images of the building envelope were compared before and after retrofitting. Combustion performance of the boilers was measured and the effects of the insulation on the natural gas consumption were investigated. According to the results, the lighting system renovation decreased the share of lighting in total electricity consumption of the buildings by 53.2% for the recommended lighting intensities in the selected zones. As a result of the lighting system renovation, carbon footprint of the campus decreased 308,715 kgCO(2) per year.

We constructed a system dynamics model for a cocoa agroforest landscape in southwestern Ghana to explore whether REDD payments are likely to promote forest conservation and what socio-economic implications would be. Scenarios were constructed for business as usual (cocoa production at the expense of forest), for payments for avoided deforestation of old-growth forest only and for payments for avoided deforestation of all forests, including degraded forest. The results indicate that in the short term, REDD is likely to be preferred by farmers when the policy focuses on payments that halt the destruction of old-growth forests only. However, there is the risk that REDD contracts may be abandoned in the short term. The likeliness of farmers to opt for REDD is much lower when also avoiding deforestation of degraded forest since this land is needed for the expansion of cocoa production. Given that it is mainly the wealthier households that control the remaining forest outside the reserves, REDD payments may increase community differentiation, with negative consequences for REDD policies.

In the context of the social determinants of health, focusing on health system preparedness is paramount for protecting the health of all of society. Faced with old threats (e.g., re-emergence of measles), disruptive new technologies (e.g., electronic cigarettes), increased challenges (e.g. drug-resistant organisms), and new threats (e.g., the current pandemic, climate change, politicized misinformation), our health systems must be robust and resilient. The response must include those who now suffer disproportionately-the poor and the vulnerable. Current World Health Organization priorities call for infrastructures capable of detecting, monitoring, and responding to health emergencies, such as COVID-19, and the health impacts of climate change in the context of health for all. Health care infrastructure can be better prepared and more equitable if systems are strengthened by building on core competencies and following the recommendations made for leadership, stakeholder involvement, accreditation, data collection, and funding resources. Ensuring health equity in a pandemic requires robust and resilient public health infrastructure during normal times.

This paper suggests an objective function combining two competitive shortage indicators for multi-objective reservoir operation optimization. An improved genetic algorithm including a smoothing constraint, reducing infeasible fluctuations of the operation policy, is developed to solve this problem. Operating curves were optimized jointly to hedging factors aiming at avoiding severe droughts and high damages for users. The proposed function was compared with the conventional objective function of minimizing the sum of squared deviations (SSD) between releases and demands. Different combinations of weights of the objectives linked to the Moroccan reservoir were studied. The proposed objective function yields to improved results in terms of computation requirements since it converges quicker and it leads to better supply performance. For drinking water use, the frequency of shortage was reduced by 66% and the maximum deficit by 14% whereas for irrigation the frequency of shortage was curtailed by 6%. The operating curves obtained by the developed optimization model were then compared with static operating rule curves simulated in RIBASIM. The superiority of variable optimized rule curves was proven compared with stable operating mode over time.

This paper seeks to contribute towards a better understanding of synergies and differences in how academics and local decision-makers think about resilience in the context of climate change. We compare definitions and characteristics of urban climate resilience in the academic literature with a survey of 134 local government representatives from across the U.S. Our analysis shows discrepancies in how academics and practitioners define and characterize urban climate resilience, most notably in their focus on either ""bouncing back"" or ""bouncing forward"" after a disturbance. Practitioners have diverse understandings of the concept, but tend to favor potentially problematic ""bouncing back"" or engineering-based definitions of resilience. While local government respondents confirm the importance of all 16 resilience characteristics we identified in the academic literature, coding practitioners' free response definitions reveals that they rarely mention qualities commonly associated with resilience in the scholarly literature such as diversity, flexibility, and redundancy. These inconsistencies need to be resolved to ensure both the usability of climate resilience research and the effectiveness of resilience policy. climate change; resilience; urban resilience; resilient city; climate resilience; adaptation;ADAPTATION; MITIGATION; POLICY; CITY; MANAGEMENT; ECOLOGY; SYSTEMS; CITIES; PLANS","An analysis of key issues in the Clean Development Mechanism based on the UNEP Risoe Clean Development Mechanism pipeline This paper provides a description of the analysis contained in the UNEP Risoe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) pipeline not available on the site, some of the impacts/problems of the CDM and a way forward post-2012. The successful development of the CDM since it started in December 2003 is documented. The CDM pipeline includes calculation of the investment in the CDM projects. The total investment in the 2171 registered CDM projects is approximately US$60 billion. It is shown that programmatic CDM gives hope for an increased share of projects in Africa, since 16% of the programmatic CDM projects are hosted by African countries compared with 2.5% for normal CDM projects. One aspect that is normally forgotten in the critique of CDM is that there are large indirect benefits of the CDM: a large increase in the awareness of the importance of making GHG reduction activities in the developing countries after the CDM capacity building activities have been performed compared with before the CDM started. nan;nan","Common fate of sister lakes in Hulunbuir Grassland: Long-term harmful algal bloom crisis from multi-source remote sensing insights With the increasing impact of drought and anthropogenic c activities, middle and high latitude lakes are increasingly facing exacerbated eutrophication. The sister lakes Hulun Lake and Buir Lake, the former located in the Hulunbuir Grassland in northeast China and the latter shared by China and Mongolia, have been exposed to outbreaks of harmful algal blooms (HABs) of varying degrees. In this study, multi-source remote sensing technologies were utilized to explore the essential factors causing HAB occurrences in the Hulun Basin. First, a simplified adjusted floating algae index (AFAI) algorithm was applied to invert the HAB sequence from 1984 to 2019. The results show that large-scale HABs were detected in both lakes on or close to the same days in 1984, 1999, and 2013. From a long-term perspective, the HAB events of Hulun Lake are more serious and intractable than those of Buir Lake in terms of outbreak frequency, duration, and scale. Furthermore, the effects of meteorological and hydrological conditions were evaluated quantitatively. In situ sampling of the two lakes highlights the limiting effect of nutrients on the algae flooding in Buir Lake with perennial outflow. In contrast, Hulun Lake turned into an internal flow lake without outlets from 2000 to 2012 and the decreasing water volume stimulated the accumulation of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), with averages of 2.36 and 0.21 mg/L, respectively. Analysis of the comprehensive driving factors demonstrates that the level of exogenous nutrients caused a difference in the severity of the HAB event between the sister lakes, which are largely determined by drought and eco-unfriendly anthropogenic activities. Our work emphasizes the pivotal role of substantial increases of nutrient loads and stricter regulations are necessary to curb further deterioration of this situation.

Design A time-series study. Setting We obtained time-series data of AECOPD hospitalisations, meteorological variables and air quality index in Beijing, China during 2012-2016. Participants All AECOPD hospitalisations among permanent residents in Beijing, China during the cold seasons (November-March) of 2012-2016 were included (n=84 571). Primary and secondary outcome measures A quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag model was fitted to investigate the short-term effects of cold spells on AECOPD hospitalisations by comparing the counts of AECOPD admissions during cold spell days with those during non-cold spell days. Results Cold spells under different definitions were associated with increased risk of AECOPD hospitalisations, with the maximum cumulative relative risk (CRR) over 3 weeks (lag0-21). The cumulative effects at lag0-21 increased with the intensities and the durations of cold spells. Under the optimal definition, the most significant single-day relative risk (RR) was found on the days of cold spells (lag0) with an RR of 1.042 (95% CI 1.013 to 1.072), and the CRR at lag0-21 was 1.394 (95% CI 1.193 to 1.630). The elderly (aged >= 65) were more vulnerable to the effects of cold spells on AECOPD hospitalisations. Conclusion Cold spells are associated with increased AECOPD hospitalisations in Beijing, with the cumulative effects increased with intensities and durations. The elderly are at particular risk of AECOPD hospitalisations triggered by cold spells. epidemiology; public health; chronic airways disease;SUBTROPICAL CITIES; GUANGDONG PROVINCE; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; LUNG-FUNCTION; HEAT WAVES; MORTALITY; TEMPERATURE; IMPACT; COPD; HYPERSECRETION","Life cycle analysis of concrete and asphalt used in road pavements The article examines the impact differences between producing concrete and asphalt. Both materials are widely used in the construction industry. Construction activities account for a large portion of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is important to consider the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) to reduce environmental impacts. In this study, the material processes were inputted into an LCA program called SimaPro. The database used for the study was Ecoinvent as it is one of the major databases within SimaPro. The materials were compared against impacts per kg of material produced as the functional unit. Each process was created using the materials, energy and transportation required to produce the materials. Waste streams were also included in the process to determine the impacts after the product was done with its useful life. Using the ReCiPe method, an LCA was conducted. Midpoint and endpoint categories were examined for both the productions. The processes had similar results for the human health and ecosystems categories; however asphalt was marginally higher for both. Asphalt had exceeded concrete in the resource impact category by 100 mPt. The results indicate that concrete is the more sustainable building material. Determination of various impacts of the materials is important for material selection.

In response, federal, state, and local governments have broadened their flood mitigation strategies to include acquisition and demolition of flood-damaged homes (""buyouts""). Little work has documented or analyzed the range of strategies for funding buyouts. Federal programs provide the bulk of funding, but these programs are often slow. Also, state and local governments struggle to meet cost-match requirements. We present and analyze a nationwide census of buyout funding programs (n = 34), which draw on five primary funding mechanisms. We find that state and local governments are using a range of traditional and innovative financial mechanisms, including municipal/green bonds, revolving loan funds, local option sales taxes, and stormwater utility fees, as viable tools for funding buyouts. These tools may promote more autonomy from federal government mitigation programs, and ultimately, faster buyout processes. floodplain buyouts; environmental finance; hazard mitigation; climate adaptation; floodplain management; municipal finance;nan","Artificial Snowmaking: Winter Sports Between State-Owned Company Policy and Tourist Demand Due to changing climatic conditions, artificial snowmaking has become a major method of ski resort adaptation globally. It is a financially intensive operation requiring high start-up investment and involving operating costs that are dependent on weather conditions. Operational costs and the expansion of artificial snowmaking systems increase the price of ski passes. In our work, we analyzed the operations of a public company that operates the largest ski resorts in Serbia and directs the flow of winter sports tourism. We tried to determine, by means of correlation, the extent to which ski pass prices in the biggest winter resort in Serbia are influenced by factors such as natural snow cover, number of tourist overnights, ski run length, and local wages. The results of the survey indicate an increasing transformation of the ski resort into a thematic attraction independent of climatic factors in terms of determining ski pass prices. artificial snowmaking; correlation; ski pass; price; public; policy; Kopaonik;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SNOW PRODUCTION; SKI INDUSTRY; WEATHER; FUTURE; ADAPTATION; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; ANALOG; AREA","Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index: Model improvement and application Monitoring of droughts is the first step into human adaptation and related management of drought hazards. Therefore, drought index is critical in drought monitoring practice. However, the standing drought indices include no information about agricultural irrigation. In this case, based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Self-Calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI), here we proposed the Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI) by considering agricultural irrigation such as irrigation quotas and soil water deficits. We compared changes of droughts monitored by MPDSI and other drought indices considered in this study, and found that MPDSI can well monitor drought conditions in irrigated regions. In this sense, MPDSI can monitor the actual drought conditions under human influences such as irrigation. Besides, we also found that MPDSI can well lessen overestimation of drought conditions by PDSI in terms of drought duration and drought intensity. Therefore, we can conclude that MPDSI can be accepted in drought monitoring practice across China. It should be noted here that the idea behind development of MPDSI and also the MDPSI proposed in this study can be well referenced in drought monitoring in other regions of the globe.

However, the potential role of urban regeneration in creating climate-friendly urban environments is not sufficiently evaluated and understood. Considering this gap, the paper aims to explore the potential linkage between urban regeneration and climate change. The case study analysis focuses on two urban regeneration projects, representing two major approaches of regeneration practices in Japanese cities, namely ""project-based"" and ""plan-based"" approaches. Research findings demonstrate that urban regeneration could help in reorganising existing urban areas in a climate-friendly manner. As a cross-cutting field of urban policy, urban regeneration could also help in creating synergies between mitigation and adaptation goals. Yet, achievement of such outcomes via regeneration projects necessitates the existence of an overriding urban development vision, political commitment, and willingness to implement binding and structural measures. urban regeneration; climate change; mitigation; adaptation; low carbon urbanism; compact city;nan","The increasing hunger concern and current need in the development of sustainable food security in the developing countries Background: COVID-19 has affected millions of people worldwide. Recently, international agencies have revealed that poverty and hunger could kill more people than COVID-19 victims. Many global workforces have lost their jobs during this pandemic situation. In developing countries, most of the workers and their families live hand to mouth, depending on daily wage, and loss of income would be a hunger pandemic. Globally, the proportion of undernourished and hungry people have been on an upswing due to climate changes and violent conflicts. The millions of people are facing chronic malnourishment and COVID-19 menaces undermining the endeavour of philanthropic and food security. COVID-19 has increased the risk of livelihood by the shortage of food and distraction of the supply chain especially in the developing countries where rural expanses depend on agriculture production and seasonal jobs. So, if they are forced to limit their activities, their livelihoods will be demolished. Scope and approach: COVID-19 is increasing the jeopardy of food prices over the world, which would prompt a crisis in several developing countries. The government organizations in developing countries are doing well to protect people from the current pandemic. But they are also in critical situation regarding food supply chains and are facing difficulties in providing nutrient-rich foods. The susceptible people are fraught to secure household income and manage their food. In this review, we have explored the food security approach, food supply chain and risk of food shortage. Every country in the world needs to implement effective interventions to maintain open trade and food supply chains, ensure access to nutrients for all at affordable prices and develop co-operation to preserve the flexibility of universal food markets.

We assessed genetic diversity in 8 reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep using 16 microsatellite markers and a 515-base-pair segment of the mitochondrial control region. Populations were categorized by their translocation histories: first-order populations were those established directly from large source populations, second-order populations were established using individuals from first-order populations, and populations with mixed translocation histories were those established or supplemented with sheep from more than 1 sample on a source population. Nuclear and mitochondrial datasets yielded complementary signals of declining genetic diversity (mixed>first order>second order) that differed predictably in magnitude. Our suite of microsatellites revealed that populations with mixed translocation histories had greater allelic richness (A(R)) and expected heterozygosity (H-E) than second-order populations, but we found no statistical differences between mixed:first order or first:second order population pairs. Mitochondrial diversity, however, was limited to populations with mixed translocation histories. Similarly, we detected significant differentiation (F-ST) among most populations using data from microsatellites, but found major differentiation in mitochondrial diversity. All first-order and second-order populations shared a single haplotype, whereas mixed populations contained 6 haplotypes. Finally, estimates of effective population size (N-e) derived from our microsatellite data were uniformly low (range 9-27), indicating that the maintenance of genetic diversity in the reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep in our study likely will require management action; possibly including future translocations and improvements in natural connectivity among populations. ","The effects of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emission taxes: An empirical study in China China has become the largest producer of carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions in the world. However, almost all current Chinese policies are emphasizing the control of CO2 emissions only, and no goals have been established for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions, China risks missing early opportunities for lower-cost abatement of the latter. Aiming to disclose the different effects of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions and provide some suggestions for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction in China, this paper focuses on identifying the price impacts and transmitting paths among different sectors of imposing CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission taxes using the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) model, then further compares the sources of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions based on the big data from the first national census of pollution sources. When the same emission tax is imposed for every ton of CO(2)e, the results clearly show that the prices in all sectors have the greatest increase for CO2 emissions tax scenario relative to CH4 and N2O emissions tax scenarios. With respect to sectors with larger CH4 and N2O emissions, price change in sectors with larger CO2 emissions will be responsible for the price change of almost all sectors. Moreover, from the perspective of sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions, CO2 emissions are from almost all industries of the entire economy, and CH4 and N2O emissions are from agriculture, energy mining, and waste. These results indicate that the tax reducing CH4 and N2O emissions will cause lower impacts than the abatement of CO2 emissions. Integrating the current national policies with the above results, Chinese government should also pay more attention to CH4 and N2O emission reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such an analysis also helps in targeting adaptation investments, specific to more vulnerable regions. Adopting the definition of vulnerability given by IPCC, vulnerability was assessed for 572 rural districts of India. Thirty eight indicators reflecting sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure were chosen to construct the composite vulnerability index. Climate projections of the PRECIS model for A1B scenario for the period 2021-2050 were considered to capture the future climate. The data on these indicators were normalized based on the nature of relationship. They were then combined into three indices for sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity, which were then averaged with weights given by experts, to obtain the relative vulnerability index. Based on the index, all the districts were divided into five categories with equal number of districts. One more district was added to 'very high' and 'high' categories. The analysis showed that districts with higher levels of vulnerability are located in the western and peninsular India. It is also observed that the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic Plains are relatively more sensitive, but less vulnerable because of higher adaptive capacity and lower exposure.

The seeds have an average of 23% protein and 80% of the crops's nitrogen requirements are met from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Chickpea has several desirable agronomic characteristics and it is one of the most heat and drought-resistant crop and suitable for production in low moisture and fertility soils. Chickpea remarkably predominates among other pulse crops in terms of both area and production in India. To meet with the ever increasing demand for new varieties with desirable traits, the genetic resources of chickpea are of immense value for the breeders. Due to rapid changes in the agro-ecological conditions throughout the world, the chickpea genetic resources comprising of wild species, old and primitive cultivars, land races endowed with superior gene complexes are being rapidly eroded. Efforts for augmentation of chickpea genetic resources were undertaken by importing the diverse germplasm from various parts of the world. The exotic introduction in chickpea comprises germplasm with resistance to various biotic and abiotic stresses and its wild species for utilisation in crop improvement programmes in India.

Thailand's coastlines is also likely to face erosion, especially in the low-lying areas, and its future projection due to sea level rise is necessary. This study compiled a database of beach characteristics, including grain size diameter, beach slope and beach width, to assess the projections of future beach loss along Thailand's coastlines against sea level rise scenarios of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in 2081-2100, relative to a reference period 1986-2005 by using the Bruun rule. Future national beach loss rates were projected to be 45.8% for RCP2.6, 55.0% for RCP4.5, 56.9% for RCP6.0 and 71.8% for RCP8.5. In addition, the rate against the sea level scenarios projected by each CMIP5 model for RCP4.5 ranges from 49.1% for MPI-ESM-LR to 73.4% for MIROC-ESM-CHEM. Based on the current beach situation, sandy beaches in 8 and 23 out of 51 zones will disappear for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively. These findings will help governors and stakeholders develop adaptation strategies against beach loss due to sea level rise.

Sea level rise (SLR) and decline of freshwater heads due to climate change are the two key variables that may affect saltwater intrusion. This study aims to give a better understanding of the impact of increasing seawater levels and decreasing freshwater heads due to climate change and increasing abstraction rates due to overpopulation using experimental and numerical models on SWI. The experimental model was conducted using a flow tank and the SEAWAT code was used for the numerical simulation. Different scenarios were examined to assess the effect of seawater rise and landside groundwater level decline. The experimental and numerical studies were conducted on three scenarios: increasing seawater head by 25%, 50% and 75% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, decreasing freshwater head by 75%, 50% and 25% from the difference between seawater and freshwater heads, and a combination of these two scenarios. Good agreement was attained between experimental and numerical results. The results showed that increasing the seawater level and decreasing freshwater head increased saltwater intrusion, but the combination of these two scenarios had a severe effect on saltwater intrusion. The numerical model was then applied to a real case study, the Biscayne aquifer, Florida, USA. The results indicated that the Biscayne aquifer is highly vulnerable to SWI under the possible consequences of climate change. A 25 cm seawater rise and 28% reduction in the freshwater flux would cause a loss of 0.833 million m(3) of freshwater storage per each kilometer width of the Biscayne aquifer. This study provides a better understanding and a quantitative assessment for the impacts of changing water levels' boundaries on intrusion of seawater in coastal aquifers. seawater intrusion; sea level rise; experimental model; numerical model; Biscayne aquifer;SEAWATER INTRUSION; RISE","Thermal dependency of burrowing in three species within the bivalve genus Laternula: a latitudinal comparison The upper thermal limits for burrowing and survival were compared with micro-habitat temperature for anomalodesmatan clams: Laternula elliptica (Antarctica, 67A degrees S); Laternula recta, (temperate Australia, 38A degrees S) and Laternula truncata (tropical Singapore, 1A degrees N). Lethal limits (LT50) were higher than burrowing limits (BT50) in L. elliptica (7.5-9.0 and 2.2A degrees C) and L. recta (winter, 32.8-36.8 and 31.1-32.8A degrees C) but the same range for L. truncata (33.0-35.0 and 33.4-34.9A degrees C). L. elliptica and L. truncata had a BT50 0.4 and 2.4-3.9A degrees C, respectively, above their maximum experienced temperature. L. recta, which experience solar heating during midday low tides, had a BT50 0.7-2.4A degrees C below and a range for LT50 that spanned their predicted environmental maximum (33.5A degrees C). L. recta showed no seasonal difference in LT50 or BT50.

As yam is an important food and nutrition security crop, it is of paramount importance to assess the effect of climate change on the physiological processes especially photosynthetic efficiency to identify the climate-smart varieties to meet the future food demand. The aim of this experiment was to assess the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2, transpiration and physiological water use efficiency of seven yam varieties subjected to 400 ppm (ambient), 600, 800 and 1000 ppm (elevated carbon dioxide concentration). All the parameters were found significant at P < 0.001. The mean photosynthetic rate increased significantly increased at 400-1000 ppm and no down-regulation was observed. Similar trend was observed in case of intercellular CO2 and physiological water use efficiency (WUEinstantaneous and WUEintrinsic). However, stomatal conductance increased significantly up to 800 and decreased at 1000 ppm. Contrasting results were recorded with regard to transpiration, which steadily decreased at ascending carbon dioxide concentrations. Further, photosynthesis rate had a significant (P < 0.001) positive linear correlation with the elevated carbon dioxide (R-2 = 0.783) and intercellular CO2 concentration (R-2=0.763). White yam and greater yam were found to be responsive to elevated carbon dioxide as photosynthetic rate at 1000 ppm increased up to-68% in comparison to 400 ppm.(C) 2022 SAAB.

The magnitude of the variability or fluctuations of the factors varies according to locations. Hence, examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, the present study examines long-term changes and short-term fluctuations in monsoonal rainfall and temperature over Kalahandi, Bolangir and Koraput (hereafter KBK) districts in the state of Odisha. Both rainfall and temperature data for period of 1980-2017 were analyzed in this study. Statistical trend analysis techniques namely Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were used to examine and analyze the problems. The detailed analysis of the data for 37 years indicate that the annual maximum temperature and annual minimum temperature have shown an increasing trend, whereas the monsoon's maximum and minimum temperatures have shown a decreasing trend. Statistically significant trends are detected for rainfall and also the result is statistically significant at 99% confidence limit during the period of 1980-2017. Rainfall is showing a quite good increasing trend (Sen's slope = 4.034) for JJAS season. In the case of maximum temperature for the observed period, it showed a slight warming or increasing trend (Sen's slope = 0.29) while the minimum temperature trend showed a cooling trend (Sen's slope = -0.006) but result of maximum temperature trend analysis is statistically significant at 95% confidence limit, on the contrary, the trend analysis result of minimum temperature is not statistically significant. climate variability; Mann-Kendall's test; Sen's slope estimator; trend analysis;TEMPORAL TRENDS; RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; CONNECTION; MINIMUM; MAXIMUM","Technology transfer for adaptation Technology alone will not be able to solve adaptation challenges, but it is likely to play an important role. As a result of the role of technology in adaptation and the importance of international collaboration for climate change, technology transfer for adaptation is a critical but understudied issue. Through an analysis of Global Environment Facility-managed adaptation projects, we find there is significantly more technology transfer occurring in adaptation projects than might be expected given the pessimistic rhetoric surrounding technology transfer for adaptation. Most projects focused on demonstration and early deployment/niche formation for existing technologies rather than earlier stages of innovation, which is understandable considering the pilot nature of the projects. Key challenges for the transfer process, including technology selection and appropriateness under climate change, markets and access to technology, and diffusion strategies are discussed in more detail. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES; ADOPTION; INNOVATION; POLICY; PERSPECTIVE; DIFFUSION; OPTIONS","What Role for ""Long-term Insurance"" in Adaptation? An Analysis of the Prospects for and Pricing of Multi-year Insurance Contracts Multi-year insurance has been proposed as a tool to incentivise policy-holders to invest in property-level adaptation. In a world of rising natural catastrophe risks, such autonomous adaptations could have significant benefits for the property owner, the insurer and society. We review some arguments made in respect of multi-year contracts and provide new analyses on their price implications. We conclude that even under conditions of known and stationary risk, initial capital requirements could be around 50 per cent higher for a 10-year contract than an annual contract and the annual premium around 5.5 per cent higher; in the real world of changing and uncertain risks, premiums would be even higher. We also conclude that multi-year contracts have several additional disadvantages that are likely to limit their demand and availability in the general retail insurance market. For adaptation, we conclude that other tools, such as risk-based premiums and loans for adaptation tied to the property, have greater potential.

Multistage sampling procedure was used to select 384 small-scale farmers. Percentage and regression were used in the analysis. Among the socio-economic factors, gender positively and significantly influenced adoption of conservation agriculture and water harvesting at 5%, respectively. Among the institutional factors, distance to markets positively or negatively influenced uptake of all the technologies at 1% and 5%, respectively. Due to complementarity in adoption of all the seven adaptation practices, age and distance to nearest markets should be considered during technology dissemination. The study, therefore, calls for agricultural policy reforms that aim at designing incentive programmes which adequately address most of the socioeconomic and institutional issues related to uptake of adaptation practices as well as encouraging off-farm diversification.

The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) aims to expand the coverage of well-connected PAs and other effective area-based conservation measures to 30% by 2030. We proposed a framework to evaluate the connectivity of PAs and developed strategies to maintain and improve the connectivity of PAs based on PA connectivity indicators, and we applied this framework to China's terrestrial PAs. We considered that the concept of PA connectivity is at the level of both PA patches and PA networks, including four aspects: intra-patch connectivity, inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA-landscape connectivity. We found that among China's 2153 terrestrial PA patches, only 427 had good intra-patch connectivity, and their total area accounted for 11.28% of China's land area. If inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA-landscape connectivity were taken as the criteria to evaluate PA connectivity, respectively, then the coverage of well-connected terrestrial PAs in China was only 4.07%, 8.30%, and 5.92%, respectively. Only seven PA patches have good connectivity of all four aspects, covering only 2.69% of China's land. The intra-patch, inter-patch, network, and PA-landscape connectivity of China's terrestrial PA network reached 93.41%, 35.40%, 58.43%, and 8.58%, respectively. These conclusions indicated that there is still a big gap between China's PA connectivity and the Post-2020 GBF target, which urgently needs to be improved. We identified PA patches and PA networks of ecological zones that need to improve PA connectivity and identified improvement priorities for them. We also identified priority areas for connectivity restoration in existing PAs, potential ecological corridors between PAs, and priority areas for PA expansion to improve the connectivity of PAs in China. Application of our framework elsewhere should help governments and policymakers reach ambitious biodiversity conservation goals at national and global scales. biodiversity conservation; connectivity; protected areas; dispersal probability; least-cost distance; ecological corridor;LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; HABITAT PATCHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NETWORK ANALYSIS; IMPACT; CORRIDORS; INDEXES; TARGETS","Physiological, Biochemical, and Molecular Mechanisms of Heat Stress Tolerance in Plants High temperature (HT) stress is a major environmental stress that limits plant growth, metabolism, and productivity worldwide. Plant growth and development involve numerous biochemical reactions that are sensitive to temperature. Plant responses to HT vary with the degree and duration of HT and the plant type. HT is now a major concern for crop production and approaches for sustaining high yields of crop plants under HT stress are important agricultural goals. Plants possess a number of adaptive, avoidance, or acclimation mechanisms to cope with HT situations. In addition, major tolerance mechanisms that employ ion transporters, proteins, osmoprotectants, antioxidants, and other factors involved in signaling cascades and transcriptional control are activated to offset stress-induced biochemical and physiological alterations. Plant survival under HT stress depends on the ability to perceive the HT stimulus, generate and transmit the signal, and initiate appropriate physiological and biochemical changes. HT-induced gene expression and metabolite synthesis also substantially improve tolerance. The physiological and biochemical responses to heat stress are active research areas, and the molecular approaches are being adopted for developing HT tolerance in plants. This article reviews the recent findings on responses, adaptation, and tolerance to HT at the cellular, organellar, and whole plant levels and describes various approaches being taken to enhance thermotolerance in plants. abiotic stress; antioxidant defense; climate change; high temperature; heat shock proteins; oxidative stress; plant omics; stress signaling;HIGH-TEMPERATURE STRESS; MODULATES ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSE; INDUCED OXIDATIVE STRESS; SHOCK-PROTEIN; DROUGHT-STRESS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; OVER-EXPRESSION; SALICYLIC-ACID; ABIOTIC STRESS; ABSCISIC-ACID","Context specific adaptation grammars for climate adaptation in urban areas In the context of climate adaptation planning there are relationships between adaptation drivers and adaptation measures, which makes the selection and implementation of the adaptation measures a challenging task. This challenge may be addressed by: structuring the adaptation problem using a multiple perspective adaptation framework; and applying a context specific precedence grammar logic for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures. Precedence grammar logic is a set of rule based algorithms (grammar) that are based on the relationships in a local adaptation context. This paper demonstrates the application of a context specific precedence grammar logic in an adaptation context in Can Tho, Vietnam. Adaptation pathways comprising flood adaptation measures (i.e. dike heightening) for this case were generated using rule based algorithms based on the relationships between the drivers and the adaptation measures. The results show that complex adaptation issues that are structured, can be resolved using a context specific adaptation grammar approach. ","Glomalin contributed more to carbon, nutrients in deeper soils, and differently associated with climates and soil properties in vertical profiles Despite vital importance in soil conditioning and a proxy for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF), glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) contribution to soil carbon and nutrients at vertical soil profiles and underlying mechanism were not well-defined yet. Thus, 360 soil samples were collected from 72 farmland 1-m soil profiles in northeastern China, and soil physiochemical properties, nutrients, glomalin characteristics, local climates were determined. Linear decreases of glomalin amounts were observed from the top to deep soils, and glomalin/SOC (glomalin ratio to total SOC) in the 80-100 cm soil (EEG, easily-extracted GRSP, 2.2%; TG, total GRSP, 19%) was 1.34-1.5-fold higher than did in the 0-20 cm soil. Different statistical analyses crosschecked that the lower pH and higher SOC usually accompanied with the higher EEG and TG, while EEG was more sensitive to climates; Moreover, glomalin was more physiochemical-regulated in the deep soils, but more nutrient-regulation was found in the surface soils. Structure Equation Model showed that soil depths and climates indirectly affected TG and EEG features through soil properties, except significant direct effects on EEG. In future, glomalin assessment should fully consider these for identifying the AMF importance in the whole 1-m profile, and our findings also favor degrade soil improvement from glomalin rehabilitation. nan;ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EQUATION MODELING SEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; AGGREGATE STABILITY; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; PROTEIN; MANAGEMENT; FOREST; AFFORESTATION; PLANTATIONS","Vulnerability assessment framework for interdependent critical infrastructures: case-study for Great Britain's rail network Critical infrastructures vulnerability assessment involves understanding various socio-technological aspects of modern day infrastructures. While vulnerabilities exist at different scales, failures of large-scale installations in infrastructures are significant because they lead towards widespread social and economic disruptions. There is growing awareness of the multiple potential causes of failure, including those due to dependence upon other infrastructures. This paper establishes a framework for national analysis of vulnerability of interdependent infrastructures. We present: (i) A mathematical formulation of the vulnerability assessment; (ii) Network models for infrastructures that take in account the geographic, physical and operational characteristics of connecting nodes and edges; (iii) Interdependency mapping models that establish relationships between different subsystems within and across infrastructures; and (iv) Methods for implementing failure and disruption calculations. The methodology is demonstrated for Great Britain's railway infrastructure, for which we have built detailed interdependency mappings between critical assets and infrastructures that support railway operations. Two key vulnerability assessment results, produced to examine failure impacts of such assets on railway passenger trip flows, include: (i) Random failure outcomes; and (ii) Flood vulnerability outcomes. The results show which critical infrastructure interdependencies potentially have large impacts on railway operations, providing a useful analysis tool for further risk and adaptation planning. critical infrastructures; interdependencies; vulnerability assessment; railway networks; transport disruptions;CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; MODEL","The concept of risk society as a model for risk regulation - its hidden and not so hidden ambitions, side effects, and risks Beck's risk society has become a highly influential theory in sociology and has begun to influence risk policy-making and regulation. The theory has been given too much credit, however. This article identifies and analyzes the troubling features of risk society, and demonstrates that it is a loose set of vague ideas, feelings, and hunches, rather than a theory. Risk society, as distinguished from modern industrial society, is a risk management society concerned with the identification and distribution of risks arising from industrial activities, while downplaying natural and other risks. Devoid of empirical content and analytical tools, it promotes a simplistic precautionary anti-industrial environmental and safety ethic. Risk society involves politicization of science and self-interested activism in risk management decision-making. Due to its unrealistic dogmas, ambitions, and side effects, risk society is unable to manage risks effectively and efficiently, and poses a threat to constitutional democracy. Policy-makers and risk managers, therefore, should not rely on risk society theory in designing and implementing risk management structures and regulations. risk society; risk policy; risk management; risk regulation; politicization of science; science in risk regulation; activism; politics of risk regulation;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIOLOGY; POLITICS; THESIS","Effects of Marsh Edge Erosion in Coupled Barrier Island-Marsh Systems and Geometric Constraints on Marsh Evolution Previous results show that overwash provides an important sediment source to back-barrier marshes, sustaining a narrow marsh state under conditions in which marsh drowning would otherwise occur. We expand the coupled barrier island-marsh evolution model GEOMBEST+ to explore the effects of wind waves on back-barrier marshes. We find that the addition of marsh edge erosion leads to wider, more resilient marshes and that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge is a more efficient sediment source than vertical erosion of the marsh surface as it drowns. Where marshes and bays are vertically keeping up with sea level, and the net rate of sediment imported to (or exported from) the basin is known, the rate of marsh edge erosion or progradation can be predicted knowing only the present basin geometry, sea level rise rate, and the net rate of sediment input (without considering the erosion or progradation mechanisms). If the rate of sediment input/export is known, this relationship applies whether sediment exchange with the open ocean is negligible (as in basins dominated by riverine sediment input) or is significant (including the loss of sediment remobilized by waves in the bay). Analysis of these results reveals that geometry and stratigraphy can exert a first-order control on back-barrier marsh evolution and on the marsh-barrier island system as a whole and provides new insights into the resilience of back-barrier marshes and on the interconnectedness of the barrier-marsh system. Plain Language Summary Sand washed across barrier islands during storms (called overwash) provides sediment for salt marshes behind those islands, and can allow a marsh which otherwise would drown to grow vertically fast enough to keep up with sea level. We use a barrier island-marsh evolution model (GEOMBEST+) to see what effect marsh edge erosion by waves has on overwash-supported marshes. Consistent with previous research, we find that wave erosion can make marshes more resilient by freeing sediment that can be used elsewhere on the marsh surface. We add that horizontal erosion of the marsh edge provides more sediment per volume eroded than vertical erosion of the marsh surface. This is because the bottom layers of the marsh contain more sediment (that can stay on marsh surfaces), while the surface layers include plant material (that drifts away or decomposes). We also find that when the marsh and bay are keeping up with sea level, expanding or eroding the marsh is the only way to change the volume of the bay, so how fast the marsh is expanding or eroding can be predicted using geometry, knowing only the size of the basin, sea-level-rise rate, and the net rate of sediment import or export. salt marsh; barrier island;SEA-LEVEL-RISE; MORPHOLOGICAL-BEHAVIOR MODEL; SALT MARSHES; TIDAL FLATS; BRUUN RULE; USA; VIRGINIA; INSIGHTS; STRATIGRAPHY; RESILIENCE","Regime Shifts in the Anthropocene: Drivers, Risks, and Resilience Many ecosystems can experience regime shifts: surprising, large and persistent changes in the function and structure of ecosystems. Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers. nan;SAFE OPERATING SPACE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; SAVANNA; COLLAPSE; ECOLOGY; MODELS; FOREST; FIRE","International expert consensus on the management of allergic rhinitis (AR) aggravated by air pollutants Impact of air pollution on patients with AR: Current knowledge and future strategies Allergic rhinitis affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide.

Different methods have been used to estimate the impact of climate change on human welfare. Studies agree that there are positive and negative impacts. In the short term, positive impacts may dominate, but these are sunk benefits that will obtain regardless of abatement policy. In the longer term, there are net negative impacts. Poorer people tend to be more vulnerable to climate change. Estimated aggregate impacts are not very large, but they are uncertain and incomplete. Estimates of the marginal impacts suggest that greenhouse gas emissions should be taxed and that the emission reduction targets announced by politicians are probably too ambitious. Estimates of the willingness to pay for climate policy suggest that lay people are probably more concerned than experts about the total impact of climate change, whereas lay people and experts agree on estimates of the incremental impact of carbon dioxide emissions.

We assessed the quantitative and spatial changes in land use, land cover, and climate predicted to occur in and around wilderness areas by (1) quantifying projected changes in land use and land cover around wilderness areas; (2) evaluating if public lands surrounding wilderness areas can buffer future land-use change; (3) quantifying future climate conditions in and around wilderness areas; and (4) identifying wilderness areas expected to experience the most change in land use, land cover, and climate. We used projections of land use (four variables), land cover (five variables), and climate (nine variables) to assess changes for 707 wilderness areas in the contiguous United States by mid-21st century under two scenarios (medium-low and high). We ranked all wilderness areas relative to each other by summing and ranking decile values for each land use, land cover, and climate variable and calculating a multivariate metric of future change. All wilderness areas were projected to experience some level of change by mid-century. The greatest land-use changes were associated with increases in agriculture, clear cutting, and developed land, while the greatest land cover changes were observed for grassland, forest, and shrubland. In 51.6% and 73.8% of wilderness areas, core area of natural vegetation surrounding wilderness was projected to decrease for the medium-low and high scenarios, respectfully. Presence of public land did not mitigate the influence of land-use change around wilderness areas. Geographically, projected changes occurred throughout the contiguous U.S., with areas in the northeast and upper Midwest projected to have the greatest land-use and climate change and the southwestern U.S. projected to undergo the greatest land cover and climate change. Our results provide insights into potential future threats to wilderness areas and the challenges associated with wilderness stewardship and climate adaptation. Despite the high degree of protection and remoteness of wilderness areas, effective management and preservation of these lands must consider future changes in land use, land cover, and climate. climate change; land cover; land use; landscape; National Wilderness Preservation System; protected areas; wilderness;UNITED-STATES; EXTREME WEATHER; PROTECTED AREAS; PRESERVATION SYSTEM; FROST DAMAGE; HABITAT LOSS; FUTURE; BIODIVERSITY; FOREST; REPRODUCTION","Smart city and resilient city: Differences and connections Smart city (SC) and resilient city (RC) have been studied and practiced over the years in terms of the increasing urban problems and disasters. However, there is a large overlap between their meanings and relationships. With an increasing concern for both SC and RC in urban development and hazard mitigation, a review was conducted to explore the differences and connections between SC and RC with scientometric analysis. There are far more literatures about SC than RC, and very few papers discuss SC and RC together. The research trend, category, and hotspots from research clusters are illustrated and compared. Major differences are discussed from their objectives, driving force, current research focus, and criticism. The literatures both related to SC and RC are used to explore their connections, which are very limited. The results revealed that the RC's impact on SC are positive from physical, social, and environmental aspects, while SC's impacts on RC could be both positive and negative from the above three aspects. It is indicated that SC and RC are both important for urban planning and can be complementary to each other through proper design and governance, which implies the need for building a resilient smart city (RSC).

We find that environmental shareholder activism increases the voluntary disclosure of climate change risks, especially if initiated by institutional investors, and even more so if initiated by long-term institutional investors. We also find that companies that voluntarily disclose climate change risks following environmental shareholder activism achieve a higher valuation postdisclosure, suggesting that investors value transparency with respect to firms' exposure to climate change risks. Managerial Summary Climate change poses increasing risks to companies. Yet, despite the growing importance of climate change risks, little is known about companies' exposure to climate change risks, their disclosure of these risks, and what strategic actions they take to manage and mitigate these risks. In this study, we examine whether-in the absence of mandatory disclosure-shareholders can elicit greater corporate transparency with respect to climate change risks. We find that shareholder activism is effective, especially if initiated by long-term institutional investors. We also find that the stock market reacts positively to companies' climate risk disclosure following environmental shareholder activism, suggesting that investors value transparency with respect to firms' exposure to climate change risks. ","Vector-borne diseases in cats in Germany Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are caused by a wide range of pathogens, which are transmitted by a variety of vectors, such as ticks and fleas. As a result of climate changes, more vector-borne diseases are becoming endemic in Germany, not only in dogs, but also in cats. For some of the pathogens prevalence data still need to be investigated in Germany. However, natural infections with Bartonella, Anaplasma, haemotropic Mycoplasma and Borrelia species have already been described in German cats. Clinical relevance of these pathogens is not fully understood, and it is still unknown, why most infected cats stay asymptomatic and which predisposing factors contribute to the development of clinical signs in cats. Moreover, there is a risk of zoonotic transmission for some of the pathogens, e.g., for some Bartonella spp. infections that are associated with cat scratch disease in humans. Due to the increasing number of VBDs in cats in Germany, preventive measures, such as the use of acaricides and insecticides, should be performed on a regular base in order to reduce the risk of these infections.

There is, therefore, a great need within emerging global assessment programs, such as the IPBES and other international efforts, to develop functioning mechanisms for legitimate, transparent, and constructive ways of creating synergies across knowledge systems. We present the multiple evidence base (MEB) as an approach that proposes parallels whereby indigenous, local and scientific knowledge systems are viewed to generate different manifestations of knowledge, which can generate new insights and innovations through complementarities. MEB emphasizes that evaluation of knowledge occurs primarily within rather than across knowledge systems. MEB on a particular issue creates an enriched picture of understanding, for triangulation and joint assessment of knowledge, and a starting point for further knowledge generation.

We evaluated aspects of aerobic metabolism and cardiorespiratory physiology of juvenile emerald rockcod, Trematomus bernacchii, an abundant fish in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, to elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P-CO2) [420 (ambient), 650 (moderate) and 1050 (high) mu atm P-CO2] over a 1 month period. We examined cardiorespiratory physiology, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and ventilation rate, whole organism metabolism via oxygen consumption rate and sub-organismal aerobic capacity by citrate synthase enzyme activity. Juvenile fish showed an increase in ventilation rate under high P-CO2 compared with ambient P-CO2, whereas cardiac performance, oxygen consumption and citrate synthase activity were not significantly affected by elevated P-CO2. Acclimation time had a significant effect on ventilation rate, stroke volume, cardiac output and citrate synthase activity, such that all metrics increased over the 4 week exposure period. These results suggest that juvenile emerald rockcod are robust to near-future increases in OA and may have the capacity to adjust for future increases in P-CO2 by increasing acid-base compensation through increased ventilation.

The effect that incorporating trees in cropping systems will have on pest populations, however, also depends on the habitat requirements of the pests themselves. In Eastern Uganda, we studied how shade level (full > 50 trees per acre, moderate 21-50 trees per acre, and low 0-20 trees per acre) and altitude (high 1,717-1,840 m.a.s.l. and low 1,511-1,605 m.a.s.l.) influenced the abundance of the white stem borer Monochamus leuconotus and the coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei. We found that the effect of shade trees differed between the two pest species. The coffee berry borer was more common on sun-exposed plantations, whereas the white stem borer was more common in shaded plantations. Furthermore, the effect of shade level on the white stem borer depended on altitude, with the differences between shade levels being most pronounced in plantations at low altitudes. This implies that the impact of agroforestry on pest regulation both under current conditions and in a global warming scenario will be highly context dependent; it will depend on the identity of the most important pests in the area, and on environmental factors such as altitude.

Ecological restoration, when it was implemented effectively, contributes to improving food and water security, mitigating climate change, protecting biodiversity, boosting economic prosperity and benefiting human health and well-being. Thus, ecological restoration is fundamental for the success of ecological civilization and sustainable development. Ecological restoration theories in developed countries usually require restoring the ecosystem to the status prior to degradation, and this requirement is difficult to achieve in regions with serious degradation, especially in developing countries. We developed a new theory of ecological restoration, or stepwise ecological restoration (STERE), which comprises three modes in different restoration stages: Environmental remediation in the initial stage with serious degradation, ecological rehabilitation for moderately degraded ecosystems, and natural restoration for slightly degraded ecosystems. Environmental remediation aims to reduce environmental pollution through the removal or detoxification of pollutants or excess nutrients from soil and water. Ecological rehabilitation is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed through various physical, chemical and biological restoration strategies. Natural restoration aims to restore ecosystem functions and services and improve ecosystem resilience without much human assistance. Environmental remediation is fundamental and needs to be implemented prior to ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration in places where pollution is severe. Only the former is successfully carried out; however, when the ecosystem is moderately degraded, ecological rehabilitation can be effectively implemented. In places where the ecosystem is slightly degraded, natural restoration is recommended. The processes of ecological rehabilitation and natural restoration will result in ecological functions that are more complete, an increase in biodiversity, and improved ecosystem resilience. For STERE, appropriate restoration goals should be formulated based on the degree of degradation, local funding support, and technological development. The new theory proposed in this study emphasizes the application of reference ecosystems in restoration projects and the importance of ecological monitoring. It also requires an adaptive restoration management framework that considers the influence of global climate change. STERE should be implemented for future ecosystems rather than only for restoring an ecosystem to a status similar to the condition prior to degradation. Moreover, STERE promotes systematic large-scale landscape restoration by considering the interactions between individual small scales (e.g., field scale) and large scales (e.g., catchment scale). In addition, technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing should be more widely used in future STERE projects. Ecological restoration databases should be established for restorative activities in mountains, waters, forests, farms, lakes and other ecosystems. The newly proposed S 1ERE theory would play an important role in developing restoration projects worldwide, especially in developing countries. stepwise ecological restoration (STERE); natural restoration; ecological rehabilitation; environmental remediation; reference ecosystem;ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION; LOESS PLATEAU; LARGE LAKES; CHINA; PROTECTION; POLICY; TIME","Estimation of Future Probable Maximum Precipitation in Korea Using Multiple Regional Climate Models In this study, future probable maximum precipitations (PMPs) based on future meteorological variables produced from three regional climate models (RCMs) of 50-km spatial resolution provided by Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) are projected. In order to estimate future PMPs, the hydro-meteorological method is applied. The key future meteorological variable used to analyze the rate of change of future PMPs is the dew-point temperature. Future 12-h persistence 100-year return period extreme dew-point temperatures obtained from future daily dew-point temperature time series by using the scale-invariance method are applied to estimate future PMPs. As a result of estimating future PMPs using several RCMs and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios, the spatial distribution of future PMPs is expected to be similar to that of the present, but PMPs tend to increase in the future. In addition, it can be seen that the difference in PMPs estimated from various RCMs and RCP scenarios is getting bigger in the future. Especially after 2070, the difference has increased even more. In the short term, it is proposed to establish climate change adaptation policies with an 18% increase in PMPs, which is the ensemble average in the future year 2050. climate change; ensemble; probable maximum precipitation; RCM; scale-invariance;PMP","Effects on Net Irrigation Water Requirement of Joint Distribution of Precipitation and Reference Evapotranspiration To establish the uncertain influence that the joint distribution of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration has on net irrigation water requirement, a Copula function-Monte Carlo method (CFMC) was proposed to calculate the probability of irrigation water requirement. Taking the Jingdian Irrigation District in Northwest China as an example, the distribution laws of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were studied. Furthermore, five typical years under different crop planting structure conditions were selected, and the variation characteristics of net irrigation water requirement in each typical year under the conditions of climate uncertainty were analyzed. The results revealed the optimal distribution functions of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to be gamma distribution and lognormal distribution. The probability density map of the joint distribution of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration has a ""saddle"" shape; that is, irrigation water requirement and reference evapotranspiration are usually inversely related. As the probability of the irrigation water requirement increases, the net irrigation water requirement in the irrigation area also increases. The CFMC method can determine the design value of the net irrigation water requirement under a specific probability for typical years under different crop planting structure conditions, which can provide a reference for agricultural water resource allocation in irrigation areas. irrigation water requirement; precipitation; reference evapotranspiration; copula function; uncertainty;RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PAN EVAPORATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FAO-CROPWAT; RAINFALL; MODEL; DISTRICT; KERALA; WHEAT","Island Tourism-Based Sustainable Development at a Crossroads: Facing the Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic Tourism is often seen as the 'golden ticket' for the development of many islands. The current COVID-19 pandemic, however, has ground global tourism to a halt. In particular, islands that depend heavily on tourist inflows-including mass-tourism islands, and small island developing states (SIDS)-have seen their revenues diminish significantly, and poverty rates increasing. Some alternative-tourism islands have fared better, as they have focused on providing personalized, nature-based experiences to mostly domestic tourists. This article focuses on the experiences of mass-tourism islands, SIDS, and alternative-tourism islands during the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers possible post-pandemic scenarios, as well as recommendations for sustainable island tourism development. Although the pandemic has largely had a negative impact on the tourism sector, this is a unique opportunity for many islands to review the paradigm of tourism development. In this newly emerging world, and under a still very uncertain future scenario, the quadriptych of sustainability is more important than ever. Responsible governance and management of islands' natural resources and their tourism activities, addressing climate change impacts, the diversification of islands' economies, and the promotion of innovative and personalized tourist experiences are all necessary steps towards increasing islands' resilience in case of future economic downturn or health- and environment-related crises. mass-tourism islands; alternative-tourism islands; small island development states (SIDS); sustainability; COVID-19 pandemic;nan","GIS-based regional landslide susceptibility mapping: a case study in southern California Landslides threaten lives and property throughout the United States, causing in excess of $2 billion in damages and 25-50 deaths annually. In regions subjected to urban expansion caused by population growth and/or increased storm intensities caused by changing climate patterns, the economic and society costs of landslides will continue to rise. Using a geographic information system (GIS), this paper develops and implements a multivariate statistical approach for mapping landslide susceptibility. The presented susceptibility maps are intended to help in the design of hazard mitigation and land development policies at regional scales. The paper presents (a) a GIS-based multivariate statistical approach for mapping landslide susceptibility, (b) several dimensionless landslide susceptibility indexes developed to quantify and weight the influence of individual categories for given potential risk factors on landslides and (c) a case study in southern California, which uses 11 111 seismic landslide scars collected from previous efforts and 5389 landslide scars newly digitized from local geologic maps. In the case study, seven potential risk factors were selected to map landslide susceptibility. Ground slope and event precipitation were the most important factors, followed by land cover, surface curvature, proximity to fault, elevation and proximity to coastline. The developed landslide susceptibility maps show that areas classified as having high or very high susceptibilities contained 71% of the digitized landslide scars and 90% of the seismic landslide scars while only occupying 26% of the total study area. These areas mostly have ground slopes higher than 46% and 2-year, 6-hour precipitation greater than 51 rum. Only 12% of digitized landslides and less than 1% of recorded seismic landslides were located in areas classified as low or very low susceptibility, while occupying 42% of the total study region. These areas mostly have slopes less than 27% and 2-year, 6-hour precipitation less than 41 mm.

To evaluate the potential contribution of rooftops rainwater harvesting from hotels sector in the GAM, the potential volume of harvested water was computed based on 29-year rainfall dataset. When comparing the resulting rainwater harvesting potential with yearly water consumption in hotels sector, up to 37.2% of their annual water use can be provided by the harvested water. However, variations of rainfall patterns in the study area may create uncertainty to collecting enough water for good coverage during dry months which extends from May through September. Despite the low replacement (0.7%) of water supplied to the GAM, the harvested water from hotels in (GAM) will enable hotels' management to use it in landscaping, filling the swimming pools, and cleaning. Furthermore, hotels managers or owners may have a tendency toward implementing rainwater harvesting measures in the coming days or years. Thus they act as frontrunners of information dissemination regarding rainwater harvesting measures to other public and private institutions (schools, hospitals, malls, mosques, and churches). To narrow the gap of hotels water needs, rooftops rainwater harvesting should be considered as a supplementary water supply source for hotels sector in the GAM. Because this study assumed some sort of financial hurdles to install water storage tanks, the present study is recommending a governmental funding programs that may encourage hotels owners adopting rainwater harvesting measures.

Streamflow seasonal cycles over the basin are characteristic of the northern region, with the lowest runoff in April and peak flow in June. Analyses of monthly flows and trends show that reservoir construction and operation have considerably affected streamflow regimes. Comparisons of mean monthly discharge records between pre- and post-1986 dam periods indicate that the mid-lower basin (downstream of the dam) experienced significant increase in low flows and decrease in peak flows after dam construction. For example, mean monthly flows during the post-dam period at the Ust'-Srednekan station (located 1423 km downstream of the dam) has strongly increased by about 205 m(3) s(-1) (or 522%-3157%) during December-April, and decreased by 133 m(3) s(-1) (41%) in June. Long-term monthly discharge data reveal an overall increase in streamflow during low flow seasons; the increase is greater for the stations located downstream of the dam. The Srednekolunsk station (1720 km from dam) shows low flow increase ranging from 130 (43%) to 268 m(3) s(-1) (454%) during November-April, and high discharge decrease by 2550 to 519 m(3) s(-1) during June-August in the post-dam era (1986-2000). These changes in flow patterns are mainly caused by reservoir regulation, as reservoirs release water in winter for power generation and store water in summer for flood control. Dam impact on flow regimes and changes are visible along the main river trunk; thus, the cold season discharge increase at the basin outlet is primarily the result of reservoir regulation. Annual discharge records show different changes within the Kolyma basin, with moderate increases in the upper basin and weak decreases in the mid-lower basin. Overall annual discharge near the basin outlet has decreased by 1.5% during 1978-2000. This study emphasizes the importance of human activities (particularly reservoirs) on seasonal and regional hydrology changes and points to the need to further examine natural causes and human impacts over other high-latitude watersheds. nan;FRESH-WATER; AIR-TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARCTIC-OCEAN; SEA ICE; RIVER; DISCHARGE; WORLD; CIRCULATION; ECOSYSTEMS","Consumers' associations, perceptions and acceptance of meat and plant-based meat alternatives The consumption of meat contributes significantly to undesirable effects on the environment. In order to reduce the impact of animal husbandry, one approach is to decrease meat consumption by substituting plant-based meat alternatives. Because the consumption of such meat alternatives is currently rather low, the aim of this research was to identify the barriers that keep people from consuming meat alternatives and increase the probability of future consumption. This was accomplished by exploring free associations people have towards meat and meat alternatives, comparing selected meat products with their respective meat alternatives using the semantic differential, and studying the perceived appropriateness of eating meat alternatives in different consumption situations. To achieve these objectives, we carried out an online survey with participants from Germany (N = 1039). Our results suggest that while meat is being associated with positive terms, meat alternatives were viewed more negatively. The previous findings that meat alternatives should be similar to meat with regard to taste, texture, and ease of preparation were confirmed. Results from the direct comparison of meat with corresponding meat alternatives indicate that meat alternatives are similarly perceived to their processed meat counterparts. Regarding different consumption situations, our results show that eating meat alternatives is perceived to be more appropriate in situations where one eats alone or with family and friends. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that meat alternatives have the best chance of successfully replacing meat when they closely resemble highly processed meat products in taste and texture and are offered at competitive prices. The recommendation for producers of meat alternatives is thus to focus on replicating processed meat products instead of trying to imitate meat cuts such as steak or escalope.

Many legal scholars have called attention to the inability of stationary natural resource management laws to respond to a changing climate. There are various proposals for remedying these laws, including the use of adaptive management, through which resource managers can monitor changes and adjust policies accordingly. Yet there are practical and political challenges to implementing adaptive management. This article considers the extent to which adaptive management has been or could be implemented in response to Alaska's rapid climate change. Alaska is an important case study as it is warming far more quickly than many other parts of the globe, paving the way for species shifts and new commercial and industrial developments. The article is informed by interviews with twelve natural resource managers and researchers in Alaska as well as additional interviews with Alaskan agency representatives and community members. It concludes that adaptive management is occurring at small scales in Alaska and elsewhere, typically involving actions by lower-level managers in the context of permits or regulations that apply to a single species. These adaptive measures may not be labeled as ""adaptive management"" in agency regulations or even directly provided for in regulations, but they occur in spite of the many challenges to adaptive management. nan;CHANGE ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY","Applying the DPSIR framework to qualitatively assess the globally important mangrove ecosystems of Indonesia: A review towards evidence-based policymaking approaches Indonesia has the largest extent of mangroves globally, supporting communities at the local scale while contributing to climate change mitigation at the global scale. Yet, they are highly threatened by multiple anthropogenic and natural stressors. Thus, in this study, we aim to qualitatively assess Indonesia's mangrove ecosystems by conducting a literature review applying the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. By using the framework, we identified multiple stressors and existing management efforts in 27 provinces of Indonesia. For instance, we identified aquaculture expansion as the most frequented driver of mangrove loss leading to the conversion of mangroves to shrimp farms in 20 provinces. In terms of responses, mangrove rehabilitation and community-based management have a long history in Indonesia while economic valuation and payment of ecosystem services are yet to be established across the country. The identification of multiple stressors and/or threats is instrumental to addressing the causes of degradation of globally-important mangroves in Indonesia if effectively translated into policies, which remains a future challenge.

Intermittent renewable energy sources (intermittent-RES) such as wind and solar PV can be a key component of the resulting low-carbon power systems. Their intermittency will require more flexibility from the rest of the power system to maintain system stability. In this study, the efficacy of five complementary options to integrate intermittent-RES at the lowest cost is evaluated with the PLEXUS hourly power system simulation tool for Western Europe in the year 2050. Three scenarios.to reduce CO2 emissions by 96% and maintain system reliability are investigated: 40%, 60% and 80% of annual power generation by RES. This corresponds to 22%, 41% and 59% of annual power generation by intermittent-RES. This study shows that higher penetration of RES will increase the total system costs: they increase by 12% between the 40% and 80% RES scenarios. Key drivers are the relatively high investment costs and integration costs of intermittent-RES. It is found that total system costs can be reduced by: (1) Demand response (DR) (2-3% reduction compared to no DR deployment); (2) natural gas-fired power plants with and without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) (12% reduction from mainly replacing RES power generation between the 80% and 40% RES scenarios); (3) increased interconnection capacity (0-1% reduction compared to the current capacity); (4) curtailment (2% reduction in 80% RES scenario compared to no curtailment); (5) electricity storage increases total system costs in all scenarios (0.1-3% increase compared to only current storage capacity). The charging costs and investment costs make storage relatively expensive, even projecting cost reductions of 40% for Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) and 70% for batteries compared to 2012. All scenarios are simulated as energy only markets, and experience a ""revenue gap"" for both complementary options and other power generators: only curtailment and DR are profitable due to their low cost. The revenue gap becomes progressively more pronounced in the 60% and 80% RES scenarios, as the low marginal costs of RES reduce electricity prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we systematically examine the impact of buildings on downward surface solar fluxes over urban Beijing by using a 3-D radiation parameterization that accounts for 3-D building structures vs. the conventional plane-parallel scheme. We find that the resulting downward surface solar flux deviations between the 3-D and the plane-parallel schemes are generally +/- 1-10aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) at 800aEuro-m grid resolution and within +/- 1aEuro-WaEuro-m(-2) at 4aEuro-km resolution. Pairs of positive-negative flux deviations on different sides of buildings are resolved at 800aEuro-m resolution, while they offset each other at 4aEuro-km resolution. Flux deviations from the unobstructed horizontal surface at 4aEuro-km resolution are positive around noon but negative in the early morning and late afternoon. The corresponding deviations at 800aEuro-m resolution, in contrast, show diurnal variations that are strongly dependent on the location of the grids relative to the buildings. Both the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of flux deviations are largely dominated by the direct flux. Furthermore, we find that flux deviations can potentially be an order of magnitude larger by using a finer grid resolution. Atmospheric aerosols can reduce the magnitude of downward surface solar flux deviations by 10-65aEuro-%, while the surface albedo generally has a rather moderate impact on flux deviations. The results imply that the effect of buildings on downward surface solar fluxes may not be critically significant in mesoscale atmospheric models with a grid resolution of 4aEuro-km or coarser. However, the effect can play a crucial role in meso-urban atmospheric models as well as microscale urban dispersion models with resolutions of 1aEuro-m to 1aEuro-km. nan;GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; SIERRA-NEVADA; CANOPY MODEL; MESOSCALE MODELS; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; PARAMETERIZATION; SIMULATION; CHINA; PERFORMANCE; MULTILAYER","THE ROLE OF BORDER CARBON ADJUSTMENTS IN A U.S. CARBON TAX This paper examines carbon tax design options in the United States using an intertemporal computable general equilibrium model of the world economy called G-Cubed. In this paper, we discuss four policy scenarios that explore two overarching issues: (1) the effects of a carbon tax under alternative assumptions about the use of the resulting revenue, and (2) the effects of a system of import charges on carbon-intensive goods (""border carbon adjustments"" or BCAs). Consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax raises considerable revenue and reduces CO2 emissions significantly relative to baseline, no matter how the revenue is used. Gross annual revenue from the carbon tax with lump sum rebating and no BCA begins at $110 billion in 2020 and rises gradually to $170 billion in 2040. By 2040, annual CO2 emissions fall from 5.5 billion metric tons (BMT) under the baseline to 2.4 BMT, a decline of 3.1 BMT, or 57%. Cumulative emissions over 2020 to 2040 fall by 48 BMT. Also consistent with earlier studies, we find that the carbon tax has very small overall impacts on gross domestic product (GDP), wages, employment, and consumption. Different uses of the revenue from the carbon tax result in slightly different levels and compositions of GDP across consumption, investment and net exports. Overall, using carbon tax revenue to reduce the capital income tax rate results in better macroeconomic outcomes than using the revenue for lump sum transfers. Counter to their purported purpose of protecting U.S. trade strength, for a given revenue policy, BCAs tend to produce lower net exports than the carbon taxes alone. This is generally because the BCAs raise the value of the dollar relative to other currencies, thus lowering exports more than they lower imports. This is consistent with standard results in the international trade literature on the effects of import tariffs and export subsidies on real exchange rates, a result that is often overlooked in the discussion of domestic carbon policy. In a finding new to the literature, our results show that BCAs can have strikingly different effects depending on the use of the revenue. Under a lump sum rebate, BCAs exacerbate the impact of the carbon tax by lowering domestic output further than it would fall under the carbon tax alone. Under a capital tax swap, however, BCAs have a moderating effect: they reduce the impact of the tax on most industries. ","The behavioural and physiological ecology of embryos: responding to the challenges of life inside an egg Adaptations of post-hatching animals have attracted far more study than have embryonic responses to environmental challenges, but recent research suggests that we have underestimated the complexity and flexibility of embryos. We advocate a dynamic view of embryos as organisms capable of responding - on both ecological and evolutionary timescales - to their developmental environments. By viewing embryos in this way, rather than assuming an inability of pre-hatching stages to adapt and respond, we can broaden the ontogenetic breadth of evolutionary and ecological research. Both biotic and abiotic factors affect embryogenesis, and embryos exhibit a broad range of behavioural and physiological responses that enable them to deal with changes in their developmental environments in the course of interactions with their parents, with other embryos, with predators, and with the physical environment. Such plasticity may profoundly affect offspring phenotypes and fitness, and in turn influence the temporal and spatial dynamics of populations and communities. Future research in this field could benefit from an integrated framework that combines multiple approaches (field investigations, manipulative experiments, ecological modelling) to clarify the mechanisms and consequences of embryonic adaptations and plasticity. behavioural response; developmental programming; ecological consequence; embryonic development; embryo cooperation; embryo conflict; offspring; parental effect; phenotypic plasticity;DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION; OVIPOSITION SITE SELECTION; PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT; FILIAL CANNIBALISM; PREDATION RISK; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; MATERNAL MANIPULATION; ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMOREGULATORY BEHAVIOR","Responses of Total Biomass, Shoot Dry Weight, Yield and Yield Components of Jerusalem Artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) Varieties under Different Terminal Drought Duration As a secondary crop planting in the double-cropping system, terminal drought is the major constraint of Jerusalem artichoke production in the rainfed area. This study aims to estimate the effects of different durations of terminal drought on total biomass, tuber yields, harvest index, yield components, and to identify high yield potential and low yield reduction genotypes for the varietal improvement program. A split-plot design with four replications was conducted under field experiment for two years. Three drought durations including non-drought stress (SD0), drought from 60 and 45 days after transplanting until harvest (SD1 and SD2, respectively), were assigned in main plots and six genotypes were arranged in subplots. Crop parameters were greater decreased under a long-drought duration than under short-drought duration. The genotypes were identified; HEL256, JA37 and JA125 had high yield potential under SD0 conditions, whereas there was high yield reduction under drought conditions. In contrast, JA60 and HEL253 were identified as low yield potential and low yield reduction genotypes. This information suggested that high yield potential genotypes and low yield reduction genotypes should be selected and generated progeny population for improvement of new varieties with high yield potential and low yield reduction for growing in terminal drought-prone environments. high yield potential; low yield reduction; economic yield; harvest index; drip irrigation; field capacity; soil moisture content;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; GENOTYPIC VARIABILITY; TRAITS; STRESS; GROWTH; INULIN","Invasions by ladybugs, ladybirds, and other predatory beetles Species of predatory Coleoptera have become abundant in new geographic regions recently, raising concerns for invaded ecosystems. We address this topic by focusing on invasive alien ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae; known also as ladybugs). Humans appear directly or indirectly responsible for all or most ladybird invasions. Factors hypothesized to have promoted ladybird invasions include genetic diversity (e.g., for polymorphism), phenotypic plasticity, adaptation and genetic shift, generalized diet and habitat preferences, flexible life history and reproduction, large body size, and release from enemies. Factors such as climate, habitat and prey availability, and biotic resistance may sometimes prevent or slow ladybird invasions. Indigenous species (e.g., herbivores) may suffer from invasions, and biological control programs may be affected. Species of indigenous ladybirds throughout the world are reported to have declined in abundance following ladybird invasions, with increased competition and/or intraguild predation most often hypothesized or inferred. Similar recent studies especially of ground beetles (Carabidae) also make clear the potential of invasive alien predatory Coleoptera to disrupt invaded natural and agricultural ecosystems.

The main goal of this experiment was to assess the effect of urease inhibitors on N use efficiency, N losses, and their economic impact in a maize-wheat field experiment. In this study, 10 treatments were compared, combining the urea fertilizer with or without urease inhibitor, applied in one or two dressings, and under optimal or sub-optimal irrigation. A single application of urease inhibitor (IN1d), coupled with the conventional urea, helped to reduce the nitrate leaching risk both during the maize period (even when compared to the two dressing treatment) and after harvest. In addition, this improvement was achieved together with an increase in economic benefit, even when compared with the application of the same amount of regular urea split into two dressings. Under low water availability systems, the benefits of applying urease inhibitors increased with respect to the application of regular urea, making this technique a very promising strategy for adaptation to climate change in arid and semiarid regions. sustainable cropping systems; nitrate leaching; ammonia volatilization; fertilizer management;NITRIFICATION INHIBITORS; EMISSIONS; AMMONIA; YIELD; N2O; PRODUCTIVITY; AIRBORNE; SENSORS; LOSSES; IMPACT","Re-balancing climate services to inform climate-resilient planning - A conceptual framework and illustrations from sub-Saharan Africa Making climate-resilient planning and adaptation decisions is, in part, contingent on the use of climate information. Growing attention has been paid to the ""usability gap"" and the need to make information both useful and useable to decision-makers. Less attention has, however, been paid to the factors that determine whether, once created, useful and useable information is then actually used. In this Perspectives piece, we outline a framework that puts together the pieces necessary to close the ""usability gap"" - highlighting not only what is required to make information useful and useable, but also what is required to ensure that useful and useable information is actually used. Creating useful information is subject to understanding and being able to deliver metrics that address identified needs in a range of decision-making contexts. Creating useable information requires legitimate and credible information that is visualised and communicated in ways that are accessible and understandable. The framework highlights traditionally under-recognized enablers necessary to promote effective use of the growing availability of useful and useable climate information in decision-making; supportive institutions, appropriate policy frameworks, capacity of individuals and agency to make decisions. Whilst this is not enough in itself to effect information use, we argue that greater focus on these enablers can re-balance the activities promoted through climate services and increase the likelihood of successful use. We illustrate the framework with case examples of co-producing climate information for the tea and water sectors in sub-Saharan Africa.

Although many empirical studies report the influence of climate change on crop yield, only few address the effect on yield variances. Even in such cases, the reported yield variances were obtained through simulation studies rather than from actual observations. In this context, the present study analyzes the impact of climate change on crops yield and yield variance using the observed yields. Design/methodology/approach - The Just-Pope yield function (1978) is used to analyze the impact of climate change on mean yield and variance. The estimated coefficient from Just-Pope yield function and the projected climatic data for the year 2030 are incorporated to capture the projected changes in crop yield and variances. Findings - By the year 2030, the yield of pulses is estimated to decline in all the zones (Northeast, Northwest, Western, Cauvery delta, South and Southern zones), with significant declines in the Northeast zone (6.07 per cent), Cauvery delta zone (3.55 per cent) and South zone (3.54 per cent). Sorghum yield may suffer more in Western zone (2.63 per cent), Southern zone (1.92 per cent) and Northeast zone (1.62 per cent). Moreover, the yield of spiked millet is more likely to decrease in the Southern zone (1.39 per cent), Northeast zone (1.21 per cent) and Cauvery delta zone (0.24 per cent), and the yield of cotton may also decline in the Northeast zone (12.99 per cent), Northwest zone (8.05 per cent) and Western zone (2.10 per cent) of Tamil Nadu, India. Originality/value - The study recommends introducing appropriate crop insurance policies to address possible financial losses to the farmers. Prioritizing area-specific stress-tolerant crop varieties without complementing yield would sustain crops cultivation further.

The global extent of marine protected areas (MPAs) has increased rapidly in the last decade, and monitoring and evaluation are now required for effective and adaptive management of these areas. 2. We classify monitoring in MPAs into four categories and identify a critically important, but undervalued category: human pressure monitoring that targets human activities and their impacts. 3. Human pressure monitoring is fundamental for interpreting the results of ecological performance monitoring and for evaluating MPA management effectiveness. The consequences of ecological performance monitoring that show unsuccessful MPA performance while falsely assuming successful mitigation of human pressures could jeopardize MPA performance analysis and adaptive management, and thus be worse than not monitoring at all. 4. Human pressure monitoring enables using MPAs as reference areas where the effects of global or regional pressures (e.g. climate change) can be disentangled from the effects of local human activities, as well as to minimize the shifting baseline phenomenon in defining healthy stocks. These benefits cannot be realized without active human pressure monitoring integrated into an adaptive management cycle that ensures effective MPA protection. 5. In the absence of human pressure monitoring, all ecological monitoring within MPAs falls in the ambient monitoring category: monitoring that is not intended to measure conservation outcomes. 6. We discuss the implications for monitoring programme design and provide a structure for decision-makers on how to prioritize monitoring activities within MPAs that place greater emphasis onimprovingMPAs as biodiversity conservation tools overprovingMPA performance. biodiversity targets; conservation evaluation; human pressure; marine parks; marine reserves; ocean;CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSERVATION OUTCOMES; RESERVES; ENVIRONMENT; CHALLENGES; DIVERSITY; FISHERY; IMPACTS; LINE","Indigenous benefits and carbon offset schemes: An Australian case study The nexus between human rights and the environment is a key issue for climate policymakers and Indigenous peoples around the world. We combine national spatial, social and biological datasets from Australia to describe where Indigenous carbon projects are happening, why Indigenous people are participating, and how effective these schemes might be at marrying Indigenous co-benefit, biodiversity and carbon emission mitigation goals. Our study shows that many Indigenous people engage in carbon offset schemes as part of their broader cultural responsibility for landscapes, and that they seek to grow the relationship between social and ecological benefits. It also highlights the challenges associated with designing carbon offset schemes that address the impacts of climate change and respond to Indigenous peoples' world views about what is required to sustain cultural-social-ecological systems.

Greenhouse gases produced by agricultural machinery and fertilizers during agricultural production are an important cause of climate change. On the basis of the above facts, researching the connection between agricultural mechanization, climate change, and agricultural carbon emissions is crucial for the development of low-carbon agriculture and for addressing climate change. We used a variety of econometric models and methods to analyze data from China's multiple provinces (cities) covering the years 2000 through 2019, in order to meet the research objectives. Furthermore, we utilized rainfall and sunlight as variables to assess climate change and adopted Granger tests to establish the link between rainfall, sunlight, agricultural mechanization, and carbon emissions in farming. The findings indicate a bidirectional causality relationship between rainfall, sunlight, agricultural mechanization, and carbon emissions in farming. Rainfall and sunlight are Granger causes of agricultural mechanization. Furthermore, agricultural mechanization has favorable effects on carbon emissions of agriculture, and climate change has long-term implications on agricultural mechanization and carbon emissions of agriculture. Finally, this paper investigated the green path suitable for the low-carbon development of Chinese agriculture, arguing that the government should formulate low-carbon agricultural policies by region and actively promote the upgrading of agricultural machinery. climate change; agricultural carbon emission; agricultural mechanization; agricultural production;REGRESSION; ADAPTATION; INFERENCE; IMPACTS; ENERGY","Anticipating moral hazard undermines climate mitigation in an experimental geoengineering game Geoengineering is sometimes touted as a partial solution to climate change but will only be successful in conjunction with other mitigation strategies. This creates a potential for a ""moral hazard"": If people think geoengineering alone will mitigate climate change, they may become overly optimistic and reduce support for other necessary mitigation efforts. We test this in a series of economic games where players in groups must prevent a simulated climate disaster. One player, the ""policymaker,"" decides whether to implement geo-engineering. The rest are ""citizens"" who decide how much to contribute to incremental mitigation efforts. We find that citizens contribute to mitigation even when the policymaker uses geoengineering. Despite this, poli-cymakers expect that citizens will engage in moral hazard. As a consequence, policymakers do not use geo-engineering even though everyone would be better off if they did so. Anticipating moral hazard undermines mitigation even though moral hazard itself does not.

Despite the potential benefits of cropping systems diversity, few farmers in the US Corn Belt use diverse rotations. This study examines factors that may influence farmers' decisions to use more diversified crop rotations in the US Corn Belt through a parallel convergent mixed methods approach, using a multi-level analysis of Corn Belt farmer survey data (n = 4,778) and in-depth interviews (n = 159). Analyses were conducted to answer questions regarding what factors influence farmers' use of extended crop rotations in intensive corn-based cropping systems and to explore whether farmers in the Corn Belt might use extended crop rotations in response to climatic changes. Findings suggest that path dependency associated with the intensive corn-based cropping system in the region limits farmers' ability to integrate more diverse crop rotations. However, farmers in more diversified watersheds, those who farm marginal land, and those with livestock are more likely to use extended rotations. Additionally, farmers who currently use more diverse rotations are also more likely to plan to use crop rotations as a climate change adaptation strategy. If more diverse cropping systems are desired to reduce climate risks, in addition to reducing the negative impacts associated with industrial agricultural production, then further efforts must be made to facilitate more diverse crop rotations in the U.S. Corn Belt. This may be achieved by adjusting policy and economic incentives that presently discourage cropping system diversity in the region.

Households were chosen randomly in districts that are representative for key agro-climatic zones and farming systems. The data set specifies farming systems characteristics that can help inform about the importance of each system for a country's agricultural production and its ability to cope with short-and long-term climate changes or extreme weather events.

Unlike the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement does not enshrine differentiated substantive mitigation obligations for developed and developing countries. However, an increasingly proceduralized variant of the CBDR principle, which facilitates regard for the interests of developing countries with respect to treaty implementation yet does not guarantee favourable substantive outcomes for these states, is evident in the emerging regime. The experience of the International Maritime Organization's climate change regime provides a cautionary tale with respect to procedurally oriented differentiation that is not reinforced by effective processes to ensure that developed states honour their finance and technology transfer commitments. Accordingly, this article posits that strong accountability mechanisms are required to transform opportunities for procedural differentiation in the Paris Agreement into a robust framework for procedural regard for the interests of developing states.

Yet public opinion on climate change is complex, with individuals differing on three key opinion dimensions: belief and concern, issue salience, and support for government action. In this study, we investigate how these dimensions intersect at the individual level. Based on data from an online survey conducted in 2018 in the United Kingdom (N = 787), a latent class analysis reveals that there are five climate change opinion publics. The two largest publics have strong beliefs that climate change is occurring, but view it as a low salience issue, or are wary of government action to address it. We also investigate sociopolitical covariates of each public. By providing a detailed picture of climate change views, these findings can help us to better understand the relationship between public opinion and climate policy. climate change; issue salience; public opinion; United Kingdom;CHANGE PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; SKEPTICISM; IMPACT; POLICY; UK; DETERMINANTS; ORIENTATION; ADAPTATION; DOMINANCE","Water Retention Performance at Low-Impact Development (LID) Field Sites in Taipei, Taiwan Low-impact development (LID) aims to retain stormwater at source sites rather than achieve water drainage. The infiltration and storage of rainwater on site is the most commonly applied LID design concept, turning impervious pavements into pervious pavements. In this study, three field sites in Taipei city, Taiwan, were monitored. Two of the sites were located on campuses, and one site was a roadside location. They were constructed at different times and had distinct purposes, but the common design aspect was the infiltration function of the ground surface. We monitored the water retention performance at the above three sites and applied a verified stormwater management model (SWMM) to characterize the performance at these case sites. The observed data show that if the accumulative rainfall was lower than 20 mm, the water retention rate at each of the three case sites reached almost 50%; at 60 mm rainfall, the rate was 40%. With increased rainfall amount, the water retention rate decreased because the storage capacity was limited. Because water retention is typically controlled by the infiltration capacity, the rainfall intensity dominated the performance. At the three field sites, the water retention rate was 40% on average at a rainfall intensity below 20 mm/h. Above this rainfall intensity, the infiltration performance of the pervious pavement decreased. The verified model was applied to assess the performance at the three sites under the Taipei city drainage system design standard, i.e., the five-year recurrent period storm level, at 78.8 mm/h. The results demonstrate that the water retention rates were 9.1%, 14.2%, and 61.0% at the three sites, indicating that the pervious pavement could reduce the loading of the current stormwater drainage system. Dispersed sites should be considered in urban stormwater management to mitigate flooding risk in urban areas. pervious pavement; infiltration; low-impact development (LID); SWMM; urban stormwater management;nan","Livelihood Adaptation of Rural Households under Livelihood Stress: Evidence from Sichuan Province, China The welfare of many poor and low-income rural households is vulnerable to earthquakes and secondary geological disasters. The academic literature, however, pays little attention to the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategies of these households. Based on the survey data of 327 rural households in the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in the Sichuan Province, the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategy characteristics of rural households were analyzed, and the disordered multi-classification logistic regression model was constructed to explore the correlation between the above-mentioned variables. The results show that: (1) Rural households face the greatest economic pressure and the least social pressure; rural households have the strongest adaptability in social capital and the lowest adaptability in financial capital. The proportion of rural households that chose the aid livelihood strategy was the highest, while the proportion of rural households that chose the adjustment livelihood strategy was the lowest. (2) Compared with the expanded livelihood strategy, (a) When the health pressure is higher, the rural households are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy, followed by the contractive livelihood strategy and, finally, the aid livelihood strategies; (b), the higher the physical capital, the more often the rural households tend to choose the expanded livelihood strategy compared to the adjustment livelihood strategy; (c), The higher the financial capital of farm households, the more they prefer contractive livelihood strategies compared to the expanded livelihood strategy and (d), compared with the aid livelihood strategy, rural households with greater economic pressure are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy.This study can provide a reference for the establishment of relevant policies related to the adaptation capacity of rural households in the earthquake hazard zone. livelihood pressure; livelihood adaptability; livelihood strategies; earthquake disaster areas; Sichuan;CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; DISASTER-PREPAREDNESS; RISK PERCEPTION; LAND TRANSFER; SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD; POVERTY VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; FOOD PRODUCTIVITY; MOUNTAINOUS AREAS; FARM HOUSEHOLDS","Assessing the potential to mitigate climate-related expansion of largemouth bass populations using angler harvest Climate-related changes in fish communities can present new challenges for fishery managers who must address declines in cool- and cold-water sportfish while dealing with increased abundance of warm-water sportfish. We used largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in Wisconsin lakes as model populations to determine whether angler harvest provides a realistic method for reducing abundance of a popular warm-water sportfish that has become more prevalent and has prompted management concerns around the globe. Model results indicate largemouth bass will be resilient to increased fishing mortality. Furthermore, high rates of voluntary catch-and-release occurring in most largemouth bass fisheries likely preclude fishing mortality rates required to reduce bass abundance at meaningful levels (>= 25% reductions). Increasing fishing mortality in these scenarios may require more ""stimulus"" than merely providing anglers with greater harvest opportunities via less stringent harvest regulations. Angler harvest could result in populations dominated by small fish, a scenario that may be undesirable to anglers, but could provide ecological benefits in certain situations. nan;CATCH-AND-RELEASE; FRESH-WATER FISHES; SMALLMOUTH BASS; NORTHERN PIKE; LENGTH LIMITS; CRAPPIE RECRUITMENT; BLACK BASS; MICROPTERUS-SALMOIDES; TROUT POPULATIONS; WISCONSIN LAKES","Climate change impact and adaptation for highway asphalt pavements: a literature review For the past few decades, researchers all over the world have agreed that the service life of civil infrastructure is significantly affected by climate change.

Marine natural capital provides the flow of ""marine ecosystem services"" that are directly used or enjoyed by people providing benefits to human well-being. They include provisioning services (e.g., food), regulation and maintenance services (e.g., carbon sequestration and storage, and coastal protection), and cultural services (e.g., tourism and recreational benefits). In recent decades, human activities have increased the pressures on marine ecosystems, often leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, in turn, affecting their ability to provide benefits to humans. Therefore, effective management strategies are crucial to the conservation of healthy and diverse marine ecosystems and to ensuring their long-term generation of goods and services. Biophysical, economic, and sociocultural assessments of marine ecosystem services are much needed to convey the importance of natural resources to managers and policy makers supporting the development and implementation of policies oriented for the sustainable management of marine resources. In addition, the accounting of marine ecosystem service values can be usefully complemented by their mapping to enable the identification of priority areas and management strategies and to facilitate science-policy dialogue. Given this premise, this study aims to review trends and evolution in the concept of marine ecosystem services. In particular, the global scientific literature on marine ecosystem services is explored by focusing on the following main aspects: the definition and classification of marine ecosystem services; their loss due to anthropogenic pressures, alternative assessment, and mapping approaches; and the inclusion of marine ecosystem services into policy and decision-making processes. marine ecosystems; ecosystem services; benefits to humans; biophysical assessment; economic valuation;CLIMATE-CHANGE; DECISION-MAKING; COASTAL; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; SUPPORT; FLOWS","Diabetes and Disasters: Recent Studies and Resources for Preparedness Purpose of Review Studies have shown that disasters may exacerbate the comorbidities in vulnerable populations such as those with a pre-existing chronic medical condition like diabetes.

Those data are used for different applications, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, etc. The applications are data driven and mostly interdisciplinary. Based on this it can truly be stated that we are now living in the age of big remote sensing data. Furthermore, these data are becoming an economic asset and a new important resource in many applications. In this paper, we specifically analyze the challenges and opportunities that big data bring in the context of remote sensing applications. Our focus is to analyze what exactly does big data mean in remote sensing applications and how can big data provide added value in this context. Furthermore, this paper describes the most challenging issues in managing, processing, and efficient exploitation of big data for remote sensing problems. In order to illustrate the aforementioned aspects, two case studies discussing the use of big data in remote sensing are demonstrated. In the first test case, big data are used to automatically detect marine oil spills using a large archive of remote sensing data. In the second test case, content-based information retrieval is performed using high-performance computing (HPC) to extract information from a large database of remote sensing images, collected after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center in New York City. Both cases are used to illustrate the significant challenges and opportunities brought by the use of big data in remote sensing applications.

Law both creates and is created by the relationship between people and place, although it rarely acknowledges this. Law frequently operates as if space does not matter. Law and legal processes, therefore, deserve greater attention from geographers. Legal geography is an emerging field of inquiry that facilitates much-needed attention to the interrelationships among the environment, people and social institutions, including formal laws but also informal rules, norms and lore. Legal geographers seek to make the invisible visible: to bring the law into the frame of geography, and space and place into focus for the law. Both critical and applied in approach, legal geography offers descriptive, analytical and normative insight into economics, justice, property, power, geopolitics, governance and scale. As such it can enrich most areas of geographic inquiry as well as contribute to current policy debates about the regulation of space and place. Legal geography is a way for enlarged appreciations of relationality, materiality, multiscalarity and agency to be used to interrogate and reform the law. This introduction to a special themed paper' section of Geographical Research provides a window on legal geography scholarship, including its history, contribution and ambition.

A key governance challenge is operationalizing standards for the permanence of carbon sequestered in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. There are multiple risks of reversal of carbon storage in these ecosystems and release of carbon back to the atmosphere. This paper reviews issues of permanence in four approaches for carbon removal focusing on carbon uptake and potential side-effects of long-term land commitments. Recognizing that permanence is a considerable barrier to large-scale application of land-based carbon removal, we argue that temporary carbon storage can still provide climate benefits in the short run. A multilateral governance framework should redefine permanence requirements and reflect principles of sustainability, polycentricity, and land stewardship. nan;FOREST; LAND; SEQUESTRATION; IMPACTS; CLIMATE; STORAGE; AGROECOSYSTEMS; ADDITIONALITY; REFORESTATION; CHALLENGES","Photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence regulation of upland cotton (Gossiypium hirsutum L.) under drought conditions To investigate physiological characteristics of photosynthesis at different stages of growth, the transgenic cultivar Lumianyan28 was treated under two conditions with relative water content of < 60% (drought treatment) and 70-80% (well watered control), respectively. Results obtained from leaves of main stem showed that drought decreased the transpiration efficiency and inner transpiration efficiency of functional leaves which refers to the forth main stem leave from top before tip pruning, and thereafter, refers to the third one or the second one in the later period. It can be inferred that plants were most sensitive to soil drought at the initial bloom stage. Due possibly to the reduction of thylakoid stacking, the content of chlorophyll a/b and net photosynthetic rate of the water-stressed plants were significantly lower than those of the well-watered control plants at the initial bloom stage. The transpiration rate of the functional leaves under drought treatment was remarkably higher than those of control plants at the bud stage, showing the relative significance of transpiration. The photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) of the main stem leaves correlated with the net photosynthetic rate under drought treatment (correlation coefficient=0.907*). However, such a correlation was not detected in the well-watered leaves. These results suggested that regulating photosynthetic system at crucial stages was the defense response of cotton plant to drought. However, this ability was very limited and progressively reduced along with prolonged drought. electronic transmission rate; fluorescence; functional leaves; photosynthesis; transpiration rate;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; FIELD CONDITIONS; LEAF MOVEMENT; STRESS; LIMITATIONS; TRANSPIRATION; GRAPEVINES; CULTIVARS; RESPONSES","Assessing the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Anthropogenic Impacts on Remotely Sensed Vegetation Dynamics in Xinjiang, China The dynamics of the ecosystem represented by vegetation under the influence of human activities have become an important issue in the study of the regional ecological environment. Xinjiang is one of the most ecologically fragile areas in the world, and vegetation changes have received extensive attention. Xinjiang is one of the most ecologically fragile areas in the world, and vegetation changes have received extensive attention. However, the spatiotemporal patterns and evolutionary trends of anthropogenic impacts on vegetation dynamics in Xinjiang are still unclear. In this study, the anthropogenic impacts on vegetation dynamics were quantitatively assessed by combining the improved normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) prediction model and the residual analysis method in Xinjiang, China. The human driving factors were analyzed with the support of a stepwise multiple regression model for vegetation changes at the county scale. Based on trend analysis and the Hurst exponent, the spatiotemporal characteristics and evolutionary trends of the impact of human activities on vegetation change were discussed. The results show that (1) the NDVI values in Xinjiang showed a gradually increasing trend at a rate of 0.005/10 years from 1982 to 2018, and the vegetation dynamics mainly showed significant improvements (57.09% of the vegetated areas), especially for crops. (2) The anthropogenic effects of vegetation changes in Xinjiang mainly included positive impact increases (43.22% of the vegetated areas) from 2000 to 2018. Human activities promoted the increase in the NDVI of various vegetation types. Both the positive and negative impacts of human activities increased over the study period, and the growth rate of the positive influence (0.08%/10 years) was higher than that of the negative influence (0.04%/10 years). (3) The cultivated area, GDP of primary industry, and population are the main anthropogenic factors causing the increase in NDVI, which dominate the vegetation greening in 30.34%, 29.22%, and 28.09% of the counties in Xinjiang, respectively. The animal husbandry population, agricultural population, and livestock number are the main anthropogenic factors causing the decrease in NDVI, which dominate the vegetation degradation in 23.60%, 21.35%, and 17.98% of the counties in Xinjiang, respectively. (4) The evolutionary trend of the anthropogenic impact on vegetation dynamics in Xinjiang will be dominated by anti-persistence (53.84% of the vegetated areas), thereby mainly showing that the positive impacts continued to increase (22.56% of the vegetated areas), especially for crops, shrubs, grasslands, and alpine vegetation. Our results are helpful in understanding the characteristics and evolutionary trends of vegetation changes in arid areas caused by human activities and are of significance as a reference for policymakers to appropriately adjust policy guidance in a timely manner to promote the protection and sustainable development of fragile ecosystems. vegetation dynamics; normalized difference vegetation index; anthropogenic impact; spatiotemporal pattern; evolutionary trend;CLIMATE-CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; INNER-MONGOLIA; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; LOESS PLATEAU; COVER CHANGE; LAND-USE; RESPONSES; REGION; WATER","Influence of Park Size and Its Surrounding Urban Landscape Patterns on the Park Cooling Effect Urban parks, an essential component of urban green infrastructure, are known for their multiple ecosystem services to the residents in the cities. Mitigating the urban heat island (UHI) effects is one of such services. Scientific understanding on how park size and surrounding landscape pattern influence its cooling effect, however, remains poor. Using 39 parks in Shanghai, China, this paper aims to understand the relationship of land surface temperature (LST) with park size and the impacts of the surrounding landscape patterns on parks' cooling effect. The results show that the parks' LST decreased logarithmically with park size. There are nonlinear relationships between park sizes and their cooling effects. Large parks do not have advantages over small ones in the efficiency of cooling the surrounding environment. Both the class and landscape level patterns surrounding the parks influence the cooling effect. The proportion and dominance of urban land use types negatively affect park cooling effect, but enhanced shape complexity of urban land-use types could alleviate their adverse impact. However, the surrounding natural and seminatural landscape types facilitate the park cooling effect. These findings are valuable for landscape and urban planning.

Cosmopolitan freshwater cyanobacteria of the Microcystis genus can produce the toxin microcystin, and present a potential health risk in many eutrophic lakes. In this study, M. aeruginosa Strain PCC7806 was grown in semi-continuous turbidostats to investigate the effect of increasing salinity on growth rate, microcystin cell quota, microcystin production and extracellular microcystin concentration. Specific growth rate, microcystin cell quota and microcystin production remained more or less unaffected by salinity levels up to 10 g l(-1). Specific growth rate collapsed when salinity was increased beyond 10 g l(-1) for several weeks. Cell size and microcystin cell quota decreased while extracellular microcystin concentrations increased at salinities above 10 g l(-1), indicating leakage and/or cell lysis. Salt-shock experiments revealed that M aeruginosa can temporarily endure salinities as high as 17.5 g l(-1). These results indicate that, for a freshwater species, M aeruginosa has a high salt tolerance. Rising salinities in freshwater ecosystems are therefore unlikely to suppress M aeruginosa blooms, and may in fact enhance the exposure of aquatic organisms to elevated concentrations of extracellular microcystins. harmful algal blooms; harmful cyanobacteria; Microcystis; microcystins; salinity; HPLC;WATER MANAGEMENT; BLOOM; SALINITY; ESTUARY; PHYTOPLANKTON; GROWTH; LIGHT; SHRINKAGE; RESPONSES; BACTERIA","Species stratification and weather conditions drive tree growth in Scots pine and Norway spruce mixed stands along Europe Mixed forests are suggested as a strategic adaptation of forest management to climate change. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) are tree species of high economic and ecological value for European forestry. Both species coexist naturally in a large part of their distributions but there is a lack of knowledge on the ecological functioning of mixtures of these species and how to manage such stands. This paper analyses these species' intra- and inter-specific competition, including size-symmetric vs. size-asymmetric competition, and explore the effect of weather conditions on tree growth and competition. We studied basal area growth at tree level for Scots pine and Norway spruce in mixed versus pure stands in 22 triplets of fully-stocked plots along a broad range of ecological conditions across Europe. Stand inventory and increment cores provided insights into how species mixing modifies tree growth compared with neighbouring pure stands. Five different competition indices, weather variables and their interactions were included and checked in basal area growth models using a linear mixed model approach. Interspecific size-asymmetric competition strongly influenced growth for both tree species, and was modulated by weather conditions. However, species height stratification in mixed stands resulted in a greater tree basal area growth of Scots pine (10.5 em(2) year(-1)) than in pure stands (9.3 em(2) year(-1)), as this species occupies the upper canopy layer. Scots pine growth depended on temperature and drought, whereas Norway spruce growth was influenced only by drought. Interspecific site-asymmetric competition increased in cold winters for Scots pine, and decreased after a drought year for Norway spruce. Although mixtures of these species may reduce tree size for Norway spruce, our results suggest that this could be offset by faster growth in Scots pine. How inter-specific competition and weather conditions alter tree growth may have strong implications for the management of Scots pine-Norway spruce mixtures along the rotation period into the ongoing climate change scenario.

The aim of mitigating climate change is realized in many parts of the transport system, concurrently and at high pace, which brings with it many challenges for the resilience of the system. By resilience, we mean the ability of a system to adapt due to disruptions and surprises. There are numerous links between the different systems that form the transport system and the actors responsible for available choices in the system of systems need to be identified. The aim of this paper is to identify requirements for developing a method for increasing resilience in the transport system. In this study a description of the electrified goods transport system as a system of systems is developed through a combination of researchers from different areas and discussions with experts mainly in the field of transport and governance. The resulting system of systems is presented in the paper together with a list of measures that will aid the development of a resilient electrified goods transport system. The measures are divided into technology, organisation and behaviour. system-of-systems; goods transport; resilience; electrified transport;nan","Above-ground biomass dynamics after reduced-impact logging in the Eastern Amazon Changes in above-ground biomass (ACB) of 17 1 ha logged plots of terra firme rain forest in the eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas) were monitored for four years (2004-2008) after reduced-impact logging. Over the same time period, we also monitored two 0.5 ha plots in adjacent unlogged forest. While AGB in the control plots changed little over the observation period (increased on average 1.4 Mg ha(-1)), logging resulted in immediate reductions in ABG that averaged 94.5 Mg ha(-1) (+/-42.0), which represented 23% of the 410 Mg ha(-1) (+/-64.9) present just prior to harvesting. Felled trees (dbh > 55 cm) accounted for 73% (+/-15) of these immediate losses but only 18.9 Mg ha(-1) (+/-8.1) of biomass was removed in the extracted logs. During the first year after logging, the annual AGB balance (annual AGB gain by recruitment and growth - annual AGB loss by mortality) remained negative (-31.1 Mg ha(-1) year(-1); +/-16.7), mainly due to continued high mortality rates of damaged trees. During the following three years (2005-2008), average net AGB accumulation in the logged plots was 2.6 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (+/-4.6). Post-logging biomass recovery was mostly through growth (4.3 +/- 1.5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for 2004-2005 and 6.8 +/- 0.9 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for 2005-2008), particularly of large trees. In contrast, tree recruitment contributed little to the observed increases in AGB (1.1 +/- 0.6 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for 2004-2005 and 3.1 +/- 1.3 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for 2005-2008). Plots with the lowest residual basal area after logging generally continued to lose more large trees (dbh >= 70 cm), and consequently showed the greatest AGB losses and the slowest overall AGB gains. If 100% AGB recovery is desired and the 30-year minimum cutting cycle defined by Brazilian law is adhered to, current logging intensities (6 trees ha(-1)) need to be reduced by 40-50%. Such a reduction in logging intensity will reduce financial incomes to loggers, but might be compensated for by the payment of environmental services through the proposed REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

These studies are particularly valuable in the high latitudes, regions especially vulnerable to rapid climate change and increasingly used for plant-based proxy reconstructions of past hydroclimate, but also where modern vegetation is understudied compared to the lower latitudes. Here we investigate delta H-2 values from leaf wax n-alkanes of vascular tundra plants in the Kangerlussuaq area of western Greenland. We collected a variety of common tundra species to study possible interspecies variability in delta H-2 values including dwarf shrubs (Betula nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Salix glauca), forbs and graminoids (Vaccinium uliginosum, Rhododendron tomentosum, and Calamagrostis lapponica), a horsetail species (Equisetum arvense), and a submerged aquatic macrophyte from a local lake (Stuckenia filiformis). Using previously measured leaf and stem waters to help constrain potential drivers of leaf wax n-alkane delta H-2 values, we find that the overall net fractionation (epsilon(app)) from the studied species is -75 +/- 20%. The eapp at Kangerlussuaq is consistent with other studies of Arctic vegetation that find smaller eapp than from the majority of lower latitude sites. The fractionation of leaf water and xylem water (epsilon(lw/xw)) and the fractionation of xylem water and precipitation (epsilon(xw/p)) are both relatively constant, suggesting stable leaf and soil related fractionations across species. Estimates of biosynthetic fractionation (epsilon(bio)), as evidenced from the fractionation of the delta H-2 values of n-alkanes and leaf water (epsilon(wax/ lw)), are not constant across species as sometimes assumed, and are small (average of ebio is -120 +/- 27%) compared to many published estimates. This supports a significant role in ebio shaping the eapp in this high latitude setting, where lipid biosynthesis may be driving differences in n-alkane delta H-2 values. This finding suggests that lipids in the Kangerlussuaq plants studied rely on the use of some proportion of different hydrogen sources during lipid synthesis, such as stored NADPH. The cumulative results of this survey of Kangerlussuaq area n-alkane delta H-2 values and water-wax fractionations suggest that fractionation in the high latitudes during the short summer growing season may play an important role in governing the small eapp compared to many low latitude sites. Better understanding of appropriate eapp and the importance of ebio in controlling plant wax fractionation from the high latitudes is necessary for future reconstructions of hydroclimate using leaf wax delta H-2 values in these regions.

As such, heritage managers are faced with imminent preservation challenges that necessitate the consideration of place meanings during adaptation planning. This study explores how stakeholders perceive the vulnerability of the tangible aspects of cultural heritage, and how climate change impacts and adaptation strategies may alter the meanings and values that are held within those resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals with known connections to the historic buildings located within cultural landscapes on the barrier islands of Cape Lookout National Seashore in the United States (US). Our findings revealed that community members hold deep place connections, and that their cultural resource values are heavily tied to the concepts of place attachment (place identity and place dependence). Interviews revealed a general acceptance of the inevitability of climate impacts and a transition of heritage meanings from tangible resources to intangible values. Our findings suggest that in the context of climate change, it is important to consider place meanings alongside physical considerations for the planning and management of vulnerable cultural resources, affirming the need to involve community members and their intangible values into the adaptive planning for cultural resources. adaptation planning; place attachment; place identity; place dependence; sea level rise;nan","Policy capacities and effective policy design: a review Effectiveness has been understood at three levels of analysis in the scholarly study of policy design. The first is at the systemic level indicating what entails effective formulation environments or spaces making them conducive to successful design. The second reflects more program level concerns, surrounding how policy tool portfolios or mixes can be effectively constructed to address complex policy objectives. The third is a more specific instrument level, focusing on what accounts for and constitutes the effectiveness of particular types of policy tools. Undergirding these three levels of analysis are comparative research concerns that concentrate on the capacities of government and political actors to devise and implement effective designs. This paper presents a systematic review of a largely scattered yet quickly burgeoning body of knowledge in the policy sciences, which broadly asks what capacities engender effectiveness at the multiple levels of policy design? The findings bring to light lessons about design effectiveness at the level of formulation spaces, policy mixes and policy programs. Further, this review points to a future research agenda for design studies that is sensitive to the relative orders of policy capacity, temporality and complementarities between the various dimensions of policy capacity.

We investigated whether reports of physical and sexual IPV were less frequent in school jurisdictions with more affirming climates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) students; and whether these associations varied for sexual orientation subgroups. We combined student-level data from the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys on demographics and experiences with physical and sexual IPV with jurisdiction-level data from the 2014 School Health Profiles on LGBTQ-affirming school climate. Multilevel logistic regression models examined associations between LGBTQ-affirming school climates and IPV. We stratified our data by sex and examined whether these associations differed by sexual orientation subgroups using cross-level interaction terms between school climate and sexual orientation (assessed via sexual identity and behavior). Sexual minority youth were more likely to report experiencing past-year physical and sexual IPV than their heterosexual counterparts. Attending schools with more LGBTQ-affirming climates reduced the likelihood of reporting physical IPV, but not sexual IPV, for female students. More LGBTQ-affirming school climates increased risk for sexual IPV among gay male students. Establishing LGBTQ-affirming school climates may reduce physical IPV for female students, but may have unintended consequences on sexual IPV prevalence for gay male students. More work is necessary to ensure that these climates are affirming for all sexual minority students and to address sexual violence prevention.

Methods: Four highly experienced electrical utilities workers were monitored during regularly scheduled-work performed in hot conditions (similar to 34 degrees C) on two consecutive days. Worker hydration (urine specific gravity) was assessed prior to and following work. The level of physical exertion was determined by video analysis. Body core temperature (T-core) and heart rate (HR; presented as a percentage of maximum, % HRmax) were monitored continuously. Responses were reported for each worker individually and as a group mean +/- standard deviation. Results: According to current guidelines, all workers were dehydrated prior to work on both days (urine specific gravity: day 1, 1.025 +/- 0.005; day 2, 1.029 +/- 0.004) and remained dehydrated following work (urine specific gravity: day 1, 1.027 +/- 0.015; day 2, 1.032 +/- 0.004) except for one worker on day 1 (urine specific gravity of 1.005). On day 1, the proportion of the work shift spent at rest (as defined by the American Conference for Governmental and Industrial Hygienists, ACGIH) was 51 +/- 15% (range: 30-64%). Time spent resting increased in all workers on the second day reaching 66 +/- 5% (range: 60-71%) of the work shift. Work shift average T-core was 37.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C (range: 37.5-37.7 degrees C) and 37.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C (range: 37.5-37.9 degrees C) on days 1 and 2, respectively. Peak T-core surpassed the ACGIH recommended threshold limit of 38.0 degrees C for work in the heat in three workers on day 1 (38.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C, range: 37.8-38.2 degrees C) while all workers exceeded this threshold on day 2 (38.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C, range: 38.2-38.7 degrees C). By contrast, work shift average (day 1, 67 +/- 7% HRmax, range: 59-74% HRmax; day 2, 65 +/- 4% HRmax, range: 60-70% HRmax) and peak (day 1, 90 +/- 6% HRmax, range: 83-98% HRmax; day 2, 87 +/- 10% HRmax, range: 73-97% HRmax) HR were similar between days. Conclusion: This case report demonstrates elevations in thermal strain over consecutive work shifts despite decreases in work effort in electrical utilities workers during regular work in the heat.

This raises the issue of farm vulnerability during and after this conversion, i.e. the farm's ability to respond to the effects of technical, climatic and economic risks. Our objective was to show whether and how dairy farm vulnerability can decrease during and after conversion to organic farming. We surveyed a sample of 12 dairy farms in Brittany, France, from 2008 (their last year conventional) to 2013. Our method considered farm vulnerability a function of the initial level of and trend in farm self-sufficient milk productivity, economic efficiency, net profitability per worker and independence from European common agricultural policy (CAP) subsidies. We related these vulnerability variables to explanatory variables that illustrated farm exposure to climatic and economic variability and farming practices. The results show that nearly all farms improved their economic efficiency (11/12), about two thirds improved their self-sufficient milk productivity (8/12) and profitability per worker (7/12), and half improved their independence from CAP subsidies (6/12). Farms had diverse vulnerability patterns, with trade-offs between the initial situation and the trend followed during the conversion, and among vulnerability variables. We identified two main adaptation strategies: (i) pasture-based farms that were similar to organic farming models when conventional and that did not change much during the conversion, and (ii) farms based on maize and feed concentrates when conventional that drastically changed. The latter farms had the greatest decrease in vulnerability and improved their self-sufficient milk productivity, profitability per worker, economic efficiency and independence from CAP subsidies. Overall, variability in climatic and economic conditions had less influence on vulnerability than farming practices. Here, we showed for the first time that changing farming practices by converting to organic farming can be a powerful mechanism for reducing farm vulnerability.

An Assessment of Vulnerability to Coastal Erosion Coastal vulnerability and its physical, economic and social consequences at national and international scales is of high scientific, political and policy interest. Anthropogenic climate change and coastal erosion threaten the very fabric of a society. Indications, that coastal hazards are impacting diverse coastal areas severely across the world, and it is no longer a vague future threat that can't be ignored. Rising eustatic sea levels synthesized by the growing frequency and scale of coastal hazards like storm surges, coastal erosion and coastal landslides threaten low-lying and unprotected coastal areas in the United Kingdom even if they have coastal defenses. However, there is still significant uncertainty about the degree of vulnerability along different coastal stretches, particularly in England. To fill this uncertainty, the current study estimated the coastal vulnerability of the coastal erosion hotspot Camber, England, by establishing a coastal vulnerability index. This index was developed by compounding various existing parameters and termed as Erosion Coastal Vulnerability Index (ECVI). Results illustrate that 67% of coastal area fall between high and very high vulnerability categories, and current coastal defenses are not strong enough to tackle the severe coastal erosion in Camber. Within the evaluation, thematic maps were generated to enable the intensity of the vulnerability for different coastal stretches to be identified. The evaluated vulnerable hotspot should be treated urgently by regional and national policy organizations to ameliorate the impacts of coastal erosion and other associated risks. Without action, the hotspot is likely to encounter unprecedented new vulnerabilities, disasters and humanitarian catastrophes. The current study results allow for a local, regional and national comparison that may help to evaluate changes in coastal erosion vulnerability.

Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) methods are recognised approaches to navigate deep uncertainties and support robust and adaptable decisions. However, their ability to fully reflect the context in which these decisions are made has been criticised. This paper presents a synthesis across cases and methods to provide a holistic understanding of the application of DMDU methods to support long-term decision making. We carried out a structured literature review and analysed 37 infrastructure DMDU case studies. The analysis shows that DMDU methods are effective at developing plans to address a range of deep uncertainties and in some cases, reflecting the institutional context of the decision. However, they largely overlook the organisational and individual contexts in which decision making happens. We argue that the use of existing DMDU methods in practice should start with a better understanding of the institutional, organisational and individual contexts. We then suggest modifications to the applications of DMDU methods, i.e. internalising the context at different stages of the decision-making process and developing a decision typology to signpost decision makers to the best approach for a specific context. ","Research and design for thermal comfort in Dutch urban squares Human thermal comfort in urban outdoor places was generally not an issue in Dutch urban design. This neglect shows problematic effects of discomfort, but also missed chances in urban life quality. The existing problems are alleviated due to the expected effects of climate change with even higher temperatures. This altogether requires adaptations in the setup of the urban environment. But there still is a lack of usable urban design guidelines. Therefore, a ""research for design"" and a ""research by design"" project was conducted, generating design guidelines for thermally comfortable Dutch urban squares. The ""research for design"" entailed a survey on people's microclimate perceptions resulting in a range of design guidelines. These guidelines and additional new design hypotheses were applied in a design process - a ""research by design"" and tested further through microclimate simulations. These lead to improved design guidelines in the form of spatial patterns for optimized thermal comfort conditions in Dutch urban squares. The results of this project, being a range of design recommendations, facilitate the easy implementation of measures to improve thermal comfort in Dutch public squares and make cities more climate-proof.

However, their success largely depend on implementation for which several barriers exist. For NBS to be meaningful in terms of delivering positive impacts in cities, we need better understanding of how implementation is embedded in NBS frameworks. The aim of this paper is to i) understand how frameworks address implementation, and ii) extract and synthesize key elements and conditions required for enabling the implementation process. Taking a hermeneutic approach, the paper makes use of preunderstanding to interpret and analyse 'the whole' and 'the parts' of the implementation process and discuss how the discourse on NBS implementation could advance towards more operational understanding. This paper suggests that multi-stakeholder collaboration and co-creation of knowledge are important prerequisites for shared understanding of problems, developing actionable knowledge and adapting NBS to site-specific societal challenges. Advancing knowledge about the NBS implementation process is relevant for capacity building and governance of NBS at the local level and bridging policy areas, stakeholders and the knowledge needed to make NBS become relevant to broader society. However, more research is needed to i) move beyond conceptual propositions and towards operational understanding of NBS principles and ii) improve the understanding of how local collaboration and co-creation of knowledge can enhance capacity building and support implementation of NBS.

The knowledge of the flowering biology of forest trees, and thus also of Pedunculate Oak, is exceptionally important when planning to mass-produce genetically high-quality seeds at clonal seed orchards (CSO) for the purpose of reforestation and restoration of forest cultures. The production of genetically high-quality seeds at CSOs, which assumes a high degree of genetic diversity, can only be guaranteed if 20 to 60 clones of different genotypes contribute to pollination (transferring of pollen from stamen to stigma). However, for a successful fertilization, which would guarantee the desired quality and quantity of seeds, phenological synchronization of the clone flowering within CSOs is also important. The beginning of pedunculate oak bud burst is under significant genetic control, which opens up the possibility to make the right selection of plus trees, with the goal of achieving a permanent phenological synchronization of flowering and flushing of clones with which the CSOs have been established. However, the effect of poor weather, such as heavy rainfall, too high or too low relative humidity of air, low temperatures, frosts, hail, etc., can sometimes disrupt favorable phenological synchronization of clones, also lowering the quality and quantity of seeds produced. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the phenological synchronization of clone flowering within CSOs, (ii) to look into the possible effect of weather on the duration of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding, (iii) to determine the degree of correspondence between particular phenophases of flushing and flowering. The study has been conducted at the experimental field founded in the spring of 2008 within Rasadnik Brestje (Forest Administration Zagreb, Forest Office Dugo Selo). The experimental field has been founded by planting ramet in accordance with the experimental design of randomized section system with repetitions (sections). Each clone is represented with one ramet in each section. Ramets originate from the clones of pedunculate oak, from which clonal seed orchards were founded in the regions under respective Forest Administrations (FAs) Vinkovci (VK), Nasice (NA) and Bjelovar (BP. Phenological observations of flushing and flowering were performed simultaneously, twice a week, until the leaves were fully developed on all clones, i.e. until all male flowers ceased to shed pollen or until all female flowers ceased to be receptive. The phenology of flushing was monitored in accordance with the methodology which distinguishes 7 phenophases in the flushing of pedunculate oak, while the phenology of flowering was monitored according to the methodology developed on the example of cork oak (Quercus suber L.). In this study, during the phenological monitoring of flowering, special attention was given to phenophases of male flower development, which describe the beginning and the end of pollen shedding, i.e. to phenophases of female flowers, which describe the beginning and the end of their receptivity. Microclimatic conditions during flowering (from April 7 to May 23) in 2010 were measured via automatic meteorological station set up at the experimental field. From a total of 145 clones, 103 were flowering at the experimental field in 2010, 8 of which only with male flowers, 31 only with female flowers, and 63 with both male and female flowers. Protogyny was established for the clones flowering with both male and female flowers, except for the clone VK 43 where protandry was established. The receptivity of female flowers of protogynous clones occurred on average 7 days before the male flowers began shedding pollen, while the VK 43 clone started releasing pollen a day before female flowers started to be receptive. Generally speaking for all the clones represented at the experimental field and flowering in 2010, pollen shedding started on April 15, and ended on May 22. The receptivity of female flowers started on April 13, and ended on May 13. From the moment the first clone started shedding pollen untill shedding stopped, 37 days have elapsed, while the receptive period of female flowers lasted 30 days. The receptive period of female flowers for the clones in the region of FA BJ and VK started on April 14, while this period started on April 13 for the clones in the region of FA NA. The end of the receptive period for BJ clones was recorded on May 13, for NA clones on April 20, and for VK clones on May 11. The receptive period of BJ female flowers lasted for 29 days, of NA for 9 days, and of VK for 28 days. There were two ""critical"" periods (the first from April 19 to 22, and the other on May 3) during which a sudden termination of receptivity in female flowers was recorded in a great number of clones. During the first period with a more pronounced effect, the termination of receptivity occurred in almost all of the clones within all three CSOs where flowers started to be receptive before April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers in all of the clones that stopped being receptive in this period amounted to 4.2 days. In the second and less pronounced period, there was a termination of receptivity of female flowers in a half of VK clones, whose receptivity mostly began after April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers, where clones stopped being receptive after May 3, amounted to 9.2 days. Considering the duration of the receptive period of female flowers, statistically significant difference has been determined among the clones whose receptivity of female flowers ended before April 22 and the clones whose female flowers stopped being receptive after April 22. The above-mentioned critical periods occurred in both cases after a sudden drop in the relative humidity of air, which was recorded on April 19 and 29, and low values of minimum air temperatures, which were recorded on April 19, 28 and 29. Shortly before or during the occurrence of ""critical"" periods, precipitation was also recorded. The shedding of pollen started on April 19 for the clones in the region of FA BJ and NA, while the clones in the region of FA VK started shedding pollen on April 15. BJ clones stopped shedding pollen on May 20, NA clones on May 3, and VK clones on May 13. Pollen shedding lasted 31 days in BJ clones, 14 days in NA clones, and 28 days in VK clones. Similarly to the receptivity of female flowers, two ""critical"" periods, when a significant number of clones stopped shedding pollen, can also be noted (the first from April 27 to 29, and the second on May 10). During the first period, most of the NA clones stopped shedding pollen. During the second period, a sudden halt in shedding pollen was recorded in almost all VK clones that started shedding pollen after May 3. The duration of pollen shedding does not differ with respect to ""critical"" periods when cessation of shedding occurred, and it amounts to 5.6 days for all the clones, on average. The abovementioned ""critical"" periods, in both cases connected with shedding of pollen, occurred during a period with high temperatures and low relative humidity of air, without precipitation. Phenological synchronization of flowering is the result of bud-burst synchronization in clones within CSOs and weather conditions, at the moment of receptivity of female flowers and shedding of pollen. In that respect, a combination of phenological synchronization of flowering and unfavorable weather conditions, which caused the sudden termination and short receptive period of female flowers, was most drastically reflected through the clones from CSO NA. Only a smaller number of clones from CSO NA could have participated in mutual pollination in 2010, while in CSOs VK and BJ most of the clones had this opportunity thanks to the unsynchronized bud burst, which had in turn enabled a number of clones to avoid unfavorable weather conditions. Based on the comparison between an average number of days that clones needed to enter each of the studied phenophases of flushing and flowering, it has been determined that the onset of the receptive period of female flowers occurred almost at the same time with phenophase of flushing L4 (first leaves are developed still mostly in the bud), the onset of pollen shedding, and the termination of receptive period of female flowers at the same time with phenophase L6 (the leaves are formed but still longitudinally curved), while the flushing phenophase L7 (the leaves are fully formed and smooth) coincided with the termination of receptivity of female flowers. The results showed that the phenological synchronization of flowering in 2010 was significantly affected by unfavorable weather conditions, which shortened the duration of the receptive period of female flowers to a greater degree, while they had no significant effect on the duration of pollen shedding period. Such course of events most severely affected the clones originating from CSO NA, which had started the period of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding of male flowers approximately at the sonic time, in contrast to the clones originating from CSOs Vinkovci and Bjelovar, which started their receptive periods of female flowers and pollen shedding periods of male flowers at different times. pedunculate oak; clonal seed orchard; meteorological data; pollination; protogyny; receptivity;nan","Seasonal Prediction of June Rainfall over South China: Model Assessment and Statistical Downscaling The performances of various dynamical models from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Climate Center (APCC) multi-model ensemble (MME) in predicting station-scale rainfall in South China (SC) in June were evaluated. It was found that the MME mean of model hindcasts can skillfully predict the June rainfall anomaly averaged over the SC domain. This could be related to the MME's ability in capturing the observed linkages between SC rainfall and atmospheric large-scale circulation anomalies in the Indo-Pacific region. Further assessment of station-scale June rainfall prediction based on direct model output (DMO) over 97 stations in SC revealed that the MME mean outperforms each individual model. However, poor prediction abilities in some in-land and southeastern SC stations are apparent in the MME mean and in a number of models. In order to improve the performance at those stations with poor DMO prediction skill, a station-based statistical downscaling scheme was constructed and applied to the individual and MME mean hindcast runs. For several models, this scheme can outperform DMO at more than 30 stations, because it can tap into the abilities of the models in capturing the anomalous Indo-Pacific circulation to which SC rainfall is considerably sensitive. Therefore, enhanced rainfall prediction abilities in these models should make them more useful for disaster preparedness and mitigation purposes.

Palynological data obtained from pollen analyses of peat-bogs, lakes and archaeological sites, as well as radiocarbon dating, were used to infer the human impact on vegetation and landscape during the last 9 millennia. The Neolithic contribution to the configuration of landscape is scarce, limited to the valleys, while Chalcolithic settlements and their related activities (agriculture and grazing) represent the first evidence of significant human impact on the high-mountains. The pollen record has allowed us to relate two cultural periods of changing, the Copper Age-Early Bronze Age and Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age transitions, to abrupt climate disruptions, the so-called 4.2 and 2.8 ka cal BP events respectively. From the Iron Age to the Early Middle Ages, anthropic activities were still sporadic, mainly located in the lowlands, but from the Feudal Period onwards, when La Mesta transhumance system takes place, high-mountain landscapes changed dramatically. Late Modern Period brings a further intensification of human pressure, especially related to forestry, with widespread pinewood afforestation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

In the Himalaya, climate change threatens mountain water resources as glaciers melt and changes in runoff and water availability are likely to have considerable negative impacts on ecological and human systems. While much has been written on the effect of climate change on glaciers in the Himalaya and its impact on sustainability, almost nothing has been published on rock glaciers in the region and their role in maintaining water supplies as the climate warms. Rock glaciers are important components of the Himalayan hydrological system because they are present in almost all regions of the Himalaya and are climatically more resilient than other glacier types owing to an insulating layer of debris cover. Research from other mountain regions shows that they contain potentially important water stores, although in the Himalaya, there is almost no information on their number, spatial distribution and response to future climate change. The extent to which this contributes to higher resilience of the Himalayan cryosphere as a whole is still an open question. This paper argues that research into Himalayan rock glaciers that reveals their hydrological significance is critical for underpinning climate change adaptation strategies and to ensure that this highly populated region is in a strong position to meet sustainable development goals.

Lignocellulose biomass-derived biofuels and biochemicals have emerged as clean products to complement fossil-based resources and reduce environmental impacts. Lignocellulosic biomasses are renewable, inexpensive and abundantly available resources to produce a wide variety of liquid, gaseous and solid biofuels and industrially relevant biochemicals. Different biological (e.g., fermentation and anaerobic digestion), thermochemical (e.g., liquefaction, gasification and pyrolysis) and catalytic (e.g., transesterification) conversion technologies can be used to produce fuel and chemical products from lignocellulosic biomass. This article makes a comprehensive review of different biofuels (e.g., biodiesel, bio-oil, bioethanol, biobutanol, biogas, hydrogen, syngas and jetfuel) and value-added biochemicals (e.g., propylene, ethylene, benzene, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, levulinic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, phenols and other aromatic compounds) from lignocellulosic biomass. Additionally, the current status, challenges and future perspectives for the production and utilization of biofuels and biochemicals are systematically discussed. biochemicals; biofuels; biological conversion; lignocellulosic biomass; thermochemical conversion;FUMARIC-ACID PRODUCTION; SUPERCRITICAL WATER GASIFICATION; INTEGRATED CO2 CAPTURE; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SPENT COFFEE GROUNDS; FAST PYROLYSIS; WHEAT-STRAW; HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; RICE STRAW; BIO-OILS","Driving Factors and Risk Assessment of Rainstorm Waterlogging in Urban Agglomeration Areas: A Case Study of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, China Understanding the driving factors and assessing the risk of rainstorm waterlogging are crucial in the sustainable development of urban agglomerations. Few studies have focused on rainstorm waterlogging at the scale of urban agglomeration areas. We used the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China as a case study. Kernel density estimation (KDE) and spatial autocorrelation analysis were applied to study the spatial distribution characteristics of rainstorm waterlogging spots during 2013-2017. A geographical detector (GD) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) were used to discuss the driving mechanism of rainstorm waterlogging by considering eight driving factors: impervious surface ratio (ISR), mean shape index of impervious surface (Shape_MN), aggregation index of impervious surface (AI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), elevation, slope, river density, and river distance. The risk of rainstorm waterlogging was assessed using GWR based on principal component analysis (PCA). The results show that the spatial distribution of rainstorm waterlogging in the GBA has the characteristics of multicenter clustering. Land cover characteristic factors are the most important factors influencing rainstorm waterlogging in the GBA and most of the cities within the GBA. The rainstorm waterlogging density increases when ISR, Shape_MN, and AI increase, while it decreases when FVC, elevation, slope, and river distance increase. There is no obvious change rule between rainstorm waterlogging and river density. All of the driving factors enhance the impacts on rainstorm waterlogging through their interactions. The relationships between rainstorm waterlogging and the driving factors have obvious spatial differences because of the differences in the dominant factors affecting rainstorm waterlogging in different spatial positions. Furthermore, the result of the risk assessment of rainstorm waterlogging indicates that the southwest area of Guangzhou and the central area of Shenzhen have the highest risks of rainstorm waterlogging in GBA. These results may provide references for rainstorm waterlogging mitigation through urban renewal planning in urban agglomeration areas.

We develop a real options model of adaptation to climate change, capturing the different effects of gradual changes, represented by a Brownian motion process, and extreme events, represented by Poisson jumps with a hyper-exponential jump size distribution. We compare adaptation decisions under the increased frequency, severity, and tail thickness of extreme events as well as gradual changes. We find that while the adaptation incentives are higher in response to gradual changes, the probability of carrying out adaptation activities is higher in response to extreme events. The catalyst effects of extreme events become more significant when the tail distribution of the extreme events becomes heavier. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ","Quantifying the Relative Contribution of Climate and Human Impacts on Runoff Change Based on the Budyko Hypothesis and SVM Model The Wei River Basin (WRB), the largest tributary of the Yellow River in China, has experienced a noticeable decrease in annual runoff during the last 50 years. Quantifying the relative contributions of climate change and human activities on runoff changes is thus important for local water resources management and sustainable water resources utilizations. In this study, the heuristic segmentation method was first adopted to detect the change points of annual runoff at Linjiacun and Huaxian stations which lies in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, respectively. Then, the Budyko hypothesis and SVM-based model were applied to attribute the detected runoff changes to climate change and human activities. Results showed that: (1) two change points were detected for the annual runoff at the Linjiacun station (1971 and 1993), and Huaxian station (1969 and 1993); (2) based on the Budyko hypothesis, the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff changes at Linjiacun and Huaxian stations are 42.2 %, 57.8 % and 30.5 %, 69.8 %, respectively, whilst those based on the SVM-based model are 45.3 %, 54.7 % and 34.7 %, 65.3 %, respectively. The high consistence between the two approaches indicates that human activities are the dominate factor on historical runoff changes in the WRB.

Alongside this characterization we develop a policy framework to promote social sustainability, which has been the subject of much academic interest in recent years. In addition, we demonstrate that the social sustainability policies we advocate are capable of embracing environmental sustainability. Our work therefore provides a fresh perspective on sustainable development policies by emphasizing the importance of the social pillar to the policy making process. equity; redistribution; safety; social cohesion; social precautionary principle; social protection; social sustainability;ARAL SEA; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INEQUALITY; FRAGMENTATION; POVERTY; PROTECTION; CONFLICT; HEALTH; VULNERABILITY","How Should We Talk About Climate Change and Migration? This paper is a response Ferris (2020), specifically to the call for coalescence around a single term by which to talk about people migrating in response to climate change. While sympathetic to the imperative behind Ferris' (2020) call, my overall argument is to reject this proposal. Instead I argue for less of focus on what we call people migrating in response to climate change, and more of a focus on how we talk about them. To justify this, I argue that a single term is inherently reductive and likely to play upon anti-immigrant sentiment due to the need to portray 'migration as a problem'. At best this will result in a policy focus with limited capacity to address the challenge of migration in a context of climate change. At worst it will drive a policy response that is overtly counter-productive. As an alternative, I propose embracing a multitude of discourses, informed by principals that I argue will drive a humane climate agenda, and allow for a flexible approach that can account for the variety of concerns at the nexus of climate change and human migration. nan;ENVIRONMENTAL REFUGEES; ADAPTATION; RETHINKING","Is Indonesian peatland loss a cautionary tale for Peru? A two-country comparison of the magnitude and causes of tropical peatland degradation Indonesia and Peru harbor some of the largest lowland tropical peatland areas. Indonesian peatlands are subject to much greater anthropogenic activity than Peru's, including drainage, logging, agricultural conversion, and burning, resulting in high greenhouse gas and particulate emissions. To derive insights from the Indonesian experience, we explored patterns of impact in the two countries, and compared their predisposing factors. Impacts differ greatly among Indonesian regions and the Peruvian Amazon in the following order: Sumatra > Kalimantan > Papua > Peru. All impacts, except fire, are positively related to population density. Factors enhancing Indonesian peatlands' susceptibility to disturbance include peat doming that facilitates drainage, coastal location, high local population, road access, government policies permitting peatland use, lack of enforcement of protections, and dry seasons that favor extensive burning. The main factors that could reduce peatland degradation in Peru compared with Indonesia are geographic isolation from coastal population centers, more compact peatland geomorphology, lower population and road density, more peatlands in protected areas, different land tenure policies, and different climatic drivers of fire; whereas factors that could enhance peatland degradation include oil and gas development, road expansion in peatland areas, and an absence of government policies explicitly protecting peatlands. We conclude that current peatland integrity in Peru arises from a confluence of factors that has slowed development, with no absolute barriers protecting Peruvian peatlands from a similar fate to Indonesia's. If the goal is to maintain the integrity of Peruvian peatlands, government policies recognizing unique peatland functions and sensitivities will be necessary.

"2","Decision-support tools for dynamic management Spatial management is a valuable strategy to advance regional goals for nature conservation, economic development, and human health. One challenge of spatial management is navigating the prioritization of multiple features. This challenge becomes more pronounced in dynamic management scenarios, in which boundaries are flexible in space and time in response to changing biological, environmental, or socioeconomic conditions. To implement dynamic management, decision-support tools are needed to guide spatial prioritization as feature distributions shift under changing conditions. Marxan is a widely applied decision-support tool designed for static management scenarios, but its utility in dynamic management has not been evaluated. EcoCast is a new decision-support tool developed explicitly for the dynamic management of multiple features, but it lacks some of Marxan's functionality. We used a hindcast analysis to compare the capacity of these 2 tools to prioritize 4 marine species in a dynamic management scenario for fisheries sustainability. We successfully configured Marxan to operate dynamically on a daily time scale to resemble EcoCast. The relationship between EcoCast solutions and the underlying species distributions was more linear and less noisy, whereas Marxan solutions had more contrast between waters that were good and poor to fish. Neither decision-support tool clearly outperformed the other; the appropriateness of each depends on management purpose, resource-manager preference, and technological capacity of tool developers.

Les phenomenes climatiques extremes, tels que les secheresses, risquent de devenir plus frequents. Ces phenomenes sont mis en evidence dans les projections medianes du changement climatique etablies pour le bassin de Murray-Darling, en Australie. Pour comprendre les repercussions du changement climatique sur le rendement des cultures irriguees, il faut disposer d'une representation explicite des changements spatiaux qui touchent les stocks naturels (c.-a-d. l'approvisionnement en eau) et de leur variabilite temporelle (c.-a-d. les etats de la nature de la frequence de la secheresse) et assurer une gestion active des stocks de capital grace a des strategies d'attenuation et d'adaptation selon l'etat de la nature. Une variation de la frequence des secheresses entrainera une modification de l'allocation des terres et de l'eau entre les activites de production.

These changes in the contemporary fire regime are largely attributed to both changing climate and land management practices, including suppression of fires and past timber harvesting, over the last century. Fire management, including suppression and using wildfire for resource benefits, varies among federal land management agencies, yet no published studies have directly compared fire statistics between federal land management agencies in our study area. The primary response to wildfire on Forest Service areas is immediate suppression, while the National Park Service is more likely to use wildfire for resource benefits. We use fire perimeters and satellite-derived estimates of fire severity to compare fire statistics for wildfires (fire size, percentage of high-severity fire and high-severity patch size) among ecoregions, forest types, and land management agencies 1984-2009 in the Sierra Nevada, Southern Cascades, and Modoc Plateau of California, USA. High-severity patch size and percentage of high-severity fire, regardless of forest type, were less (P < 0.05) in Yosemite National Park than on Forest Service lands. Yosemite fires were smaller on average than fires on Forest Service lands on the east side of the Sierra Nevada, southern Cascades and Modoc Plateau. Depending upon whether fires that crossed boundaries were included or not, mean size of Yosemite fires was either smaller or not significantly different from Forest Service fires on the west side of the Sierra Nevada. Even under current conditions, it appears that fire management practices that emulate those used in Yosemite could moderate effects of past land management, restoring and helping to maintain old forest conditions within the greater Sierra Nevada region, including the southern Cascades and Modoc Plateau. fire effects; fire severity; fire suppression policy; Forest Service; National Park Service; RdNBR; Sierra Nevada, USA; wildfire;MIXED-CONIFER FOREST; YOSEMITE-NATIONAL-PARK; POTENTIAL FIRE BEHAVIOR; OLD-GROWTH; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; PRESCRIBED FIRE; FUEL TREATMENTS; WILDLAND FIRES; SEVERITY; LANDSCAPE","Rapidly increasing macroalgal cover not related to herbivorous fishes on Mesoamerican reefs Long-term phase shifts from coral to macroalgal dominated reef systems are well documented in the Caribbean. Although the impact of coral diseases, climate change and other factors is acknowledged, major herbivore loss through disease and overfishing is often assigned a primary role. However, direct evidence for the link between herbivore abundance, macroalgal and coral cover is sparse, particularly over broad spatial scales. In this study we use a database of coral reef surveys performed at 85 sites along the Mesoamerican Reef of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala and Honduras, to examine potential ecological links by tracking site trajectories over the period 20052014. Despite the long-term reduction of herbivory capacity reported across the Caribbean, the Mesoamerican Reef region displayed relatively low macroalgal cover at the onset of the study. Subsequently, increasing fleshy macroalgal cover was pervasive. Herbivorous fish populations were not responsible for this trend as fleshy macroalgal cover change was not correlated with initial herbivorous fish biomass or change, and the majority of sites experienced increases in macroalgae browser biomass. This contrasts the coral reef top-down herbivore control paradigm and suggests the role of external factors in making environmental conditions more favourable for algae. Increasing macroalgal cover typically suppresses ecosystem services and leads to degraded reef systems. Consequently, policy makers and local coral reef managers should reassess the focus on herbivorous fish protection and consider complementary measures such as watershed management in order to arrest this trend.

We construct four multivariate damage models for pluvial floods (caused by extreme rainfall) by differentiating on the one hand between ground floor floods and basement floods and on the other hand between damage to residential buildings and damage to housing contents. We do not only take into account the effect of flood-depth on damage, but also incorporate the effects of non-hazard indicators (building characteristics, behavioural indicators and socio-economic variables). By using a Tobit-estimation technique on identified victims of pluvial floods in Flanders (Belgium), we take into account the effect of cases of reported zero damage. Our results show that the flood depth is an important predictor of damage, but with a diverging impact between ground floor floods and basement floods. Also non-hazard indicators are important. For example being aware of the risk just before the water enters the building reduces content damage considerably, underlining the importance of warning systems and policy in this case of pluvial floods.

Water diplomacy is an innovative approach and strategic tool to resolve water issues at local and trans-boundary scales when water conflicts rise in sharing water resources. Complex water supply and sharing issues arise from the existence of multiple stakeholders such as agriculture, industry, urban and domestic users, environmental use, and others competing for scarce water. Water diplomacy may contribute to solving a variety of water conflicts and in this sense is a tool for sustainable water resources management. This paper presents a review of water diplomacy focusing on various themes such as the vitality of water as a resource, virtual water, water conflicts, international water law, and management of trans-boundary waters that are reviewed in this paper in the context of searching for cogent water diplomacy strategies. This work's findings show that conflicts about trans-boundary waters are more common in developing countries than in developed countries. The latter countries have developed trans-boundary agreements, which may serve as guidelines to developing countries in some cases. Virtual water may prevent future water conflicts by reducing water demand and water stresses and providing suitable conditions for negotiation between countries. Capacity building, training in cooperation, and negotiation are means of averting water conflicts.

Compared to other important crops, there is limited knowledge of cassava lncRNAs and their roles in abiotic stress adaptation. In this study, we performed a genome-wide study of ncRNAs in cassava, integrating genomics- and transcriptomics-based approaches. In total, 56,840 putative ncRNAs were identified, and approximately half the number were verified using expression data or previously known ncRNAs. Among these were 2229 potential novel lncRNA transcripts with unmatched sequences, 250 of which were differentially expressed in cold or drought conditions, relative to controls. We showed that lncRNAs might be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of stress-induced transcription factors (TFs) such as zinc-finger, WRKY, and nuclear factor Y gene families. These findings deepened our knowledge of cassava lncRNAs and shed light on their stress-responsive roles. lncRNA; cassava; comparative approach; cold and drought stress;LONG NONCODING RNAS; FUNCTIONAL PREDICTION; SECONDARY STRUCTURES; SALT STRESS; REGULATORS; TOLERANCE","Cost-optimal analysis and technical comparison between standard and high efficient mono-residential buildings in a warm climate The recast of EU (European Union) Directive on EPBD (Energy Performance of Buildings) requires nZEBs (nearly zero energy buildings) as the building target from 2018 onwards and the establishment of cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements in buildings. This paper presents the results of the application of a methodology to identify cost-optimal levels in new residential buildings located in a warm climate. Mono-residential buildings have been considered as virtual reference buildings in this study. Different energy efficiency measures have been selected for the envelope and the systems. A combination of technical variants has been then applied to the reference case in order to obtain several configurations to be compared in terms of primary energy consumption and global costs. The cost-optimal solution is identified assessing technical features and energy performance. Standard and high efficiency buildings are analysed to show how the selected configuration allows a decrease of primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions at the lowest cost. Results are useful for comparison with other climates and building types. They also show the feasibility of the methodology to comply with EU requirements and to support the choice of economically efficient nZEBs solutions at the design stage. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To foster private and communal conservation activities an economic incentive-based conservation program (IFC) called Socio Bosque was established. Existing analyses related to conservation strategies are mainly focused on deforestation; while degradation and the role of IFC to safeguard ecosystem services are still scarce. Further on, there is a lack of landscape-level studies taking into account potential side effects of IFC on different forest types. Therefore we assessed ecosystem services (carbon stocks, timber volume) and species richness in landscapes with and without IFC. Additionally, we evaluated potential side-effects of IFC in adjacent forest types; hypothesizing potential leakage effects of IFC. Finally, we tested if deforestation rates decreased after IFC implementation. Forest inventories were conducted in 72 plots across eight landscapes in the Ecuadorian Central Amazon with and without IFC. Plots were randomly selected within three forest types (old-growth, logged and successional forests). In each plot all individuals with a diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm were measured. Old-growth forests in general showed higher carbon stocks, timber volume and species richness, and no significant differences between old-growth forests in IFC and non-IFC landscapes were found. Logged forests had 32% less above-ground carbon (AGC) and timber volume in comparison to old-growth forests. Surprisingly, logged forests near IFC presented higher AGC stocks than logged forests in non-IFC landscapes, indicating positive side-effects of IFC. Successional forests contain 56% to 64% of AGC, total carbon and timber volume, in comparison to old-growth forests, and 82% to 87% in comparison to logged forests. Therefore, successional forests could play an important role for restoration and should receive more attention in national climate change policies. Finally, after IFC implementation deforestation rate decreased on parish level. Our study presents scientific evidence of IFC contribution to conserving ecosystem services and species richness. In addition IFC could help indirectly to reduce degradation effects attributed to logging, indicating potential compatibility of conservation aims with forest activities at a landscape level. carbon stocks; timber volume; species richness; forest integrity; Socio Bosque program;PROTECTED AREAS; TROPICAL FORESTS; ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; CARBON STOCKS; RAIN-FOREST; BIODIVERSITY; BIOMASS; IMPACT; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS","Workers and Climate Change: The Need for Academic-Industry Partnerships to Improve Agricultural Worker Health, Safety, and Wellbeing Climate change will have negative consequences for human health worldwide. Agricultural workers are especially vulnerable to the health consequences of climate change. This communication demonstrates how a Total Worker Health (R) approach is utilized to protect Guatemalan agricultural workers from the negative health effects of climate change. DrPH researchers work alongside local partners to develop, implement, and evaluate climate adaptation strategies and other interventions to improve agricultural worker health, safety, and wellbeing.

The PBUCP has gained less attention in the multi-objective framework. The Kyoto Protocol and various incentive policies have forced generation companies to consider emission minimization as an objective function while solving the PBUCP. In most of the recent studies in the literature, emissions are considered as a constraint, not as an objective function. A few studies have considered the emissions as an objective and suggested the compromised solutions of the multi-objective PBUCP. A synergy of the binary differential evolution (BDE) algorithm and a binary local search optimizer (BLSO) is proposed in the present research to solve the multi-objective PBUCP. A novel BLSO is proposed which deals with binary variables while exploiting the local search and is implemented on the commitment part of the multi-objective PBUCP. The proposed BLSO makes perturbations in the unit status based on the priority of units to refine the optimal solution searched by the BDE algorithm. The efficacy of proposed algorithms has been investigated on the small, medium and large power systems. A comparison with previously known best solutions is performed for the validation of obtained results. Computed results of proposed algorithms are dominant than the already published algorithms applied to solve the multi-objective PBUCP. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Those that do focus on broader social-ecological and psychological contexts tend to be qualitative and have not been validated at the community scale. This situation reveals a need for quantitative measurement tools for assessing community resilience to slow-moving change such as rural depopulation or climate change. Our research provides a proof of concept across two diverse contexts, New Zealand and Vermont, USA, that community resilience can be quantified and broken down into dimensions of resilience. Using mixed methods, we assessed how eight communities across two countries perceive resilience and compared their perceptions with indicators of resilience in the form of official statistics. Vermonters generally perceived their communities as more resilient than did New Zealanders, and reported different dimensions of resilience as drivers of overall perceptions of resilience. Although institutional resilience was a driver of overall resilience in both countries, social and cultural dimensions of resilience were also drivers in New Zealand, whereas economic and environmental dimensions were drivers of overall resilience in Vermont. Resilience indicators were found to be weakly related or unrelated to community perceptions of resilience. This result suggests that the proposed method for measuring resilience can be used across contexts, but that there is not one type of resilience that is the key to higher levels of overall resilience. It also suggests that the two proxy measures of resilience, i.e., community perceptions and indicators, do not provide a consistent picture of resilience, raising the question of which is a more accurate measure. community; framework; indicators; resilience; rural; thresholds;INDICATORS","Effectiveness of subsidies for the Clean Development Mechanism: Past experiences with capacity building in Africa and LDCs Given the lack of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) activities in least developed countries (LDCs), subsidies for CDM projects have been suggested as a remedy. To date, subsidies spent in the CDM context have been limited to capacity building. Donor agencies have provided close to EUR45 million for awareness raising, institutional capacity building and project development in Africa and LDCs over the last 10 years, which equals about 8% of the total CDM revenues in these countries. Per registered project, the implicit subsidy reaches almost EUR1 million. This article assesses these CDM subsidies with regard to their effectiveness in mobilizing institutional set-up and project development. Targeted capacity building programmes, such as those focused on establishing a Designated National Authority, have been successful, but project development support did not mobilize significant numbers of CDM projects in most LDCs. Donor assistance was more effective when it assisted the whole process of CDM project development and not just a part of it. Overall, capacity building subsidies are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for mobilizing CDM projects. They cannot stand in for the lack of domestic capital required to set up projects.

To learn the potential causes of water level decline, this study investigated the hydrodynamic response to bathymetric changes during three typical hydrological years by scenario simulation using Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC). The simulation results indicated that bathymetric changes resulted in a water level decrease during a low water level period. Inter-annual variation in the decrease rate implied that water level in typical dry and wet years were influenced more significantly than that in moderate hydrological years. A spatial gradient in the distribution of water level changes was also observed, which was mainly concentrated in the main channel. Water velocities also slowed down, weakly corresponding to the decrease in water level during the low water level period. Overall, bathymetric changes caused by sand mining contributed to water level and velocity variations, influencing the stability and sustainability of the lake ecosystem. This study can potentially enhance our understanding of the hydrodynamic processes in Lake Poyang and support water resource management. water level; bathymetric changes; sand mining; EFDC; Lake Poyang;YANGTZE-RIVER FLOW; POYANG LAKE; FUTURE CLIMATE; CATCHMENT; PHYTOPLANKTON; SCENARIOS; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; STREAMFLOW; FREQUENCY","Evaluation of individual and area-level factors as modifiers of the association between warm-season temperature and pediatric asthma morbidity in Atlanta, GA Introduction: Previous studies have found associations between respiratory morbidity and high temperatures; however, few studies have explored associations in potentially sensitive sub-populations. Methods: We evaluated individual and area-level factors as modifiers of the association between warm-season (May-Sept.) temperature and pediatric respiratory morbidity in Atlanta. Emergency department (ED) visit data were obtained for children, 5-18 years old, with primary diagnoses of asthma or respiratory disease (diagnoses of upper respiratory infections, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or wheeze) in 20-county Atlanta during 1993-2012. Daily maximum temperature (Tmax) was acquired from the automated surface observing station at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. Poisson generalized linear models were used to estimate rate ratios (RR) between daily Tmax and asthma or respiratory disease ED visits, controlling for time and meteorology. Tmax effects were estimated for single-day lags of 0-6 days, for 3-, 5-, and 7-day moving averages and modeled with cubic terms to allow for non-linear relationships. Effect modification by individual factors (sex, race, insurance status) and area-level socioeconomic status (SES; ZIP code levels of poverty, education, and the neighborhood deprivation index) was examined via stratification. Results: Estimated RRs for Tmax and pediatric asthma ED visits were positive and significant for lag days 1-5, with the strongest single day association observed on lag day 2 (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09) for a change in Tmax from 27 degrees C to 32 degrees C (25th to 75th percentile). For the moving average exposure periods, associations increased as moving average periods increased. We observed stronger RRs between Tmax and asthma among males compared to females, non-white children compared to white children, children with private insurance compared to children with Medicaid, and among children living in high compared to low SES areas. Associations between Tmax and respiratory disease ED visits were weak and non-significant (p-value > 0.05). Conclusions: Results suggest socio-demographic factors (race/ethnicity, insurance status, and area-level SES) may confer vulnerability to temperature-related pediatric asthma morbidity. Our findings of weaker associations among children with Medicaid compared to other health insurance types and among children living in low compared to high SES areas run counter to our belief that children from disadvantaged households or ZIP codes would be more vulnerable to the respiratory effects of temperature. The potential reasons for these unexpected results are explored in the discussion.

Recycling textile waste to other value-added products is economically feasible. To integrate recycling into the apparel waste stream, it is important to know the environmental benefit and impact of the different recycling options. This study presents the environmental performance of apparel recycling and landfill using the life cycle assessment methodology in terms of climate change, acidification, agricultural land occupation and water depletion. Landfill scenarios and recycling scenarios of post-consumer household discarded apparel waste have been developed in the context of Australia. This study finds that the landfill process of natural apparel waste contributes more environmental impact credit compared to synthetic apparel, and this is mainly credited from the power generation from landfill methane gas captured. This study also specifies that the environmental benefit from the landfill process of discarded apparel depends on the ratio of natural fibre and synthetic fibre in discarded apparel. Integration of recycling into the apparel waste stream can potentially generate environmental benefits. A recycling scenario of cleaning wipes shows the highest impact benefits, followed by cotton fibre, insulation material and polyester raw material recycling. Net impact savings of recycling depend on the avoided landfill impact and avoided virgin production impact. The results generated from this study can be useful for future policy recommendations on apparel waste management through recycling. It is clear that increased collection of apparel by recyclers can significantly reduce environmental impact. nan;Discarded apparel; environmental benefit; fibre material recycling; landfill; life cycle assessment; textile waste management; Agricultural robots; Climate change; Clothes; Environmental management; Land fill; Life cycle; Raw materials; Textiles; Water recycling; Discarded textiles; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Insulation materials; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Material recycling; Policy recommendations; Value added products; Environmental impact; environmental impact; industrial waste; landfill; life cycle analysis; recycling; textile industry; Austria; Gossypium hirsutum","Out in Front? State and Federal Regulation of Air Pollution Emissions from Oil and Gas Production Activities in the Western United States As oil and gas development increases in western states, states are responding at different speeds to protect human health and the environment. Colorado and Wyoming are recognized as having taken relatively early action to regulate air pollution emissions from oil and gas development, with Wyoming adopting its first sector-specific requirements in 1999. In contrast, New Mexico and Utah have been relatively slow to act. Furthermore, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not adopt emissions standards for most oil and gas production activities until 2012, when it relied on Colorado and Wyoming as proving grounds for control technology. The regulatory history in these four western states shows that concern about ozone nonattainment was an important driver for control requirements in Colorado and Wyoming. These two states also have a history of relatively stringent pre-construction permitting requirements for small sources. In some areas, National Environmental Policy Act requirements for cumulative impact assessment drove adoption of tighter controls to mitigate impacts of growth. Moving forward, federal emissions standards will even out control requirements for new sources across the western states. However, control efforts that go beyond the 2012 federal standards will likely be needed in ozone nonattainment areas in western Wyoming, northeastern Utah, Colorado's Front Range, and in Indian Country. Further efforts will also be needed to address greenhouse gas emissions including methane. nan;nan","Snowmaking and Climate Change Future Options for Snow Production in Tyrolean Ski Resorts Winter tourism is highly sensitive to climate change. The sufficiently studied altitudinally dependent line of natural snow reliability is losing its relevance for skilift operators in Austria, where 59% of the ski area is covered by artificial snowmaking. But the diffusion of snowmaking facilities cannot be monocausally linked to climate change, as trends in tourism, prestige, and competitive advantage are important factors. Despite the fact that snowmaking is limited by climatological factors, skilift operators trust in technical improvements and believe the future will not be as menacing as assumed by recent climate change impact studies. The aim of the present study is to define reasons for the diffusion of snowmaking systems and to determine whether snowmaking can be a viable adaptation strategy despite ongoing warming, using a simple degree-day model. Results obtained with this method of assessing technical snow reliability show that current snowmaking intensity will not be sufficient to guarantee the desired 100-day season at elevations below 1500-1600 m. Snowmaking will still be possible climatically even at lower elevations, but the required intensification of capacity will lead to significantly higher operation costs.

Two different drought indices were used; SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) which considers precipitation variation only and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) which takes into account both precipitation and evapotranspiration variations. After generating the drought indices under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of IPCC, drought frequency analyses were performed and drought risks were estimated based on the joint quantiles of drought duration and severity. As a result, significant differences of drought risk were identified between SPI-and SPEI-based drought analyses using RCP 8.5 projections; mainly, the SPEI-based drought risk increases entirely across South Korea compared with the SPI-based drought risk. The outcomes of this study would be useful to develop comprehensive drought mitigation plans to cope with future climate change. climate change; drought; evapotranspiration; frequency analysis; risk;RETURN PERIOD; SEVERITY; INDEX","Urban form resilience: A meso-scale analysis Impacted by the compounding effects of climate change and urbanization, cities are facing a panoply of risks that threaten their sustainability. Recognizing the potentially catastrophic ramifications of inaction, local governments are increasingly involved in resilience-building activities that are informed by a vast body of research related to different socio-economic, environmental, and institutional aspects of urban planning and design. However, despite its significant impacts on growth and evolution of cities, limited research exists on how urban form can enhance resilience by increasing the abilities to plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events. As a step towards filling this gap, this paper explores how meso-scale urban form elements can affect urban resilience. This is done through synthesizing theoretical and empirical evidence reported in the literature. The focus is on morphological parameters related to the following urban form elements: neighborhoods, blocks, lots, and open spaces. Results show that existing evidence is mainly related to the associations between neighborhood density, size and configuration of open spaces, and land use mix' and resilience to 'climate change impacts', 'earthquakes', 'social issues', and 'resource scarcity'. There is also considerable evidence on the association between design of blocks/lots and resilience in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and adaptability to changing circumstances. The analysis also shows that each element influences and is influenced by other elements in the urban system and different elements should not be studied in isolation and the interplay between them should be considered. Existing evidence on conflicts is mainly related to density, but measures related to other elements may also involve conflicts. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research towards improving resilience of urban form at the meso-scale.

As a nation, Australia is currently classified as food secure with the domestic production exceeding domestic consumption of most major food groups. The domestic system is almost self-sufficient in terms of nutritious plant foods, although these foods have seen steady higher price increases relative to other foods, with nutrition equity implications. However, the viability of Australia's food security sits counter to the continued presence of a stable and supportive climate. This article reviews the current state of science concerning the interface between climate change, food systems, and human health to reveal the key issues that must be addressed if Australia is to advance human health and sustainable food systems under a changing climate. climate change adaptation; food security; human health;SECURITY; EQUITY","Additional risk in extreme precipitation in China from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C global warming levels To avoid dangerous climate change impact, the Paris Agreement sets out two ambitious goals: to limit the global warming to be well below 2 degrees C and to pursue effort for the global warming to be below 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial level. As climate change risks may be region-dependent, changes in magnitude and probability of extreme precipitation over China are investigated under those two global warming levels based on simulations from the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Projects Phase 5. The focus is on the added changes due to the additional half a degree warming from 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C. Results show that regional average changes in the magnitude do not depend on the return periods with a relative increase around 7% and 11% at the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels, respectively. The additional half a degree global warming adds an additional increase in the magnitude by nearly 4%. The regional average changes in term of occurrence probabilities show dependence on the return periods, with rarer events (longer return periods) having larger increase of risk. For the 100-year historical event, the probability is projected to increase by a factor of 1.6 and 2.4 at the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels, respectively. The projected changes in extreme precipitation are independent of the RCP scenarios. (C) 2017 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

Habitat fragmentation weakens the connection between populations and is accompanied with isolation by distance (IBD) and local adaptation (isolation by adaptation, IBA), both leading to genetic divergence between populations. To understand the evolutionary potential of a population and to formulate proper conservation strategies, information on the roles of IBD and IBA in driving population divergence is critical. The putative ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa) is endangered in China due to habitat loss and fragmentation. We investigated the genetic variation in 11 Chinese Oryza rufipogon populations using 79 microsatellite loci to infer the effects of habitat fragmentation, IBD and IBA on genetic structure. Historical and current gene flows were found to be rare (m(h)=0.0002-0.0013, m(c)=0.007-0.029), indicating IBD and resulting in a high level of population divergence (F-ST=0.343). High within-population genetic variation (H-E=0.377-0.515), relatively large effective population sizes (N-e= 96-158), absence of bottlenecks and limited gene flow were found, demonstrating little impact of recent habitat fragmentation on these populations. Eleven gene-linked microsatellite loci were identified as outliers, indicating local adaptation. Hierarchical AMOVA and partial Mantel tests indicated that population divergence of Chinese O.rufipogon was significantly correlated with environmental factors, especially habitat temperature. Common garden trials detected a significant adaptive population divergence associated with latitude. Collectively, these findings imply that IBD due to historical rather than recent fragmentation, followed by local adaptation, has driven population divergence in O.rufipogon. climate change; genetic divergence; habitat fragmentation; isolation by distance; local adaptation; Oryza rufipogon; outlier loci;COMPUTER-PROGRAM; GENE FLOW; SELECTION; INFERENCE; CULTIVATION; HISTORY; CONSEQUENCES; LANDSCAPE; FREQUENCY; GENOMICS","Two-stage concession game approach for analyzing greenhouse gases emission reduction schemes Climate change imposes a huge treat on the sustainability of our environment. One of the major reasons for the increasing impacts of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, cooperative greenhouse gas emission reduction schemes with a general consensus are needed in order to reduce the impacts of climate change. Due to the strong link between greenhouse gas emission and economic development there is disagreement among countries on the designing and implementation of emission reduction plans. In this paper the authors proposed a two-stage concession game to analyze emission reduction plans and determine a balanced emission range that improves the utilities of the bargaining parties. Furthermore the game was applied to a hypothetical example. Our results from the case study indicated that even though the utilities of the bargaining parties is highly affected by emission reductions, after making concessions their utilities can be improved given their emission reductions are within in a certain desirable range. The authors hope that this article provides insights which could be useful for understanding emission reduction plans and their consequences on the negotiating parties. nan;Concession game; Cooperation; Game theory; Greenhouse gas; Pareto improvement; Emission control; Game theory; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Concession game; Cooperation; Economic development; Emission range; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gases emissions; Pareto improvements; Climate change","Linking components of vulnerability in theoretic frameworks and case studies Clarification on what is meant by 'vulnerability' continues as an unresolved problem in a world of inter-connected research fields dealing with natural hazards and of policy-makers eager for vulnerability assessments that will help in steering their decisions. This paper investigates the theoretical definitions of vulnerability components in risk-hazard and climate-change frameworks and the description of these components as operated in vulnerability assessments at the case-study level. The results point to a lower level of heterogeneity in vulnerability interpretations at the case-study level when compared to the semantically rich descriptions of vulnerability components in conceptual frameworks. Despite differences in definitions, vulnerability components such as hazard and exposure, capacities and adaptation, susceptibility and sensitivity, or susceptibility and vulnerability were made operational by the use of similar indicators and methodologies between and within the communities investigated. In order to attain a better understanding of the interdisciplinary use of the term 'vulnerability', the comparison of methodologies to assess vulnerability components at the case-study level seems essential.

However, modern breeding selection methods are mostly based on improvement of ,lite lines which have a narrow genetic base; this limits a lot the genetic pool which breeders can exploit for the production of new varieties ready to face the predicted climate changes or adaptation to new cultivation areas. The oncoming changing climatic conditions claim for the need of finding new adaptation traits to both abiotic and biotic stresses to be introduced in modern ,lite varieties. These traits are often found in landraces stored in germplasm collections. The Eurisco database reports a total of over 17,000 durum accessions, some 6,800 of which are traditional varieties and/or landraces: Besides their incontestable usefulness, their great number hampers the possibility to explore their genepool. A different approach to reduce the number of genotypes to screen for new useful traits to use in breeding programs while maintaining a good representation of the genetic background, is the constitution of a working durum wheat collection selected by mean of a single seed descent (SSD) approach so far called SSD genotypes. The working collection, accounts for over approximately 450 genotypes representative of 40 countries mainly concentrated in the Mediterranean area and Horn of Africa. The SSD genotypes were subjected to large scale SNP screening by ILLUMINA Infinium iSelect 90k wheat chip and the data were analysed to assess the heterozygosity and the genetic diversity present in the SSD population. Moreover the population was preliminary phenotyped following field growth. Both analyses give the picture of a good level of genetic variability represented in the SSD genotypes. This makes this collection a good candidate for a new ""genetool"" for durum wheat breeding and research.

A numerical model is developed to investigate how sea level rise and coastline changes may impact tides in two coastal-plain estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. Despite their different tidal characteristics, the two estuaries display similar responses to the sea level rise and shoreline management scenarios. When hypothetic sea walls are erected at the present coastline to prevent low-lying land from flooding, tidal range increases, with greater amplification in the upper part of the two estuaries. When low-lying land is allowed to become permanently inundated by higher sea level, however, tidal range in both estuaries decreases. Analyses of the tidal energy budget show that the increased dissipation over the shallow water and newly inundated areas compensates for the reduced dissipation in deep water, leading to smaller tidal range. The changes in the tidal range are not proportional to the changes in the mean sea level, indicating a nonlinear tidal response to sea level rise. The ratio of tidal range change to sea level rise varies between -0.05 and 0.1 in Chesapeake Bay and between -0.2 and 0.25 in Delaware Bay. The model results suggest a potential adaptation strategy that uses inundation over low-lying areas to reduce tidal range at up-estuary locations. Plain Language Summary Coastal inundation occurs when sea levels are higher than the normal extent of the tide. Presently, estimates of future coastal inundation due to sea level rise are made by simply adding the expected sea level rise to the present-day tides. However, tides are themselves affected by changes in water depth, thus sea level rise will change the position of high and low tide. In this study, we investigate how sea level rise will change tides in two large coastal waterways, Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. We also investigate how tides will be affected if shoreline protection measures are put in place to prevent rising sea levels from encroaching over low-lying land. We find that if no shoreline protection measures are installed, higher sea levels will reduce tides in both Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Adding shoreline protection measures however increases the tides, particularly in the upper reaches of both estuaries, where major cities are located. sea level rise; tides; coastal inundation; tidal dissipation;SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; TIDES; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; ESTUARY; FLUXES; DISSIPATION; ASYMMETRY; COAST; EAST","Numerical groundwater modelling for studying surface water- groundwater interaction and impact of reduced draft on groundwater resources in central Ganga basin Water resources in India's Indo-Gangetic plains are over-exploited and vulnerable to impacts of climate change. The unequal spatial and temporal variation of meteorological, hydrological and hydrogeological parameters has created additional challenges for field engineers and policy planners. The groundwater and surface water are extensively utilized in the middle Gangetic plain for agriculture. The primary purpose of this study is to understand the discharge and recharge processes of groundwater system using trend analysis, and surface water and groundwater interaction using groundwater modelling. A comprehensive hydrological, and hydrogeological data analysis was carried out and a numerical groundwater model was developed for Bhojpur district, Bihar, India covering 2395 km(2) geographical area, located in central Ganga basin. The groundwater level data analyses for the year 2018 revealed that depth to water level varies from 3.0 to 9.0 meter below ground level (m bgl) in the study area. The M-K test showed no significant declining trend in the groundwater level in the study area. The groundwater modelling results revealed that groundwater head is higher in the southern part of the district and the groundwater flow direction is from south-west to north-east. The groundwater head fluctuation between the monsoon and the summer seasons was observed to be 2 m, it is also witnessed that groundwater is contributing more to rivers in the monsoon season in comparison with other seasons. Impact of reduction in pumping on groundwater heads was alsoinvestigated, considering a 10% reduction in groundwater withdrawal. The results indicated an overall head rise of 2 m in the southern part and 0.2-0.5 m in the middle and northern part of the district. central Ganga; modelling; agriculture; groundwater; Bhojpur;MANN-KENDALL; TRENDS; MANAGEMENT","Body size shifts influence effects of increasing temperatures on ectotherm metabolism Aim: Warmer temperatures directly increase metabolic rates of ectotherms, but temperature also indirectly affects metabolic rates. Higher temperatures result in smaller body sizes and associated decreases in metabolic rates, and it remains unknown whether this indirect effect of temperature increase could mitigate the direct positive effect of temperature on metabolic rate. Here, we assess whether temperature-induced shifts in body size are likely to offset the direct influence of temperature on metabolic rate. Location: Global. Time period: 1940-2011. Major taxa studied: Ectotherms. Methods: We compiled literature-derived data on mass and temperature for 109 ectotherm species raised at various constant temperatures. Using an allometric equation to estimate metabolic rate from size and temperature, we determined the body masses necessary for species to maintain constant metabolic rates under increased temperatures. We also calculated and compared (a) change in metabolic rate attributable to increased temperature where body size does not change with (b) change in metabolic rate including empirical size change. Results: Warmer temperatures resulted in increased metabolic rate estimates, but this was partly offset by decreased body sizes for the majority of species. For most species, observed decreases in body size at higher temperatures were insufficient to avoid metabolic rate increases. Main conclusions: Although the indirect effect of temperature on metabolic rate via body size is not sufficient to counterbalance the direct effect, it limits the magnitude of the increase in metabolic rate. Thus, in a warming climate, ectotherms are likely to experience increases in energy use that are smaller than anticipated. Given that metabolic rates have substantial, diverse impacts on individuals, populations, and ecosystems, these indirect effects of temperature change will have complex cascading effects on ecological communities, but the impacts of increases in metabolic rate of these varying magnitudes are unknown. body size; ectotherms; indirect effects; metabolic rate; metabolic theory; physiology; warming temperatures;CLIMATE-CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL-TEMPERATURE; DEVELOPMENT RATES; GENERAL-MODEL; GROWTH; RESPONSES; MASS; DEPENDENCE; RULE; FISH","Effects of elevated [CO2] and soil temperature on photosynthetic responses of mountain maple (Acer spicatum L.) seedlings to light Predicting the future distribution of plants requires a mechanistic understanding of how plants cope with their new environmental conditions under a changed climate. We examined the effects of elevated carbon concentration ([CO2]) and elevated T-soil on the physiological responses to light of a shade-tolerant woody species, mountain maple (Acer spicatum L.). Seedlings were exposed to ambient and elevated [CO2] (392 mu mol mol(-1) vs. 784 mu mol mol(-1)), current and elevated soil temperatures (T-soil 17 vs. 22 degrees C) at high and low (100% vs. 30%) light conditions for one growing season. It was found that elevated T-soil stimulated net photosynthesis (A) by 18% in the low-light treatment but tended to reduce A in the high-light treatment. Elevated [CO2] increased A by 100% under the elevated T-soil and by 48% at the current T-soil. The effect of elevated T-soil also varied with [CO2]: it increased A by 13% under the elevated [CO2] but reduced A by 17% under the ambient [CO2]. We observed a significant increase in the instantaneous water-use efficiency of photosynthesis (IWUE) in response to the high-light treatment under the elevated [CO2] but not under the ambient [CO2]. Our data indicate that the elevated [CO2] markedly increased nitrogen (N) allocation to the photochemical apparatus of A in seedlings grown under the high-light condition. These results suggest that the predicted increases in atmospheric [CO2] will likely, enhance the growth of mountain maple in canopy gaps in the forest, while the predicted elevated T-soil will negate the benefit of high-light conditions.

The present study has detected trends in annual and cropping seasonal rainfall and temperature data for the period of 1961-2011 using Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Spearman's rho (SR) test and modified Mann-Kendall test that has been applied to the significant lag-1 serial correlated time series data, and slope has been estimated using Sen's Slope estimator for twelve meteorological stations located in the western part of Bangladesh covering about 41 % of the country. Almost 71 % trends explored by MK test in annual rainfall are statistically insignificant, and SR test also complies it. The spatial distribution of rainfall trend shows insignificant positive trends in major part of the area. Significant positive trends both by MK test and by SR test at 95 % confidence levels are observed at rates of 8.56, 11.15 and 13.66 mm/year at Dinajpur, Rangpur and Khepupara stations, respectively, and the Kharif season rainfall of these stations also shows significant increasing trends except Dinajpur. On the other hand, significant decreasing trends in annual rainfall are found at Bhola (-11.67 mm/year) and Rajshahi (-5.951 mm/year) stations and decreasing trends in rainfall dominated the Pre-Kharif season over the area. But, 83.33 % of the stations show rising trends in annual mean temperature with significant positive trends (as observed by both MK test and SR test) at Rangpur, Bogra, Faridpur, Jessore and Bhola stations where the rate of changes vary from 0.013 C/year at Faridpur to 0.08 C/year at Bhola. Most of the trends in Rabi and Pre-Kharif seasons of mean temperatures are not statistically significant. However, all stations except Barisal show significant rising trends in temperature in Kharif season. To cope with this changing pattern of rainfall and temperature, effective adaptation strategies should be taken to keep up the agricultural production that is related to livelihood of the most people and to ensure the country's food security. nan;Western part of Bangladesh","External sources of clean technology: Evidence from the Clean Development Mechanism New technology is fundamental to sustainable development. However, inventors from industrialized countries often refuse technology transfer because they worry about reverse-engineering. When can clean technology transfer succeed? We develop a formal model of the political economy of North-South technology transfer. According to the model, technology transfer is possible if (1) the technology in focus has limited global commercial potential or (2) the host developing country does not have the capacity to absorb new technologies for commercial use. If both conditions fail, inventors from industrialized countries worry about the adverse competitiveness effects of reverse-engineering, so technology transfer fails. Data analysis of technology transfer in 4,894 projects implemented under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism during the 2004-2010 period provides evidence in support of the model. ","Insuring large stakes: A normative and descriptive analysis of households' flood insurance coverage Households' insurance coverage against severe losses is central to their financial resilience. Features of the US National Flood Insurance Program offer insights into consumers' coverage over large stakes that are not typically possible in other markets. We examine the coverage limits (the amount of a home's value that is insured) of over 100,000 households. We determine the optimal coverage based on a standard expected utility calibration. This model indicates that consumers should purchase a low limit and retain much of their exposure due to the high premium loads in our sample. Instead, households in the sample typically fully insure their homes, paying premiums well above their contract's expected value. We investigate possible explanations for homeowners' coverage limits and conclude that some combination of industry practices that emphasize fully insuring and probability distortions in decision-making are likely explanations. ","Adoption Drivers of Improved Open-Pollinated (OPVs) Maize Varieties by Smallholder Farmers in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa This study assesses the determinants of adoption drivers of improved open-pollinated (OPVs) maize varieties by smallholder farmers in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Cross-sectional data of multi-stage random sampling was used to randomly select 150 smallholder farmers in the province. Data collection was conducted through a well-structured questionnaire administered to 150 smallholder farmers. Descriptive statistics and a logistic regression model were used for the analyses. The inferential results reveal that the majority of farmers in the study area were females (70%) with an average age of 45 years and had six people in the households. Smallholder maize farmers spent an average of 10 years in school. The results show that smallholder maize farmers had a farm size of 3 ha and a household income of R 3565.00, which contributes highly to household and farm operations. Farmers had access to extension services and were members of farm organizations. The results show that hybrid is the most used maize variety rather than OPVs. The main reason, among other things, for the poor use and adoption of OPVs is the lack of knowledge about the seeds. The results drawn from the estimations show that socio-economic and institutional factors influenced the adoption of OPVs by farmers in the study area. Therefore, the study recommends strengthening the existing extension services to highlight the benefits of OPVs through training and farmers' information days. adoption; Eastern Cape Province; open-pollinated variety (OPVs); smallholder farmers;CLIMATE-CHANGE; DETERMINANTS; ADAPTATION; EXTENSION; DROUGHT; PUNJAB","Just ten percent of the global terrestrial protected area network is structurally connected via intact land Land free of direct anthropogenic disturbance is considered essential for achieving biodiversity conservation outcomes but is rapidly eroding. In response, many nations are increasing their protected area (PA) estates, but little consideration is given to the context of the surrounding landscape. This is despite the fact that structural connectivity between PAs is critical in a changing climate and mandated by international conservation targets. Using a high-resolution assessment of human pressure, we show that while -40% of the terrestrial planet is intact, only 9.7% of Earth's terrestrial protected network can be considered structurally connected. On average, 11% of each country or territory's PA estate can be considered connected. As the global community commits to bolder action on abating biodiversity loss, placement of future PAs will be critical, as will an increased focus on landscape-scale habitat retention and restoration efforts to ensure those important areas set aside for conservation outcomes will remain (or become) connected. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; HABITAT AVAILABILITY; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; SHORTFALLS; TARGETS; SYSTEM; FUTURE; WILD","Activation of Secondary Metabolism in Citrus Plants Is Associated to Sensitivity to Combined Drought and High Temperatures Drought and heat stresses are two of the most frequent environmental factors that take place simultaneously in the field constraining global crop productivity. Metabolism reconfiguration is often behind the adaptation of plants to adverse environmental conditions. Carrizo citrange and Cleopatra mandarin, two citrus genotypes with contrasting ability to tolerate combined heat and drought conditions, showed different metabolite patterns. Increased levels of phenylpropanoid metabolites were observed in Cleopatra in response to stress, including scopolin, a metabolite involved in defense mechanisms. Tolerant Carrizo accumulated sinapic acid and sinapoyl aldehyde, direct precursors of lignins. Finally, Cleopatra showed an accumulation of flavonols and glycosylated and polymethoxylated flavones such as tangeritin. The activation of flavonoid biosynthesis in Cleopatra could be aimed to mitigate the higher oxidative damage observed in this genotype. In general, limonoids were more severely altered in Cleopatra than in Carrizo in response to stress imposition. To conclude, all metabolite changes observed in Cleopatra suggest the activation of energy metabolism along with metabolic pathways leading to the accumulation of photoprotective and antioxidant secondary metabolites, oriented to mitigate the damaging effects of stress. Conversely, the higher ability of Carrizo to retain a high photosynthetic activity and to cope with oxidative stress allowed the maintenance of the metabolic activity and prevented the accumulation of antioxidant metabolites.

Not enough is known, however, about how barriers converge in localities, what drives them and how they interact to affect adaptation processes and outcomes. This paper considers the barriers to adaptation in Namibia through the lens of the 'adaptation activity space' - a framework that positions the adapting system in relation to its environment. In doing so, it questions not only what types of barriers are encountered, but what their underlying drivers are and how the relationships among them influence adaptation on the ground. Two intersecting 'avenues' within Namibia's adaptation activity space are explored, namely: (1) the policy-practice partition and (2) the adaptive capacity challenge. Each of these avenues tells a story about the complex nature of barriers and points to the need for greater integration between government spheres, across temporal scales and among actor groups. Such integration is necessary for addressing the barriers to adaptation and for paving the way to a more effective and sustainable adaptation activity space in Namibia. adaptation; adaptation activity space; Climate change; intersecting barriers; Namibia;nan","Spatial variation of soil properties and carbon under different land use types on the Chinese Loess Plateau Land-use affects soil properties and soil carbon storage. Fully understanding land-use impacts on soil is essential to predicting effects on soils from climate change, and providing a scientific basis for soil management. Here, we measured soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and total carbon (TC) from 202 samples from cropland, forestland, and grassland, to a depth of 500 cm on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). We find that grassland and cropland have the highest clay and silt content, and have a significantly higher soil moisture capacity than forestland. Soil moisture in forestland is scarce at depths of 100-300 cm, and does not benefit from rainfall infiltration. At the same time, the soil carbon content and stocks in grassland are not significantly different from forestland. We suggest that in the light of climate change and water shortages on the CLP, grassland is more suitable than forestland or cropland to optimize carbon fixation, and prevent soil erosion. Hence the cultivation of grass should be considered as a strategy for sustainable ecosystem management on the CLP. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mobility hubs also help to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing private vehicle usage and giving equal priority to all modes of travel, including walking, cycling and other active forms of transport, i.e. public transport, ridesharing, taxis and private motor vehicles. Thus, emerging and inspiring the usage of diverse modes of transportation with less influence on the environment is one of the main policy to decrease people's environmental footprint. Since the locations of mobility hubs play an important role to achieve this goal by attracting travelers and encouraging people to use different modes of mobility options that has less impact on environment, the location selection of such hubs requires a strategic decision for authorities and policy makers. With this motivation, in this study, an integrated fuzzy multi criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that consists of interval type-2 fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and interval type-2 fuzzy Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) is proposed to select the best location for a new mobility hub location in the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Among alternative locations Kadiko & BULL;y is found as the best location for building a mobility hub to expand shared-use mobility and public transport options at a major transit station for Istanbulers in Anatolian side.

However, in many countries the society faces the threat of multiple hazards. Building-level DRR measures that aim to decrease earthquake vulnerability can have opposing or conflicting effects on flood vulnerability, and vice versa. In a case study of Afghanistan, we calculate the risk of floods and earthquakes, in terms of average annual losses (AAL), in the current situation. Next, we develop two DRR scenarios, where building-level measures to reduce flood and earthquake risk are implemented. We use this to identify districts for which DRR measures of one hazard increase the risk of another hazard. We then also calculate the optimal situation between the two scenarios by, for each district, selecting the DRR scenario for which the AAL as a ratio of the total exposure is lowest. Finally, we assess the sensitivity of the total risk to each scenario. The optimal measure differs spatially throughout Afghanistan, but in most districts it is more beneficial to take flood DRR measures. However, in the districts where it is more beneficial to take earthquake measures, the reduction in risk is considerable (up to 40%, while flood DRR measures lead to a reduction in risk by 16% in individual districts). The introduction of asynergies between DRR measures in risk analyses allows policy-makers to spatially differentiate building codes and other building-level DRR measures to address the most prevalent risk while not compromising the risk resulting from other hazards. asynergies; building back better; DRR Measures; multi-hazard risk assessment; sustainable development;MULTI-HAZARD RISK; NATURAL HAZARDS; GLOBAL EXPOSURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BUILDING BACK; VULNERABILITY; URBAN; IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK","Morphology, sedimentology and stratigraphy of Korean tidal flats - Implications for future coastal managements Tidal flats constitute a unique and extensive depositional system encompassing the entire west coast of Korea. Tidal flats are classified into three types on the basis of morphologic setting, open-coast, embayment, and channel-margin. Macrotidal regime and highly indented coastlines favored tidal current-induced sedimentation, resulting in seaward coarsening sediment distribution. Tide-dominated sedimentary processes are complicated by the strong monsoonal climate, and associated seasonal wave activity and precipitation-induced discharge. Different exposure to wave activity leads to contrasting sedimentary processes, sedimentation and morphologic response among various types of tidal flats. Summertime heavy rainfalls accentuate runoff discharge-driven sedimentation in the tidal flats, irrespective of the presence of rivers. Tidal flats have been venue for government-driven mega reclamation projects such as Saemankeum, Sihwa, and Youngjong Yongyou islands due to their geographic proximity to urban area and flat morphology. Massive destruction of tidal flats was justified by mandatory environmental impact assessments that failed to predict irreversible effects on coastal depositional system, triggering a nationwide controversy. Future reclamation projects must be supplemented by studies that can evaluate properly the complexity and dynamic behavior of tidal flats so as to minimize socio-economic cost as well as the loss of tidal flats. ","Inuit Methods of Identifying Polar Bear Characteristics: Potential for Inuit Inclusion in Polar Bear Surveys As a result of their close proximity to and frequent interactions with polar bears, Inuit hunters are aware of changes in polar bear population ecology and characteristics. This valuable information could contribute to any polar bear research or monitoring program. Understanding how Inuit gather ecological information on polar bears and how this knowledge is shaped by individual experiences can also overcome any barriers to Inuit inclusion in bear monitoring and management. On the basis of interviews in four Nunavut communities, we report Inuit hunting experiences and methods of identifying polar bear sex, age, body size, and health status. Across communities, Inuit share techniques in identifying and distinguishing bear characteristics that overlap with scientific methods, suggesting that Inuit could provide immediate and inexpensive information to polar bear research programs. Hunting preferences are shaped by individual experiences with polar bears (e.g., through hunting or bear encounters), as well as familiarity with polar bear research and management. Identifying and incorporating community perspectives in management will be necessary to sustain local support for programs that affect Inuit knowledge formation and persistence.

The resulting shifts in human exposure may influence public health. Changes can be anticipated because of altered outdoor pollution and also owing to changes in buildings effected in response to changing climate. Three classes of factors govern indoor pollutant levels in occupied spaces: (a) properties of pollutants; (b) building factors, such as the ventilation rate; and (c) occupant behavior. Diversity of indoor conditions influences the public health significance of climate change. Potentially vulnerable subpopulations include not only the young and the infirm but also those who lack resources to respond effectively to changing conditions. Indoor air pollutant levels reflect the sum of contributions from indoor sources and from outdoor pollutants that enter with ventilation air. Pollutant classes with important indoor sources include the byproducts of combustion, radon, and volatile and semivolatile organic compounds. Outdoor pollutants of special concern include particulate matter and ozone. To ensure good indoor air quality it is important first to avoid high indoor emission rates for all pollutants and second to ensure adequate ventilation. A third factor is the use of air filtration or air cleaning to achieve further improvements where warranted. adaptation; air pollution; buildings; carbon monoxide; carbon dioxide; combustion; environmental tobacco smoke; exposure; health; mitigation; ozone; particulate matter; radon; ventilation;ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE; ULTRAFINE PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS; VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; MONOXIDE-RELATED DEATHS; SHORT-TERM MORTALITY; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; PARTICULATE MATTER; PERSONAL EXPOSURE; UNITED-STATES","Working on learning: how the institutional rules of environmental governance matter Learning among actors engaged in environmental governance can be a critical pathway toward institutional change. Learning, however, is often unintentional or idiosyncratic in environmental governance. This paper considers how the rules structuring an environmental governance process can enable or constrain the institutional work of learning. We draw insights from theories of learning and from the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework's rule typology to identify how particular types of rules matter in learning. We examine how these insights can help uncover lessons from five empirical studies of learning in the environmental governance literature. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our analysis for devising rules of environmental governance to intentionally foster learning. learning; governance; institutional work; institutional change; environment;CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; NATURAL-RESOURCE; WATER GOVERNANCE; ADAPTIVE COMANAGEMENT; COLLECTIVE ACTION; KNOWLEDGE; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; TRANSFORMATION; CHALLENGE","COSTS AND BENEFITS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN SWITZERLAND Understanding the economic magnitude of climate change (CC) impacts is a prerequisite for developing adequate adaptation strategies. In Switzerland, despite new climate scenarios and impact studies, only few impacts have been monetized. Our objective is to assess costs and opportunities of CC for Switzerland by 2060, while enhancing the assessment methods. Using inputs from bottom-up impact studies, we simulate the economic consequences of climate scenarios in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework. We cover health, buildings/infrastructure, energy, water, agriculture, tourism, the spill-overs to other sectors, and international effects. Due to data constraints, significant impacts have not been quantified, e.g., for heat waves and droughts more extreme than the 2060 average climate. For the considered impacts, welfare decreases by 0.37% to 1.37% in 2060 relative to a reference without CC. Higher summer temperatures increase mortality and decrease productivity. Contrariwise, tourism benefits from extended summer seasons. Regarding energy, increased demand for cooling is overcompensated by savings in heating. ","Global effects of different types of land use and land cover changes on near-surface air temperature Understanding the climate effect of land use and land cover change (LULCC) is critical for guiding human ac-tivities towards environmental sustainability. Previous studies have reported the climate effects of global deforestation, vegetation greening and crop cultivation changes. However, the contribution of each type of land state, land transition and land management to LULCC's climate effects remain underexamined. In this study, we estimated global biophysical temperature effects of LULCC using CMIP6 climate models, with special attention on the relative contribution (RC) of 12 land state changes, 113 land transitions and 10 land managements. The results show a large difference in the simulated LULCC's temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL, and the two models even disagree in the sign of LULCC's effects in most of northern hemisphere except for autumn. Based on the weighted mean of two models, we found that historical LULCC has exerted a global warming effect at a rate of 0.0025 degrees C/century, with the largest warming effect in autumn. Spatially, a significant (p < 0.05) cooling effect is found from 60<degrees>N to 40 degrees N, while the warming trend dominates the areas from 40 degrees N to 30 degrees S. Based on regression modelling, historical changes in forested/non-forested secondary land, urban land and cropland have contributed over 70% to LULCC's temperature effect, with land transitions from secondary land to cropland and from cropland to urban land dominating the climate effect at global scale. For land management, the climate effect of irrigation is larger than that of nitrogen fertilizer application. Furthermore, the application of nitrogen fertilizer for C3 plant has larger impacts compared to C4 plants, while similar effects of irrigation are observed for different types of croplands. Besides, the large difference in temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL may be the difference in the forestland and cropland changes. Our study calls for explicit ex-amination of the climate effect induced by different types of land state-change, land transition and land man-agement for developing targeted land use policies in the future.

Rapid urbanization and the impacts of climate change have resulted in increased vulnerabilities in cities. On the other hand, the increasing proliferation of connected devices and distributed monitoring of the environment around us has opened up an opportunity to transform the way we create and manage cities. Contextual evidence of performance, outcome and efficiency can now be readily collected at a higher resolution to aid multi-disciplinary and multi-objective decision-making, enabling optimal evolution of cities against the backdrop of constrained resources and intensified vulnerabilities. This paper first argues that distributed and ubiquitous monitoring is at the heart of smart cities. Insights can be inferred from the gathered data with potential for evidence-based decisions at the required spatial and temporal scales. The paper then discusses the development of a comprehensive but concise frameworks called DICES (data, insights, citizen, evidence and standards) for conceptualizing smart cities. The dimensions of DICES are then translated into a process oriented methodology called SMART (specify, monitor, analyze, resolve and transform) by formalizing key aspects of the smart city process. Generality and scalability of DICES and SMART are demonstrated through the development of REPRO, a risk-and evidence-based platform for resilient and optimal design of buildings and infrastructure in a smart city. nan;Adaptable Services; Data-centric approach; DICES; Resilience; SMART; Smart city; Smart city methodology; Decision making; Adaptable Services; Data-centric approaches; DICES; Resilience; SMART; Smart cities; Climate change","Tactical problems with strategic consequences: A case study of how petroleum hydrocarbon suppliers support compliance and reduce risks in the minerals sector While there are tactical problems arising from using petroleum hydrocarbons, the strategic issues are considerably more material for the mining sector and society more broadly through their contribution to climate change. The supplied petroleum hydrocarbon life-cycle for refined products is a framework that enables structured engagement between supplier and customer on a range of sustainable development issues because it is an example of an input into the mining industry that affects the entire mining and minerals processing value chain. To support a transition to alternative energy sources on mine, mining and minerals processing companies are seizing the opportunity that petroleum hydrocarbon suppliers offer to their own businesses by engaging with them proactively. This study reports a case study of a mining company in eastern Australia that engaged with its petroleum hydrocarbon supplier using an engagement process based on human-centred design. The results illustrated the use of a human-centred design approach to supply chain engagement which re-oriented the supplier to take increased responsibility for fuel and lubricants impacts at the mine, and find alternative energy solutions. This study is an example of how industry self-regulation can be harnessed to drive incremental change at an operational level in the mining sector. In conclusion, the mining operation harnessed an existing supplier relationship to raise challenges posed by sourcing hydrocarbons, and to secure commitments from the supplier to improve their environmental performance in relation to supplied fuels and lubricants. Recommendations arising are for mining companies to capitalise on existing relationships with hydrocarbon suppliers to drive greater shared ownership of liabilities, as well as leveraging supplier capability to secure sustainable energy sources for mining operations. The case study illustrates the value of the time investment with proactive supplier engagement.

For the British Isles, an island group on the north-western coast of continental Europe consisting of the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland, physical separation offers a barrier to the introduction of many of the pathogens that affect animals on the rest of the continent. Added to this are strict biosecurity rules at ports of entry and the depauperate vector biodiversity found on the islands. Nevertheless, there are some indigenous arthropod-borne pathogens that cause sporadic outbreaks, such as the tick-borne louping ill virus, found almost exclusively in the British Isles, and a range of piroplasmid infections that are poorly characterized. These provide an ongoing source of infection whose emergence can be unpredictable. In addition, the risk remains for future introductions of both exotic vectors and the pathogens they harbor, and can transmit. Current factors that are driving the increases of both disease transmission and the risk of emergence include marked changes to the climate in the British Isles that have increased summer and winter temperatures, and extended the period over which arthropods are active. There have also been dramatic increases in the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile and Usutu viruses in mainland Europe that are making the introduction of these pathogens through bird migration increasingly feasible. In addition, the establishment of midge-borne bluetongue virus in the near continent has increased the risk of wind-borne introduction of infected midges and the inadvertent importation of infected cattle. Arguably the greatest risk is associated with the continual increase in the movement of people, pets and trade into the UK. This, in particular, is driving the introduction of invasive arthropod species that either bring disease-causing pathogens, or are known competent vectors, that increase the risk of disease transmission if introduced. The following review documents the current pathogen threats to animals transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and midges. This includes both indigenous and exotic pathogens to the UK.

This assumes that knowledge and governance are separate and gives knowledge co-production the appearance of playing an informative and facilitative role in global environmental change governance. But seeking Indigenous knowledge to inform environmental decision-making implies that Indigenous peoples are stakeholders as opposed to self-determining nations with rights and responsibilities regarding their knowledge systems and lands. Indigenous sovereignty is not respected when knowledge is treated as mere data for collective decision-making. This paper brings literatures on knowledge co-production together with Indigenous knowledge, research, and environmental governance to explain why co-production scholars must move away from seeking to better 'integrate' Indigenous knowledges into western science and make way for Indigenous research leadership. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE; SETTLER COLONIALISM; GOVERNANCE; SYSTEMS; WEATHER; SCIENCE","Critical oxygen levels and metabolic suppression in oceanic oxygen minimum zones The survival of oceanic organisms in oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) depends on their total oxygen demand and the capacities for oxygen extraction and transport, anaerobic ATP production and metabolic suppression. Anaerobic metabolism and metabolic suppression are required for daytime forays into the most extreme OMZs. Critical oxygen partial pressures are, within a range, evolved to match the minimum oxygen level to which a species is exposed. This fact demands that low oxygen habitats be defined by the biological response to low oxygen rather than by some arbitrary oxygen concentration. A broad comparative analysis of oxygen tolerance facilitates the identification of two oxygen thresholds that may prove useful for policy makers as OMZs expand due to climate change. Between these thresholds, specific physiological adaptations to low oxygen are required of virtually all species. The lower threshold represents a limit to evolved oxygen extraction capacity. Climate change that pushes oxygen concentrations below the lower threshold (similar to 0.8. kPa) will certainly result in a transition from an ecosystem dominated by a diverse midwater fauna to one dominated by diel migrant biota that must return to surface waters at night. Animal physiology and, in particular, the response of animals to expanding hypoxia, is a critical, but understudied, component of biogeochemical cycles and oceanic ecology. Here, I discuss the definition of hypoxia and critical oxygen levels, review adaptations of animals to OMZs and discuss the capacity for, and prevalence of, metabolic suppression as a response to temporary residence in OMZs and the possible consequences of climate change on OMZ ecology.

This study assesses farmers' local knowledge of shade trees at two locations in Ghana with different climatic conditions and vulnerability to climate change. Akumadan is located in the northern dry part of the cocoa belt representing marginal conditions for cocoa cultivation, whereas Asankragua is located in the southern wet part, more ecologically favorable for cocoa cultivation. Inventories were conducted to assess the abundance of species, their structural characteristics and benefits to cocoa systems. Results show that cocoa farmers have detailed knowledge on the functions of shade trees in cocoa systems and prefer species that provide specific needs according to the location. However, abundance of species in a location does not necessary translate into beneficial impacts on cocoa productivity. In the drier part of the cocoa belt, income diversification through shade trees is an adaptation strategy to the increasingly marginal conditions for cocoa production, which has led to the high proportion of fruit trees among the most abundant species. In contrast, farmers in the southern part of the cocoa belt select shade trees for their high cocoa compatibility. Adaptation strategies for cocoa farmers should therefore promote species that best accommodate farmers' economic, agronomic and environmental needs.

Restoration of forests within landscapes offers multiple social, economic, and environmental benefits that enhance lives of local people, mitigate effects of climate change, increase food security, and safeguard soil and water resources. Despite rapidly growing knowledge regarding the extent and feasibility of natural regeneration and the environmental and economic benefits of naturally regenerating forests in the tropics, tree planting remains the major focus of restoration programs. Natural regeneration is often ignored as a viable land-use option. Here, we assemble a set of 16 original papers that provide an overview of the ecological, economic, and social dimensions of forest and landscape restoration (FLR), a relatively new approach to forest restoration that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. The papers describe how spontaneous (passive) and assisted natural regeneration can contribute to achieving multiple social and ecological benefits. Forest and landscape restoration is centered on the people who live and work in the landscape and whose livelihoods will benefit and diversify through restoration activities inside and outside of farms. Given the scale of degraded forestland and the need to mitigate climate change and meet human development needs in the tropics, harnessing the potential of natural regeneration will play an essential role in achieving the ambitious goals that motivate global restoration initiatives.

Based on the high-emission scenarios like RCP8.5, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report suggests a wetter Indian summer monsoon (ISM) by the end of 21st century. Although the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) ISM precipitation under RCP2.6 and SSP1-2.6 is still projected to increase over 2050-2099 referenced to 1900-1949, the intermodel spread of the ISM precipitation change is tremendous in both CMIPs. Indeed, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ISM precipitation change, defined as the MME divided by its intermodel standard deviation, is even below 1 under the low-emission scenarios. This casts doubts on a future wetter ISM in a warmer climate. Moisture budget analyses further show that most of the model uncertainty in ISM precipitation change is caused by its dynamical component from the atmospheric circulation change. As expected, the interhemispheric surface warming contrast is essential in causing the intermodel differences in ISM circulation and precipitation changes under low-emission scenarios. In addition, the projected wetter ISM is prominently enhanced from CMIP5 to CMIP6, along with reduced model uncertainty. However, the resultant increased SNR in CMIP6 is still low in most ISM regions.

However, studies sufficiently clarifying the dynamics of hydrological processes in relation to irrigation return flow are scarce. In this study, HYDRUS-2D/3D model was used to analyze four irrigation development scenarios in Aksu River Basin, a major tributary of Tarim River. The study determined the effect of agricultural water saving on the dynamics of irrigation return flow in the basin. The results showed that for the 1990s, the irrigation return flow coefficient for flood irrigation was 0.50. This suggested that 50% of the water used in irrigation returned as discharge in the lower reaches. With increasing water scarcity, irrigation amount dropped while drip irrigation with plastic mulch was intensified. Accordingly, the irrigation return flow coefficient dropped from 0.44 in the 2000s to 0.34 in the 2010s under flood irrigation and from 0.42 to 0.23 under drip irrigation. With the drastic drop, irrigation was no longer enough to stabilize soil salinity in the region. The recent irrigation plan requires further reduction in irrigation amount. Based on the projected effects of the new irrigation scheme on soil salt build-up, an optimized irrigation scheme showed that the irrigation return flow coefficient should remain at 0.25. And with the use of water-saving technology, irrigation return flow has dropped from 594.01 mm in the 1990s to 164.62 mm in the 2010s, which should be maintained at 186.37 mm for the sustainability of the optimized irrigation scheme. The study also suggested that salinity was increasing in the downstream water systems due to irrigation return flow from land reclamation and water saving. This was a potential threat to the fragile riparian ecosystems in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In many cases, however, individual studies as well as reviews and global assessments, generalise small islands as a whole-often with a strong focus on Small Island Developing States (SIDS)-and lack a thorough understanding of island specificity, relationality, and context dependency. Looking at small islands' issues beyond SIDS implies the recognition of topics such as asymmetrical governance structures, archipelagic centre-periphery relationships, as well as intra- and inter-island movements in various types of island territories and geographies worldwide. This special thematic section of Island Studies Journal features contributions from the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific Ocean, and Caribbean dealing with the locally specific challenges and opportunities of adaptation to environmental and climate change. adaptation; climate change; mitigation; small islands; sustainability; vulnerability;CLIMATE; ADAPTATION; THINKING","Rainfall-Induced Shallow Landslide Detachment, Transit and Runout Susceptibility Mapping by Integrating Machine Learning Techniques and GIS-Based Approaches Rainfall-induced shallow landslides represent a serious threat in hilly and mountain areas around the world. The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the ""reach angle"" method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. shallow landslides; susceptibility mapping; machine learning; runout modeling; GIS-based approach; reach angle; Cinque Terre National Park;TERRE NATIONAL-PARK; DEBRIS FLOW; CINQUE TERRE; LAND-USE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; MITIGATION MEASURES; INTENSE RAINFALL; CAMPANIA REGION; OCTOBER 2011","Water savings and reduction of costs through the use of a dual water supply system in a sports facility In sustainable urban management, rainwater, greywater, and groundwater are increasingly being considered as alternative water sources where quality drinking water is not required for the water supply. Current technological solutions allow for the use of dual water supply systems in both private and public buildings. The latter, due to the potential to better manage an alternative water source in a sustainable manner, are recommended for larger scale use. In this article, the function of a dual water supply system operating in a sports facility, including the collection and use of rainwater for non-potable purposes, was evaluated on the basis of technical, quantitative and financial data. The analyses were performed to determine the facility?s water savings efficiency and cost reduction during period of 3 years. The results of the research prove that it is possible to manage rainwater for the benefit of the environment and achieve financial gain as a result of savings on charges for water from the municipal water supply and sewage disposal. While the findings of this study should encourage the use of rainwater in sports facilities, they also point to the need for properly designed of water storage tanks to maximise system efficiency.

With pending removal and reconstruction of aging reservoirs and planning of new reservoirs in this area, it is advisable to evaluate the likely impact of the existing and alternative reservoir network layouts on the hydrologic regime for more effective water resources planning and management. In this study, reservoirs of multiple sizes in the PLB were integrated into a coupled land surface-hydrologic model (CLHMS) fully coupled with a reservoir scheme. The extended model was then validated and applied to investigate the impact of existing reservoirs. Seven hypothetical scenarios were additionally set up by removing all the reservoirs, replacing smaller reservoirs with few larger ones, replacing larger reservoirs with many smaller ones, moving all reservoirs downstream or upstream, increasing or decreasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, respectively. In all, eight simulations were conducted and analyzed using the Indictors of Hydrologic Alterations (IHA) for the period of 1981-1999. Results indicate that the existing reservoirs in the PLB are able to effectively displace the excessive streamflow in the wet season to the dry season and mitigate the hydrological extremes. By increasing the mean inflow of reservoirs, the effectiveness of reservoirs in downstream flow regulation can be further enhanced. Similarly, replacing many small reservoirs with a few large ones with a same total capacity can lead to more resiliency against the downstream flow variability and extremes, only if the total mean inflow of the new large reservoirs is not considerably lower than that of the small ones. Relocating reservoirs to a different place with similar mean inflow, however, has a relatively minor and probably case-dependent impact on the hydrologic regime. On the other hand, the ecological analysis on the IHA parameters indicates that the layout preferable for the effective flow regulation may not necessarily be ecologically preferable. In general, this study comprehensively evaluates the hydrological impact of reservoir network layouts, and can provide implications for stakeholders to reach a trade-off between reservoir capacity distribution, locations and mean inflow not only in the PLB but also in different regions worldwide.

Extreme weather events and disease outbreaks have the potential to disrupt production in these areas, which could reduce the national output of meat, dairy and eggs. Additionally, geographically concentrated livestock and feed production systems have been observed to contribute excessive nutrient loads to surrounding soil and water bodies, thereby threatening environmental sustainability. Geographic relocation of production systems has been proposed as an adaptation strategy to increase system resilience and this could take the shape of more geographically dispersed livestock feed production. We estimate the degree to which the demand for meat, dairy and eggs in the Northeast region is met with current levels of regional feed and livestock production, a term that we refer to as regional self-reliance. We combine mean annual (2001-2010) data on Northeast regional land use; crop output; meat, dairy and egg output; and food consumption with a livestock feed requirements model. An annual mean of over 6.1 million ha of land in the Northeast was dedicated to livestock feed from 2001 to 2010, with nearly 80% located in just three states (Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia). The region is a net importer of livestock feed (in terms of total digestible nutrients and crude protein), as well as meat, dairy and eggs (in terms of total human-edible energy and protein). This is the result of a confluence of long-term regional trends that include the movement of agricultural production out of the region with a concomitant increase in the regional population and an increase in the national demand for meat, dairy and eggs. Limited slaughter output in the region is a key limiting factor to increasing the region's self-reliance for livestock products. feed conversion; regional food system; livestock production;NEW-YORK-STATE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; AGRICULTURE IMPLICATIONS; FOOD-CONSUMPTION; REQUIREMENTS; CAPACITY; MODEL; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS","Forest Management for Climate Change in New England and the Klamath Ecoregions: Motivations, Practices, and Barriers Understanding perceptions and attitudes of forest managers toward climate change and climate adaptive forest management is crucial, as they are expected to implement changes to forest resource management. We assessed the perceptions of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices through a survey of forest managers working in private firms and public agencies in New England and the Klamath ecoregion (northern California and southwestern Oregon). We analyzed the motivations, actions, and potential barriers to action of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices. Results suggest that managing for natural regeneration is the most common climate adaptive forest management approach considered by forest managers in both regions. Lack of information about the best strategies for reducing climate change risks, lack of education and awareness among the clients, and perceived client costs were forest managers' primary barriers to climate adaptive management. Our findings suggest useful insights toward the policy and program design in climate adaptive forest management for both areas. climate adaptive forest management; forest managers; perceptions; outreach and extension; climate change;CHANGE ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; MITIGATION; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; FUTURE; CARBON","Monitoring the inter-decade spatial-temporal dynamics of the Sundarban mangrove forest of India from 1990 to 2019 The space borne remote sensing satellite systems are increasingly used in ecological monitoring, growth dynamics, and mapping of mangrove extent worldwide. Sundarban is the largest, diverse contiguous productive mangrove ecosystem and is increasingly threatened by both environmental changes and anthropogenic forces. The study focuses on the spatio-temporal dynamics in the Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem using time-series Landsat satellite imagery during the periods from 1990 to 1999, 1999 to 2009, and 2009 to 2019. The maximum likelihood classifier approach has been applied for image classification and post-classification comparison techniques for change detection analysis over the study period. The findings revealed a decline of 3.76% areal extent of mangroves forest between 1990 and 2019. The areal extent of the Indian Sundarban mangrove areas has been maintained at a relatively constant despite the high population density in its immediate surrounding region. The overall accuracies of 72%, 83%, 79%, and 85.9% were recorded for the classified satellite image of 1990, 1999, 2009, and 2019, respectively. The present study is of great significance to the restoration and conservation of the mangrove forests in response to global climatic change. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Installed PV capacity increased from 100 MW in 2016 up to 2682.7 MW in July 2020. In 2019 alone, 104,000 microinstallations (up to 50 kWp) were installed in Poland. The paper determines the energy gain and the associated reduction of CO2 emissions for two types of solar installation located in Poland. The monofacial solar modules with a power of 5.04 kWp (located in Leki) and bifacial solar modules with a power of 6.1 kWp (located in Bydgoszcz). Both installations use mono-crystalline Si-based 1st generation PV cells. With comparable insolation, a bifacial installation produces approx. 10% (for high insolation) to 28% (for low insolation) more energy than a monofacial PV installation. Avoided annual CO2 emission in relation to the installation capacity ranges from 0.58 to 0.64 Mg/kWp for monofacial and from 0.68 to 0.74 Mg/kWp for bifacial and is on average approx. 16% higher for bifacial installations. Cost-benefit analyses were made. For different electricity prices, the NPV for monofacial and bifacial was determined. photovoltaic; monofacial PV; bifacial PV; renewable energy source; CO2 emission; my electricity; PV; Poland; M&#243; j Pr&#261; d;GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; SOLAR PV; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE","Evaluating the strength of the land-atmosphere moisture feedback in Earth system models using satellite observations The relationship between terrestrial water storage (TWS) and atmospheric processes has important implications for predictability of climatic extremes and projection of future climate change. In places where moisture availability limits evapotranspiration (ET), variability in TWS has the potential to influence surface energy fluxes and atmospheric conditions. Where atmospheric conditions, in turn, influence moisture availability, a full feedback loop exists. Here we developed a novel approach for measuring the strength of both components of this feedback loop, i.e., the forcing of the atmosphere by variability in TWS and the response of TWS to atmospheric variability, using satellite observations of TWS, precipitation, solar radiation, and vapor pressure deficit during 2002-2014. Our approach defines metrics to quantify the relationship between TWS anomalies and climate globally on a seasonal to interannual timescale. Metrics derived from the satellite data were used to evaluate the strength of the feedback loop in 38 members of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble (LENS) and in six models that contributed simulations to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). We found that both forcing and response limbs of the feedback loop in LENS were stronger than in the satellite observations in tropical and temperate regions. Feedbacks in the selected CMIP5 models were not as strong as those found in LENS, but were still generally stronger than those estimated from the satellite measurements. Consistent with previous studies conducted across different spatial and temporal scales, our analysis suggests that models may overestimate the strength of the feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. We describe several possible mechanisms that may contribute to this bias, and discuss pathways through which models may overestimate ET or overestimate the sensitivity of ET to TWS. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE PROJECTIONS; DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM; SOIL-MOISTURE; COUPLING STRENGTH; CMIP5 SIMULATIONS; UNITED-STATES; PART I; AFTERNOON PRECIPITATION; GLACE-CMIP5 EXPERIMENT; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE","Decomposition analysis of the decoupling process between economic growth and carbon emission in Beijing city, China: A sectoral perspective Cities play a major role in decoupling economic growth from carbon emission for their significant role in climate change mitigation from national level. This paper selects Beijing (economic center and leader of emission reduction in China) as a case to examine the decoupling process during the period 2000-2015 through a sectoral decomposition analysis. This paper proposes the decoupling of carbon emission from economic growth or sectoral output by defining the Tapio decoupling elasticity, and combined the decoupling elasticity with decomposition technique such as Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index approach. The results indicate that agriculture and industrial sectors presented strong decoupling state, and weak decoupling is detected in construction and other industrial sectors. Meanwhile, transport sector is in expansive negative decoupling while trade industry shows expansive coupling during the study period. Per-capita gross domestic product, industrial structure, and energy intensity are the most significant effects influencing the decoupling process. Agriculture and industry are conducive to decoupling of carbon emissions from economic output, while transport and trade are detrimental to the realization of strong decoupling target between 2000 and 2015. However, construction and other industrial sectors exerted relatively little minor impact on the whole decoupling process. Improving and promoting energy-saving technologies in transport sector and trade sector should be the key strategy adjustments for Beijing to reduce carbon emissions in the future. The study aims to provide effective policy adjustments for policy makers to accelerate the decoupling process in Beijing, which, furthermore, can lay a theoretical foundation for other cities to develop carbon emission mitigation polices more efficiently.

These modifications are commonly modelled in evolutionary theories as adaptive, influencing ecological and evolutionary processes. If plasticity is adaptive., we would predict that the closer to fitness a trait is, the less plastic it would he. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis of 213 studies and measured the plasticity of each reported trait as a coefficient of variation. Traits were categorized as closer to fitness-lite-history traits including reproduction and survival related traits, and farther from fitness-non-life-historytraits including traits related to development, metabolism and physiology, morphology and behaviour. Our results showed, unexpectedly, that although traits differed in their amounts of plasticity, trait plasticity was not related to its proximity to fitness. These findings were independent of taxonomic groups or environmental types assessed. We caution against general expectations that plasticity is adaptive, as assumed by many models of its evolution. More studies are needed that test the adaptive nature of plasticity, and additional theoretical explorations on adaptive and non-adaptive plasticity are encouraged. fitness; demographic buffering; life-history; evolution; environmental variation; (non-) adaptive plasticity;ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTION; ADAPTATION; GENETICS; CANALIZATION; ENVIRONMENT; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; GROWTH","Spatio-temporal distribution of sugarcane potential yields and yield gaps in Southern China The sustainability and production capacity of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum (L.)) in Southern China is essential to ensure sugar security in China, yet potential crop yield and yield gap (the difference between actual and potential crop yield) of sugarcane is poorly known. In this study, the sugarcane growth and development model, QCANE, was validated for sugarcane phenology, stalk height, and yields, then used to simulate potential yields and yield gaps of sugarcane in Southern Chine (SC) between 1970 and 2014. Simulated potential yields decreased as longitude and latitude increased, driven by spatial variation in solar radiation and maximum temperature. The gap between potential and water-limited yields was noticeably larger in Yunnan province because of the prevalence of seasonal water deficiency. However, nitrogen stress was the dominant driver of the yield gap, given the abundant precipitation in SC. Across SC, large variation in the yield gap between water-and-nitrogen limited yields and on-farm yields was observed for different counties, a difference that was usually larger than the local yield gap. Averaged across SC, on-farm sugarcane yields were only 27% of potential yields, 31% of water-limited yields, and 52% of nitrogen-limited yields. This result highlights considerable potential to significantly increase sugarcane production by improving varieties, government support, effective management measures such as fertilization, irrigation, and mechanization.

At the European level, the control of invasive alien species is a major goal of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and a cornerstone, in this sense, is the Regulation (EU) no.l 43/2014 on invasive alien species. In this study, we focus on the Alpine and Continental biogeographical regions of Europe (defined in art. 1 of the Habitats Directive; 92/43/EEC), and aim to give an overview of the main protected forest habitat types threatened by invasive alien species, and focus on five major invasive alien tree species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Prunuss serotina, Quercus rubra, and Robiniapseudoacacia). We considered the assessment reports under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for the period 2007-2012, and six documents on the interpretation of habitats, to identify those most threatened by invasive alien species and in particular by the five invasive alien trees. We also assessed selected examples of impacts by these alien tree species on different species groups within Natura 2000 sites to highlight potential effects on biodiversity. Riparian forest habitats and oak dominated woodlands are among the most prone to invasion within the two biogeographical regions. A altissima and R pseudoacacia are the most reported invasive alien trees in these protected forest habitat types. Furthermore, examples of the impacts of these tree species have indicated potential detrimental effects on forest habitats structure and functions, and on single species listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives. In conclusion, we emphasise the need for effective management and systematic monitoring of these five invasive alien tree species within Natura 2000 sites. ","Nitrous oxide emissions under a four-year crop rotation system in northern Japan: impacts of reduced tillage, composted cattle manure application and increased plant residue input In the context of their role in global warming, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soil under different management practices were studied in Hokkaido, northern Japan. To assess the impacts of reduced tillage, composted cattle manure-based fertilization and amendments with crop residues and green manure on N2O emissions from soil, a field experiment was conducted under a four-year crop rotation on a well-drained Andisol. The crop rotation included potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) or sweet corn (Zea mays L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). The cumulative N2O emissions for the four-year study period differed widely (0.33 to 4.90kgNha1), depending on the treatments imposed, being the greatest for a combination of conventional moldboard plow tillage, composted cattle manure-based fertilization and increased plant residue input, and the lowest for a combination of conventional tillage, chemical fertilizer-based fertilization and normal plant residue input treatments. The cumulative N2O emissions under reduced tillage were all small, irrespective of fertilization and plant residue input treatments. Composted cattle manure-based fertilization (P0.01) and increased plant residue input (P0.01) significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions. Tillage showed a significant interaction with fertilization and plant residue input, indicating that N2O emissions were enhanced when composted cattle manure, crop residues and green manure were incorporated by conventional tillage. In the present study, the N2O emission factors for chemical fertilizer, composted cattle manure and crop residues were 0.26 +/- 0.44, 0.11 +/- 0.16 and 0.03 +/- 0.52%, respectively, all much lower than the country-specific emission factor for Japan's well-drained soils (0.62%) and the default emission factor used in the IPCC guideline (1%). composted cattle manure; crop residue; emission factor; nitrous oxide; reduced tillage;N2O EMISSIONS; SOILS","Climate information to support wildlife management in the North Central United States This paper investigates what is needed to make climate and weather information more usable for the wildlife management practitioners and ecological researchers in the Prairie Potholes Region (PPR) of the North Central United States. Using interviews, policy document analysis, and participant observation, we identify climate and weather information needs, barriers to use, and opportunities to provide better information to these users. We found that the research and management communities need guidance on how to interpret and apply existing information. Climate information needs in the PPR are driven by the need to understand how projected changes in precipitation will impact prairie wetland ecology. Primary needs include guidance towards selecting, interpreting, and using various climate information products to understand impacts and explanations of the differences between new products and previously available information. Another need includes information on how the societal responses to climate change will further impact ecological systems. Existing management priorities, limited institutional resources, and limited ecological data are remaining barriers that can be ameliorated by leveraging existing policy processes or trusted sources of information to provide guidance, thereby reducing time and costs associated with using climate information in wildlife policy planning. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of the social and ecological aspects of the decision-making context to shape climate information needs, barriers, and entry points. Additional research is needed on the diverse ways that users engage with and use climate information, and additional efforts are needed to co-produce guidance documents that interpret climate information for management and research communities.

Most studies have only estimated the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity at a regional or national level. This overlooks localized effects at the subnational level, especially within defined agro-ecological regions. Using 30 years (1981-2011) of crop yield and weather data in Zambia, we apply the Just and Pope framework to determine how rainfall and temperature affect yield and yield variability of beans and maize at the national and agro-ecological region levels. At the national level, we find significant negative effect of a rise in temperature on bean and maize yield, while rainfall increases have a positive effect on bean and maize yields. These results differ by agro-ecological region. Rainfall has a positive and significant effect on maize yield in the low rainfall regions I and II, but it has a negative effect on maize yield in the high-rainfall region III and no significant effect on bean yield. Temperature has varied effects by regions and crops. Predicted impacts using HadGEM-ES2 global circulation model show that major yield decreases (25% for maize and 34% for beans) by 2050 will be in region II and will be driven mainly by temperature increase offsetting the positive gains from rainfall increase. The model predominantly overpredicts bean yield and under predicts maize yields. These results call for agro-ecological region-specific adaptation strategies and inventive agricultural policy interventions which are more robust to climate change. nan;Beans; Climate change; Crop production; Just and Pope model; Maize; Zambia","The Legislative Framework of the Management of the Protected Areas in Greece.

The Legislative Framework of the Management of the Protected Area in Greece; the Case of the National Marine Park of Zakynthos. In: Micallef, A.

The protection of areas presenting a particular natural beauty goes back to antiquity. There are references 2,000 years ago about some areas in India where any form of commercial exploitation was prohibited so that natural resources were protected. There was a similar form of protection for hunting sites in Europe. In Greece the first protected area was the National Woodland Park of Mount Olympus, the 'home of the gods', in 1938. As the number of the protected areas started increasing significantly the need for policy review with regard to the legal protection and the management of these areas emerged. Although Greece is an insular country with an expanded coastline and a wealth of marine resources, only two marine areas were designated by law as protected areas in 1999: the National Marine Park of Zakynthos (NMPZ) and the National Marine Park of Alonissos Northern Sporades (NMPANS), currently the largest marine protected area in Europe (approximately 2,260 sq. km). Both areas are well-established destinations for domestic and international tourists. However, what is particular is the fact that NMPZ hosts the most important loggerhead sea turtle Caretta-caretta nesting rookery in the Mediterranean while NMPANS hosts the critically endangered species of monk seal Monachus-monachus. As it can be inferred, land-use conflicts for the sake of the economic development of these areas are a common phenomenon nowadays. The purpose of this paper is to examine the particular problems emerging from the enforcement of the legislation governing the operation of NMPZ, which plays host to hundreds of sea turtle nests each season, taking into consideration the fact that the island attracts thousands of visitors every summer. An assessment of the viability of the marine park will be made and solutions with regard to the sustainable development of the area will be suggested. These suggestions could possibly serve as the main platform for review policy of the current legislative framework by the newly-established Greek Ministry for the Environment, Energy and Climate Change. marine park; ptotected areas Zakynthos;nan","Non-renewable and renewable energy consumption and CO2 emissions in OECD countries: A comparative analysis This paper attempts to explore the determinants of CO2 emissions using the STIRPAT model and data from 1980 to 2011 for OECD countries. The empirical results show that non-renewable energy consumption increases CO2 emissions, whereas renewable energy consumption decreases CO2 emissions. Further, the results support the existence of an environmental Kuznets cunie between urbanisation and CO2 emissions, implying that at higher levels of urbanisation, the environmental impact decreases. Therefore, the overall evidence suggests that policy makers should focus on urban planning as well as clean energy development to make substantial contributions to both reducing non-renewable energy use and mitigating climate change.

","How can policy influence innovation: An exploration of climate-smart activities in Emilia-Romagna Climate change is one of the main issues in agriculture. Considering its involvement in the global anthropogenic emissions (GHG) it is no wonder that research is devising ways on how to reduce such effects. A solution to such problems is climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In this paper, we analysed which are the main opportunities granted by agricultural policies when aimed at sustaining innovative agricultural models. A review of the ongoing 93 Rural Development Projects (RDPs) uncovered potential climate-smart solutions for the identified potential threats. The Ministry of Agriculture, Hunting and Fishing of the Region of Emilia-Romagna in Italy has given importance to RDPs to innovate the agricultural sector through policy measures. We analysed an Operational Group (OG) project as an overview of the work. In the case of Emilia-Romagna, the amount of innovation and solutions that can be achieved if policies invest in CSA is very clear. Emilia-Romagna is on the forefront of technological and practical advancements in the EU by implementing CSA as one of the primary solutions to the aforementioned problems and will continuously work on transitioning its agricultural practices to fight climate change.

Describing how policies could effectively and feasibly manage such possible mitigation obstruction has proven elusive. One option would be to strategically link the international policies of mitigation and solar geoengineering. Here I explore this by disaggregating states based on their relevant characteristics. I propose linkages of mitigation policy with: (1) solar geoengineering research and development, (2) decision-making regarding whether to deploy solar geoengineering, and (3) how to deploy solar geoengineering. Based on the incentives that states would face under them, these linkages are assessed on whether they can be expected to effectively increase mitigation and are seem minimally feasible. Linkages in each of the three categories have potential and could occur sequentially. In the linkage which I believe has the greatest potential, one or more states would proclaim their right to deploy solar geoengineering if and only if they meet their own mitigation goals and the rest of the world insufficiently mitigates, and would promise to forego deployment if either condition is not met. I identify this proposed linkage's possible challenges, including legitimacy, credibility, optimal size, relations among targets of the linkage, stringency of mitigation goals, and potential counterproductivity. Limitations to this exploration and assessment include the speculative nature, the assumption that states' preferences regarding mitigation and solar geoengineering are properly related, and the use of noncooperative linkage. Key policy insights Solar geoengineering could reduce the impacts of climate change but is controversial, in large part because of concerns that its research, development, or use might obstruct efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. I explore and assess whether linking international policies of greenhouse gas emissions reductions and solar geoengineering could feasibly and effectively increase emissions reductions. In the linkage that I believe has the greatest potential, one or more states would proclaim their right to deploy solar geoengineering if and only if they meet their emissions reductions goals and other countries do not.

Nonetheless, low-diversity grain production systems based on double cropping (two crops in the same agricultural year) repeated over time, including soybean followed by maize (known in Brazil as ""second crop maize "") or wheat, remain prevalent in Brazil. The continuous use of these systems can impair soil yield capacity, farmers' profits, and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the grain yield and profitability of different production systems with different levels of plant diversity. This study was based on results obtained during the 2009-2017 cropping seasons through a long-term field trial conducted under NT since 1985 in southern Brazil. The trial covered two 4-year agricultural cycles with two crops per year, resulting in eight crops per cycle and 16 crops over the entire period. The experiment followed a randomized complete block design, with five treatments and four replicates. The treatments involved three diversified crop rotations, comprising different cover crops and two double-crop systems (wheat-soybean and maize-soybean). For a given agricultural year, wheat and cover crops (white oats, black oats, and forage radish) were grown from May to September, and the second crop maize was grown from March to August. Soybean and first crop maize were grown during the summer from October to February. The grain yield, gross revenue, production cost, and cumulative profit were analyzed for each production system. Gross revenue and profit were primarily estimated based on the actual annual average commodity prices received by farmers, and two additional price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) were proposed considering the average prices from 2010 to 2017. Regardless of the cropping season, first crop maize and wheat grain yields were higher in diversified crop rotations. The production system only affected the second crop maize yield in 2010/2011, with a higher value obtained in a diversified crop rotation system. The soybean yield in diversified crop rotations was higher than that in double crop systems. Considering each cash crop separately, soybean produced the highest average profit (US$ 472.50 ha(-1)), followed by the first crop maize (US$ 245.31 ha(-1)) and wheat (US$ 77.71 ha(-1)), whereas the second crop maize led to economic losses (-US$ 121.73 ha(-1)). All diversified crop rotations produced a higher 8-year cumulative profit and gross margin than the maize-soybean in double-crop system. The relative economic performance of production systems remained unchanged under alternative price scenarios (pessimistic and optimistic) compared with that under the observed (actual) price scenario. However, the cumulative profit of maize and soybean in double-crop system was the most negatively impacted in the pessimistic scenario (-45.9%), indicating greater economic risk. Overall, lack of direct revenues from cover crops were compensated by increased grain yield in the spring-summer season and profitability of diversified crop rotation systems. Therefore, diversified crop rotation systems are economically competitive with double crop systems, rendering them feasible management options for conserving natural resources and increasing crop resilience to adverse climatic conditions.

As climate change is a result of greenhouse gas emissions, different mechanisms were introduced in order to reduce this impact, surely the most significant was set by the Kyoto Protocol. The Republic of Serbia considers a proper policy on environmental protection as one of its priorities. As the switch from traditional to renewable energy sources carries valuable improvements in environmental protection and economic efficacy, the Government encourages the use of renewable energy sources for the production of energy. This paper provides analysis of the potential of renewable energy sources in Serbia, carbon potential and their possible role in mitigation of climate changes. Results presented in the paper can be useful for the improvement of the strategic planning on the national level with the final aim to contribute to the increase in importance of use of renewable energy sources in that planning. climate changes; renewable energy sources; carbon potential;nan","Risk in agriculture: An overview of the theoretical insights and recent development trends during last decade - A review The main purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed overview of the theoretical insights and recent development trends on risk in agriculture.

The level of CDM penetration into sub-Saharan Africa is compared with CDM market trends globally The relatively low CDM penetration in sub-Saharan Africa and the East African Community (SSA/EAC) countries is a result of endogenous barriers, particularly the inadequate general investment climate, the low level of industrialization of many countries, and the lack of CDM capacity, particularly with regard to institutional infrastructure To assess these barriers, case studies were conducted in Rwanda and Uganda, while South Africa was taken as a reference case since it has - in the context of sub-Saharan Africa - a relatively well-developed CDM business The NF Initiative, which was developed to deal with the lack of CDM capacity in Africa, cannot address the general investment climate of host countries or their economic structure as these are beyond its scope Nor does the NF address investors' perceptions of the investment climate, but instead focuses its capacity-building efforts on HAD (human resource development, i e training courses) rather than on institutional questions, thereby failing to address some of the real issues at stake capacity-building; CDM; climate change; East African community; foreign direct investment; Nairobi Framework; sub-Saharan Africa;nan","Beyond headline mitigation numbers: we need more transparent and comparable NDCs to achieve the Paris Agreement on climate change Nationally determined contributions (NDCs) were key to reaching the Paris Agreement and will be instrumental in implementing it. Research was quick to identify the 'headline numbers' of NDCs: if these climate action plans were fully implemented, global mean warming by 2100 would be reduced from approximately 3.6 to 2.7A degrees C above pre-industrial levels (Hohne et al. Climate Pol 17:1-17, 2016; Rogelj et al. Nature 534:631-639, 2016). However, beyond these headline mitigation numbers, NDCs are more difficult to analyse and compare. UN climate negotiations have so far provided limited guidance on NDC formulation, which has resulted in varying scopes and contents of NDCs, often lacking details concerning ambitions. If NDCs are to become the long-term instrument for international cooperation, negotiation, and ratcheting up of ambitions to address climate change, then they need to become more transparent and comparable, both with respect to mitigation goals, and to issues such as adaptation, finance, and the way in which NDCs are aligned with national policies. Our analysis of INDCs and NDCs (Once a party ratifies the Paris Agreement, it is invited to turn its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) into an NDC. We refer to results from our INDC analysis rather than our NDC analysis in this commentary unless otherwise stated.) shows that they omit important mitigation sectors, do not adequately provide details on costs and financing of implementation, and are poorly designed to meet assessment and review needs. nan;TRANSPORT","Risk or Efficacy? How Psychological Distance Influences Climate Change Engagement Construal-level theory suggests that high-level abstract features weigh more in people's decision-making at farther distance, while low-level concrete features weigh more at closer distance. Based on this, we propose that psychological distance will influence the effect of risk versus efficacy framing on climate change engagement. In particular, risk perception related to the end-state expectancy of climate change mitigation should influence people's climate change engagement at farther distance. In contrast, efficacy perception related to the perceived feasibility of attaining end-state goals should influence engagement at closer distance. Results from an experimental survey based on a national sample that is both demographically and geographically representative (N = 1,282) supported our proposition. At closer spatial distance, perceived efficacy boosted by efficacy framing increased participants' intention to perform climate mitigation behaviors. In contrast, at farther distance, risk framing increased behavioral intention through heightened risk perception. Based on these findings, we suggest that when communicating distant and abstract risks, highlighting their disastrous impacts may better motivate action. In contrast, when communicating impending and concrete risks, stressing the feasibility of action may have stronger motivational potential.

To quantitatively evaluate the role of source control in the overall urban drainage system, rainfall depths of different return periods and rainfall durations were calculated based on the rainfall intensity formulas of 342 cities in China and used to design/size traditional urban drainage pipes. Furthermore, design rainfalls for RSC facilities corresponding to four Volume Capture Ratio of annual rainfall (VCRar, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) were determined using the 30-yr historical rainfall data. Under the combination of RSC facilities with VCRar (or sizes) and the traditional drainage facilities (TrDFs), the contribution of RSC facilities and TrDFs to capture or convey rainwater was quantified for the rainfall with different durations (5-120 min) and different durations (1-5 yr) of studied cities in China. Finally, equivalent or effective design-return-periods for combined RSC and TrDFs were determined to evaluate the improvement effect of the RSC facilities on the design return period of urban drainage system with both facilities. The RSC facilities play an obvious role in improving the return period, even the RSC facilities designed using small VCRar can considerably improve the effective return period. The improvement effect in South China is more significant than that in North China.

This study is an attempt to assess livelihood strategies pursued by rural households, investigate the most remunerative strategy, and identify the factors that influence a household's choice of better strategies in rural Nepal. Primary data collected in 453 households from three villages of central Nepal are analyzed quantitatively within a sustainable livelihood framework. This study categorized households into five main livelihood strategy groups. The results showed that the majority (61%) of the households diversified their income to non-farm sources. Livelihood diversification to business/enterprise strategies adopted by 16% of the households is the most remunerative strategy followed by commercial farming that includes 13% of the sample and are more relevant to poverty reduction. Land holding, education, agriculture and skill training, access to credit, and proximity to the road and market center are the major influencing factors on the adoption of higher returning livelihood strategies. Stimulating poor households to follow market-oriented farm and non-farm activities by improving access to education, vocational training, rural credit, and rural infrastructures is momentous for reducing poverty in the rural areas of central Nepal. livelihood strategy; poverty; cluster analysis; multivariate analysis; elevation; central Nepal;INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURE; SETTLEMENTS; DEPENDENCE; HIGHLANDS; LABOR; LAND","Fisheries catch misreporting and its implications: The case of Senegal The marine resources in Senegal are still relatively abundant, and Senegalese fisheries generate a high economic value for local communities. These fisheries are characterized by a large number of distant-water fleets alternating between legal and illegal operations, depending on circumstances, and a rapid increase of artisanal fishing effort. The extent of the impact of artisanal fisheries on fisheries resources and the Senegalese economy is as poorly known as is the level of illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) industrial fishing. The former relies on official surveys and voluntary reports by fishers, while the existence of the latter was largely denied in the past. Large and frequent 'migrations' (i.e., incursions into the waters of neighbouring countries) by Senegalese artisanal fishers, under-estimation of fishing effort and increasing conflicts over fisheries suggest that officially reported catch data do not reflect reality. A thorough literature review, experts and industry consultations were used to reconstruct Senegalese fisheries catch data. Official national data were compared to the data supplied to FAO and adjusted from 1950 to 2010. Reported and missing sub-sectors, including artisanal catches within and outside Senegalese waters, non-commercial sub-sectors, and industrial catches by the legal and illegal fleets, were conservatively re-assessed. The impacts of the intensive illegal fishing activities on artisanal fisheries and the economy were investigated. The results showed substantial under-reporting, ranging from 4 times higher than the official data in the past to about 1.6 times recently. Artisanal fisheries, according to official data, were responsible for 50% of total extractions, as opposed to 80% 20 years ago. However, while catches by migrant fishers increased dramatically, artisanal catches from Senegalese waters decreased despite an increasing effort, suggesting over-capacity. IUU catches, which were worth around $ 300 million US annually, whether transhipped or otherwise spirited out of Senegalese waters, or discarded, represent a huge loss to Senegal. Also, the foreign fleet, illegally exploiting Senegalese fisheries resources, impact strongly on the migrations of Senegalese artisanal fishers, who in turn increase their migrations as an adaptation strategy to meet their need for fish in the face of rapid resource depletion.

However, questions remain with regard to (1) the quality of these plans, (2) the underlying planning processes, and (3) the implementation of planned actions. This study helps to fill these gaps by evaluating hazard mitigation plans from 19 counties in western Washington State, using seven components of plan quality. This evaluation was supplemented with an online survey of 27 hazard planning professionals in these counties, exploring their perceptions of collaboration in the respective planning processes, as well as implementation of the plans. Overall, the plans excel in some components of plan quality (e.g., vision statement) but suggest room for improvement in other components (e.g., policies and actions). Survey results do not provide evidence that more collaborative planning processes yield higher-quality plans in the context of these counties. Additionally, although the plan evaluation finds elements of high-quality plans, the survey identifies barriers to implementation, including deficiencies in funding, coordination, and leadership. nan;COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; LOCAL PLANS; CONFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; OUTPUTS","Operationalising the water-energy-food nexus through the theory of change The water-energy-food (WEF) nexus facilitates understanding of the intricate and dynamic interlinkages among the three resources. Its implementation can enhance resource securities and sustainable development. Despite its potential, full adoption of the approach has been hindered by a lack of actionable strategies to guide its practical application. This is attributed to (i) poor data (ii) lack of empirical evidence, (iii) inadequate analytical tools, and (iv) lack of clarity on applicable spatial scale. This study undertook a literature review, coupled with systemic analyses of a WEF nexus analytical model, whose outputs were used as a basis to develop a Theory of Change, an iterative outline for operationalising the approach in the context of southern Africa. The consultative and iterative Theory of Change culminated with the formulation of pathways to (i) overcome the barriers impeding WEF nexus operationalisation, (ii) mitigation of trade-offs while enhancing synergies towards attaining simultaneous resource securities, (iii) poverty alleviation and reduction of inequalities, and (iv) reconciling policy with implementation scale. The WEF nexus operationalisation outcomes are linked to Sustainable Development Goals 2 (zero hunger), 6 (clean water and sanitation), and 7 (affordable and clean energy), with synergies to SDGs 1 (no poverty), 5 (gender equality), 8 (decent work and economic growth), 12 (responsible consumption and production), 13 (climate action), 14 (life below water), and 15 (life on land). Operationalising the WEF nexus through an interactive process can inform sustainable pathways towards resource security, job and wealth creation, improved livelihoods and well-being, and regional integration.

To address these inefficiencies, a holistic evaluation of trade-offs between services should be conducted in parallel with determining land owners' service provisioning preferences. Recent evidence also suggests that nudging stakeholders' preferences could be a useful policy design tool to address global change challenges. Forest owners' landscape management preferences were nudged to determine the impact on the social efficiency of PES schemes for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation in Finland. ES indicators for biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and the albedo effect were included with traditional provisioning services (i.e. timber) and bioenergy to assess the consequent intra-service trade-offs. Synergies in provisioning of regulating services were identified, but were found to be more efficient when the management objective is for biodiversity conservation rather than climate change regulation. Nudging led to marginal gains in service provisioning above the baseline management and above neutral owner preferences, and increased aggregate service provisioning. This demonstrates the importance of considering intra-service trade-offs and that nudging could be an important tool for designing efficient PES schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hence, such people are very anxious about their personal safety during disasters. The aim of this study was to explain the safety needs of people with disabilities during earthquakes.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted with purposive sampling. A total of 12 people with movement disability, aged between 18 and 60 years, and with an experience of facing earthquakes, participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used.ResultsThe safety needs of people with disabilities were categorized into three phases: those before an earthquake were considering building codes and resistant construction, building safe and resistant-to-climate-change shelters, and securing the room at the home and workplace; that during an earthquake was the existence of personal protection facilities; and those after an earthquake were adaptation of bathrooms in secure areas, prioritizing conex containers instead of tents, and sheltering in a safe and vermin-free area.ConclusionsThe sudden death of people with disabilities during disasters is preventable through proper planning and preparedness of emergency personnel. Hence, identifying the safety needs of these people and inclusion of such plans in disasters management systems can assure safety for people with disabilities during disasters.

Exploring improved classification methods is important to derive good-quality wetland mapping products. This study investigates and applies two artificial neural network (ANN) based ensemble methods, namely, the MultiBoost artificial neural network (MBANN) and the rotation artificial neural network (RANN), for wetland cover classification, taking the Zoige wetland sited in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China as the case area. The RANN trains and combines diverse ANNs by constructing a series of sparse rotation matrices, whereas the MBANN is developed from the sequential iteration in combination with the parallel sampling technique. Sixteen features related to wetland covers were extracted based on the digital elevation model data and Landsat 8 OLI images. The deep visual geometry group (VGG11) and random forests (RF) were implemented for comparison with our methods. The classification capability evaluation shows that our ensemble methods significantly improve the single ANN and outperform the VGG11 and RF. The RANN yields the highest overall accuracy (0.961), followed by the MBANN (0.942), VGG11 (0.934), RF (0.931), and ANN (0.916). We further concern and evaluate the classifier's robustness because it reflects the uniformity of classification capability. The RANN and the MBANN are insensitive to the reduction in data size, resistant to feature variability, and not influenced by data noise. Overall, the use of ensemble techniques can refine single ANN in classification capability and stability. The results from this study attest the important role of ensemble learning, which provides a promising scheme for wetland cover classification.

Towards a Cooperative Ethos and Expressive Reasons This article start from two opposing intuitions in the environmental duties debate. On the one hand, if our lifestyle causes environmental harm, then we have a duty to reduce that impact through lifestyle changes (lifestyle-matters intuition). On the other hand, many people share the intuition that environmental duties cannot demand to alter our lifestyle radically for environmental reasons. These two intuitions underlie the current dualism in the environmental duties debate: those arguing for lifestyle changes (private duties) and those arguing that our duties are limited to promoting just environmental institutions (promotional duties). The paper has two goals: first, to grasp the underlying reasons for the two intuitions, and, second, to provide a proposal that integrates both intuitions. The paper consists of two main parts. The first part examines the 'our-duties-should-be-limited' intuition. Two interpretations are discussed, one under the title 'what I do make no difference', dealing with causality and collective action, and one under the title 'my duty cannot be to change my lifestyle completely', which discusses demandingness, fairness and value conflict. The second part shows how the 'lifestyle-matters' intuition can still play an important role. This part consists of two sections, one on 'how to make a difference', which deals with the idea of a cooperative ethos, and the other with 'why lifestyle matters', discussing expressive rationality and integrity. These ideas allow giving an important place to lifestyle duties, while avoiding the possible counterproductive effect of a private duties account.

Although a number of studies have explored the costs of creating a carbon sink, such an assessment is lacking for China's GHG Voluntary Emissions Reduction Program. This study develops an economic carbon sink costs measurement model for the Pinus elliottii afforestation project, based on the land opportunity cost method, which incorporates carbon sink transaction costs and leakage costs. From this, an empirical analysis on the carbon sink costs and its sensitivity factors was conducted. The results show that, firstly, the carbon sequestration costs of afforestation projects are generally high, ranging from 44.2 Yuan/tCO(2)e to 425.4 Yuan/tCO(2)e with and without considering the benefits of wood, respectively. This is higher than the current average carbon sink price of 20 Yuan/tCO(2)e. Secondly, forestry carbon sink transaction costs have a positive impact on carbon sequestration costs, but the impact is weak. Thirdly, carbon sequestration costs are negatively affected by timber prices but positively influenced by increasing labor prices and discount rate, which is not conductive to the development of carbon sink afforestation projects. In order to strengthen role of forestry in combating climate change, the study holds that the government departments should take measures to reduce carbon sink transaction costs, establish and improve the forestry carbon sink compensation mechanism in the future, and encourage wood-processing companies to make technological innovations to produce and sell durable wood products. The project owners can explore multiple operating models to increase their revenue, including market and non-market benefits, when the carbon sink afforestation project has been launched according to relevant methodologies. afforestation project; forestry carbon sink; land opportunity cost; carbon sink costs; China GHG Voluntary Emission Reduction Program;CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOREST MANAGEMENT; TRANSACTION COSTS; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; DEFORESTATION; MITIGATION; SUBSIDIES; TIMBER; TREES; SINKS","Leaf morpho-anatomical traits in Vigna radiata L. affect plant photosynthetic acclimation to changing vapor pressure deficit Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) influences plant photosynthesis and the hydraulic behaviour associated with stomata regulation. However, it is not clear whether and how changes in leaf morpho-anatomical traits drive photosynthetic acclimation to VPD. Here, we examined the role of leaf anatomy in the eco-physiological responses of Vigna radiata L. to VPD changes in controlled environment. Plants were grown under two VPD levels (high-VPD, HV; low-VPD, LV) and then transferred to the opposite conditions (high-to-low, HLV; low-to-high, LHV). We hypothesised that growth under different VPDs may determine anatomical changes that could affect plant physiological plasticity to VPD variations. HV plant growth (height, leaf area, number of leaves) and gasexchange (net-photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency) were reduced in a range of 16?47 % compared to LV. This was mostly attributed to reduction in stomatal and vein density and lower stomatal conductance. After transferring these plants to a more favourable environment (HLV), they showed unchanged photosynthesis and conductance while LHV plants reduced their gas-exchange rates to control water loss under high evaporative demand. Morpho-anatomical traits (high density and smaller stomata, higher vein density) in LHV plants showed higher physiological plasticity. Therefore, physiological plasticity induced by anatomical traits should be considered when evaluating how plants would cope with environmental changes in a climate change scenario.

In this study, a satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was combined with climate factors to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation change during the growing season, as well as their driving forces in China from 2001 to 2012. Our results showed that the growing season NDVI increased continuously during 2001-2012, with a linear trend of 1.4%/10 years (p < 0.01). The NDVI in north China mainly exhibited an increasing spatial trend, but this trend was generally decreasing in south China. The vegetation dynamics were mainly at a moderate intensity level in both the increasing and decreasing areas. The significantly increasing trend in the NDVI for arid and semi-arid areas of northwest China was attributed mainly to an increasing trend in the NDVI during the spring, whereas that for the north and northeast of China was due to an increasing trend in the NDVI during the summer and autumn. Different vegetation types exhibited great variation in their trends, where the grass-forb community had the highest linear trend of 2%/10 years (p < 0.05), followed by meadow, and needle-leaf forest with the lowest increasing trend, i.e., a linear trend of 0.3%/10 years. Our results also suggested that the cumulative precipitation during the growing season had a dominant effect on the vegetation dynamics compared with temperature for all six vegetation types. In addition, the response of different vegetation types to climate variability exhibited considerable differences. In terms of anthropological activity, our statistical analyses showed that there was a strong correlation between the cumulative afforestation area and NDVI during the study period, especially in a pilot region for ecological restoration, thereby suggesting the important role of ecological restoration programs in ecological recovery throughout China in the last decade.

This research explored the geospatial techniques in assessing the effect of green spaces on the thermal environment of Port Harcourt, Nigeria during a hot-dry season. In this study, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were employed to investigate the effects of vegetation distribution of urban green spaces on the urban thermal environment. LST maps were retrieved from the Thermal Infrared Sensor data of Landsat 8 acquired on 27 December 2018, while urban green spaces were extracted from high-resolution Google Earth Pro imagery. The results showed that a strong negative relationship exists between NDVI and LST, as well as between SAVI and LST which showed that urban green spaces have proven to have substantial cooling effects on the urban thermal environment within the study area. Results further revealed that increasing the area of green spaces to 28.67 ha and above will ensure the attainment of a stronger Park Cooling Intensity (PCI) effect. On the other hand, green spaces which are 8.28 ha or less have a lower PCI effect. The shape (perimeter/area) of green spaces has proven to have a negative correlation with the PCI effect. Green spaces with near-circular configurations will produce a stronger PCI effect. The role of urban greenery in mitigating high discomfort experienced in urban environments is crucial to urban planners and managers in the design of green spaces with a high cooling effect.

Trace element concentrations in groundwater samples from the North Mara mining area of northern Tanzania were analyzed. Statistical analyses for relationships between elemental concentrations in the samples and distance of a sampling site from the mine tailings dam were also conducted. Eleven trace elements (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were determined, and averages of Fe and Al concentrations were higher than levels accepted by the Tanzanian drinking water guideline. Levels of Pb in three samples were higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) drinking water guidelines of 10 and 15 mu g/L, respectively. One sample contained a higher As level than the WHO and USEPA guideline of 10 mu g/L. The correlation between element concentrations and distance from the mine tailings dam was examined using the hierarchical agglomeration cluster analysis method. A significant difference in the elemental concentration existed depending on the distance from the mine tailings dam. Mann-Whitney U-test post hoc analysis confirmed a relationship between element concentration and distance of a sampling site from the mine tailings dam. This relationship raises concerns about the increased risks of trace elements to people and ecosystem health. A metal pollution index also suggested a relationship between elemental concentrations in the groundwater and the sampling sites' proximity from the mine tailings dam. nan;ARSENIC CONTAMINATION; GEITA DISTRICT; ATLANTIC COAST; SOUTHERN SPAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; MINE WATERS; MERCURY; POLLUTION; IMPACTS","How do social status and tree architecture influence radial growth, wood density and drought response in spontaneously established oak forests? Key message During the past decades, a multitude of oak stands have spontaneously established across the pine-dominated landscapes of the French Landes de Gascogne. Yet their future performance under modern climate change is unknown. We show that coppiced, dominant trees are most prepared to cope with drought episodes, displaying higher basal area increment and lower sensitivity to extreme events. Context Forest stands dominated by pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) have spontaneously established across the pine-dominated landscapes of the French Landes de Gascogne. These oak stands are typically unmanaged and unsystematically coppiced, resulting in mixtures of single- and multi-stemmed (coppiced) trees. Aims To determine the ability of spontaneous oak forest stands to face climate change-related hazards, by analysing differences in growth (tree-ring width and basal area increment-BAI), wood density and climate sensitivity depending on their tree architecture (single- vs multi-stemmed trees) and their social status in the forest. Methods We exhaustively cored 15 oak stands (n = 657 trees). We compared stand characteristics and climate sensitivity between tree architectures considering two sampling designs, either all sampled trees (the exhaustive sampling) or those with a dominant status (dominant sampling). At the tree level, we used linear mixed effects models to compare wood density and growth between tree architectures and the trees' social status within the canopy layer (dominant- vs non-dominant trees). Results Multi-stemmed trees exhibited higher wood density than single-stemmed trees for diameters > 30 cm. Dominant multi-stemmed trees showed lower sensitivity to extreme events (pointer years), higher BAI but lower annual growth rates than dominant single-stemmed trees. Conclusion Dominant multi-stemmed trees are potentially the most prepared ones to cope with increasing soil water deficit following drought episodes, at least during the first 60 years of the life of the tree. The vulnerability to face harsher climate conditions for Q. robur stands can be misled when using a dominant sampling design.

While the IPCC will continue to lead Earth System projections for global issues such as greenhouse gas levels and global temperature increase, high-resolution regional Earth System predictions will be crucial for producing effective decision-making tools for day-to-day, sustainable Earth System management and adaptive management of resources. Regional Earth System predictions and projections at the order of a few meters resolution from days to decades must be validated and provide uncertainties and skill scores to be usable. While the task is daunting, it would be criminally negligent of the global human not to embark on this task immediately. The observational needs for the integrated natural-human system for the regional Earth System are distinct from the global needs even though there are many overlaps. The process understanding of the Earth System at the micro scale can be translated into predictive understanding and skillful predictions for sustainable management by merging these observations with Earth System models to go from global scale predictions and projections to regional environmental manifestations and mechanistic depiction of human interactions with the Earth System and exploitation of its resources. Regional Earth System monitoring and predictions thus will continuously take the pulse of the planet to prescribe appropriate actions for participatory decision-making for sustainable and adaptive management of the Earth System and to avoid catastrophic domains of potential outcomes. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; EL-NINO; FORECASTS; UNCERTAINTY; WEATHER; ENVIRONMENT; COMPLEXITY; THINKING","A non-destructive method for estimating woody biomass and carbon stocks of Vitellaria paradoxa in southern Mali, West Africa The shea tree, Vitellaria paradoxa, shields people, crops and livestock in West African parkland agroforestry systems from climate variability. Accurate estimates of accumulated biomass of such key species may support ways to secure financial incentives within global climate policies. In this quest, variation in allometric relations used for biomass (carbon stock) estimates on the basis of stem diameter matters, but parameters a and b of the standard format (AGB = a D-b; AGB = aboveground biomass, D = stem diameter) are correlated and are directly related to tree shapes. Functional branch analysis (FBA) allows non-destructive derivation of allometrics. For Koutiala and Yanfolila shea populations empirical branching parameters were scale-independent, matching FBA assumptions. Allometry (AGB = 169 (D/20)(2.64) and AGB = 146 (D/20)(2.65), kg tree(-1)) implied 22%, 16% and 11% larger vegetative aboveground biomass in Koutiala than in Yanfolila at stem diameters (D) of 10, 20 and 32 cm, respectively. Below-ground biomass predictions (BGB(i) = 8.73 (D-i/10)(2.35) and BGB(i) = 8.16 (D-i/10)(2.38), kg per proximal root) differed - 6% and - 15% for root diameters D-i of 10 and 32 cm, respectively. On a dry weight basis, the shoot:root ratio was 2.7 and 2.9, respectively for the two sites. Stand-level above-and below-ground carbon stocks in Koutiala (2.16 +/- 0.44 and 0.8 +/- 0.15 Mg C ha(-1)) were not significantly different from those in Yanfolila (3.21 +/- 0.60 and 1.26 +/- 0.21 Mg C ha(-1)), respectively. Further research is required to include (potential) fruit production to the plant architectural model.

This study marks the first attempt to combine environmental isotopes analysis with hydrometric and hydrogeological measurements to identify dominant recharge zones for springs in two mountainous catchments-Banlek and Shikarpur-in Far-Western Nepal. In total, 422 water samples collected from rainfall, springs and streams between March 2016 and March 2017 were analyzed for their isotopic composition (delta O-18 and delta D). Isotopic composition of rainwater shows seasonality, suggesting that different sources of water vapor cause rains in monsoon and in dry season. Rainfall responses of individual springs were used to identify connections to unconfined and deeper groundwater strata. The isotopic composition of springs in the two catchments ranges from -9.55 to -8.06 parts per thousand for delta O-18 and -67.58 to -53.51 parts per thousand for delta D. The isotopic signature of the spring sources falls close to the local meteoric water line for the corresponding season, indicating strong rainfall contribution to springs. Altitudinal isotopic gradients suggest mean recharge elevation of 2,600-2,700 m asl for springs in Shikarpur, which lies beyond the surface-water catchment, and a recharge elevation of 1,000-1,100 m asl for Banlek, which partially extends beyond the surface-water catchment. The demarcated recharge zones will be used by government agencies to implement recharge interventions to increase the resiliency and reliability of springs in Far-Western Nepal. nan;nan","Vulnerability of Subsistence Systems Due to Social and Environmental Change: A Case Study in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska Arctic Indigenous communities have been classified as highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The remoteness of Arctic communities, their dependence upon local species and habitats, and the historical marginalization of Indigenous peoples enhances this characterization of vulnerability. However, vulnerability is a result of diverse historical, social, economic, political, cultural, institutional, natural resource, and environmental conditions and processes and is not easily reduced to a single metric. Furthermore, despite the widespread characterization of vulnerability, Arctic Indigenous communities are extremely resilient as evidenced by subsistence institutions that have been developed over thousands of years. We explored the vulnerability of subsistence systems in the Cup'ik village of Chevak and Yup'ik village of Kotlik through the lens of the strong seasonal dimensions of resource availability. In the context of subsistence harvesting in Alaska Native villages, vulnerability may be determined by analyzing the exposure of subsistence resources to climate change impacts, the sensitivity of a community to those impacts, and the capacity of subsistence institutions to absorb these impacts. Subsistence resources, their seasonality, and perceived impacts to these resources were investigated via semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping-calendar workshops. Results suggest that while these communities are experiencing disproportionate impacts of climate change, Indigenous ingenuity and adaptability provide an avenue for culturally appropriate adaptation strategies. However, despite this capacity for resiliency, rapid socio-cultural changes have the potential to be a barrier to community adaptation and the recent, ongoing shifts in seasonal weather patterns may make seasonally specific subsistence adaptations to landscape particularly vulnerable.

The EU has developed an elaborate system to monitor national policy mixes in order to support these challenging requirements. Data that member states have reported to the EU over the last ten years reveal that the average expected per-policy-instrument emission reduction has declined, while national policy mixes have remained generally stable over time. This is strikingly discordant with the EU's ambitious commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050 ('net zero'). climate policy; policy monitoring; policy mixes; policy change; policy sectors; EU;ADMINISTRATIVE DATA; BIG DATA; CLIMATE; LESSONS","Family climate in children living with parents who harmfully consume alcohol The family climate has notable impact on cognitive, emotional, behavioural, social and physical development of children and adolescents and can be influenced by parents' health status. The present study aimed at evaluating whether living with a parent with alcohol use disorder negatively influences the perceived emotional family climate, parental attitudes and internal representations of family relationships. Forty-five children living with a parent with alcohol use disorder and 45 controls, matched for sex and age, completed the Level of Expressed Emotion Scale and the Family Attitudes Questionnaire. Their significant parent completed the Parental Attitudes Scale. The results suggested that living with a parent with an alcohol use disorder increased the risk of having perceived higher levels of emotional response, attitude towards illness and expectations from their parents; it also increased the probability of being exposed to lower parental pleasure and of having represented worse family relationships. Emotion regulation interventions might be useful to protect children living with a parent with alcohol use disorder from a potential chaotic and unpredictable family environment. alcohol use disorder; children of alcoholics; family climate; parental attitudes; representations of family relationships;ATTITUDES; UNPREDICTABILITY; PREDICTORS; RECOVERY; PROGRAM; STATES; YOUTH","Future Risks of Unprecedented Compound Heat Waves Over Three Vast Urban Agglomerations in China Accounting for only a limited fraction of Earth's land surface, urban areas accommodate more than half the global population. The projected increasing severe heat waves with global warming exert a profound threat to the dense urban population and infrastructure. Despite abundant past studies on heat waves, there was a lack of attention to the daytime-nighttime compound heat waves. Here, we categorize summertime heat waves into three distinct types, that is, independent daytime or nighttime heat waves and compound heat waves. Using a universal heat wave metric, we identify the strongest compound heat waves on record (1961-2015) in three vast urban agglomerations in China. We demonstrate substantial increase of the land areas affected by severe compound heat waves over the past three decades. We further quantify the changes in areal and population exposures to future unprecedented compound heat waves. Our results show that under a high-end emission scenario, 50% (100%) of the land area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta will be exposed to historically unprecedented compound heat waves on a regular basis by 2050 (2090), 2050 (2070), and 2030 (2050), respectively. Such enhancing heat hazard will induce increasing population exposure of nearly 70, 90, and 60 million to unprecedented compound heat waves by the end of this century (relative to the 2010s). Our findings call for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to alleviate the risks of unprecedented compound heat waves in rapidly developing populous urban areas. Plain Language Summary Extreme heat waves impose devastating impacts on human health, economy, and the environment. The risk of extreme heat stress tends to be higher in urban areas than in surroundings, due to greater population exposure and added heat stress from urban heat island. Compared to daytime- or nighttime-only heat waves, the risk of compound heat waves that combine scorching days and sweltering nights sequentially tends to be higher. Focusing on top three populous urban agglomerations in China, this study dissects summertime heat waves into three nonoverlapping types and identifies the strongest heat waves on record based on a universal metric of heat wave magnitude. Projections show that unprecedented compound heat waves will become the norm since around 2045 (2060), 2045 (2065), and 2030 (2040) in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, respectively, under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) emission scenario. Enhancing heat hazards will translate into increasing population exposure of about 70, 90, and 60 million to unprecedented compound heat waves by the end of this century, which are concentrated on the highly urbanized areas, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. This study highlights the urgent adaptation and mitigation efforts for cities against compound heat waves in particular. nan;SUMMER HEAT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; DATASET; PROJECTION; SCENARIOS; EXPANSION; EXPOSURE; EXTREMES; INDEXES","The relative profitability of dairy, sheep, beef and grain farm enterprises in southeast Australia under selected rainfall and price scenarios Dryland farming and its profitability is directly affected by the amount and timing of rainfall that influence and consequently impacts on pasture and crop yields. Yet rainfall is not the sole determinant of farm enterprise profitability; prices of farm inputs and commodities produced also affect farm profits. This study draws on farm commodity prices and input prices from the past 9 years to form correlated price and cost datasets that are then used in examining the profitability of a range of farm enterprises in south eastern Australia under low, average and high rainfall scenarios. Fourteen representative farm enterprises were examined that included the production of Merino fine wool, prime lamb, beef cattle, milk, wheat and canola. The spread of profitability of these farm enterprises against the backdrop of price variability and rainfall scenarios was compared. The results show that profitability of the enterprises studied is currently affected more by changes in rainfall than by commodity prices and that dairy enterprises are the most profitable on a $/ha basis but that the profitability of wheat, steer and prime lamb enterprises are least affected by low rainfall scenarios. The self-replacing cow-calf beef systems, canola and dairy enterprises are the most vulnerable to reduced rainfall and may benefit by reducing profit risk through changes such as expanding the enterprise or diversifying across other types of enterprises. Farm diversification involving combinations of enterprises with negatively correlated profits will enable the variance in farm profits to be reduced. Such actions could form part of farms' adaptation strategies to climate and price variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite the fact that coastal erosion is a natural phenomenon, erosion trends have been largely aggravated by human-induced factors. This study analyzed shoreline change rates for three neighbouring coastal communities in the Central region of Ghana; Elmina, Cape Coast and Moree. Two epochs were analyzed, 1974-2012 (medium-term) and 2005-2012 (short-term), using ArcGIS and Digital Shoreline Analysis System. Overall, the entire study area recorded average shoreline change rates of -1.24 myear(-1) and -0.85 myear(-1) in the medium-term and short-term period respectively. Less consolidated shoreline segments recorded higher erosion rates in both periods while cliffs and rocky segments experienced very little erosion or high stability. Because shorelines undergoing chronic erosion do not fully recover after short-term erosion events such as storms, facilities located close to such shorelines are threatened. Taking a proactive approach to coastal erosion management, such as coastal sand mining prevention, inter-sectoral land use management and adopting a construction setback approach may be prudent for the long-term management of the coast since this recognizes future shoreline changes and safeguards coastal landscape for other uses. climate change; coastal erosion; coastal management; shoreline change;IMPACTS","The use of new economic decision support tools for adaptation assessment: A review of methods and applications, towards guidance on applicability There is a growing focus on the economics of adaptation as policy moves from theory to practice. However, the techniques commonly used in economic appraisal have limitations in coping with climate change uncertainty. While decision making under uncertainty has gained prominence, economic appraisal of adaptation still uses approaches such as deterministic cost-benefit analysis. Against this background, this paper provides a critical review and assessment of existing economic decision support tools (cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis) an uncertainty framework (iterative risk management) and alternative tools that more fully incorporate uncertainty (real options analysis, robust decision making and portfolio analysis). The paper summarises each method, provides examples, and assesses their strengths and weaknesses for adaptation. The tools are then compared to identify key differences, and to identify when these approaches might be appropriate for specific applications in adaptation decision making. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; WATER","Analysis of urban thermal environments based on the perception and simulation of the microclimate in the historic city of Tlemcen Purpose The preservation of historic urban centres prevents anarchic development of the city and ensures a harmonious evolution of the urban form. It also improves the quality of life in the context of climate and environmental change. Morphological and geometric indicators of the urban fabric are key parameters in the formation of external microclimates. They provide a positive effect on the thermal comfort of pedestrians. The objective of this work is to study the impact of the site morphology on the external microclimate and to understand the relationship between the subjective perception and the objective quantification of the thermal environment. The result of this study has allowed us to propose solutions for the creation of a microclimate favourable to the appropriation of outdoor spaces. The authors finally propose guidelines for the design and rehabilitation of the historic site based on the establishment of links between the site's configuration, microclimatic conditions and users' perceptions. Design/methodology/approach Part of this study included the analysis of the microclimate of the historic ""Bab El Hadid"" district of the City of Tlemcen, by developing a questionnaire survey and a numerical simulation validated by measurements of the microclimate the authors made on site. To complete this task, the authors applied the Envi-met 4.1 model during the coldest month of the winter and the hottest month of the summer. Urban parameters are represented at different measurement points characterised by a variability of the sky view factor (SVF). Findings The results presented in terms of average expected the predicted mean vote (PMV) voting, solar access and air temperature. They show that thermal conditions are directly related to the SVF, the height/width ratio (H/L) of streets as well as the orientation of urban canyons. The points located in the streets facing North-South, present an acceptable performance. Streets shaded by trees with a canyon aspect ratio of between 1.18 and 1.70 reduce heat stress in outdoor spaces. The PMV models discussed provide information on the most appropriate locations for pedestrians. The authors have proposed urban orientations that could limit unfavourable conditions in outdoor spaces. They are useful for architects and urban planners in the design and rehabilitation of historic centres. Originality/value In Tlemcen, the microclimate is not taken into account in the design and rehabilitation of urban fabrics. For this specific purpose, the authors want to stress in the research the importance of safeguarding urban heritage through the renewal of the old city and the bioclimatic rehabilitation of its urban spaces.

This paper presents a conceptual framework of policy needs for analysing the science of nature-based solutions' implementation and connect it to the practice of their implementation that advances the literature by connecting well-researched gaps to a more innovative action-oriented policy development approach that we argue is required for embedding scaled-up nature-based solutions. We conceptualise and ground the policy needs framework of skills, knowledge and partnerships theoretically in current literature of NBS policy and planning and empirically in three European case study cities: Genk in Belgium, Glasgow in UK and Poznan in Poland. The cross-case study analysis points to the knowledge needs of systems' thinking and solutions-oriented thinking as paramount for implementing nature-based solutions. Our analysis further points to the skills' needs of negotiation and collaboration for administrative silo bridging and for forging multi-sectoral partnerships essential for planning, and co-managing NBS. We conclude with three ways forward to addressing the policy needs for implementation: first, cities can invest in tailored and targeted capacity building programs, second, institutional spaces need to be established that allow for collaborative learning through and for partnerships and third, cities need to chart governance innovations that promote evidence-based policy for nature-based solutions' design and implementation.

The hypothesis tested is how much the onset dates (TOD) of phenology stages moved earlier due to climate change. Weather and phenological data were collected from 1969 to 2018 and were statistically processed. There was an increase in air temperature (T) during the first 5 months in the year, with a significant rise in March and April; significant linear relationships show an advance in TOD with the years elapsed. Inverse linear relationships were found between TOD, maximum (T-max), mean (T-mean), minimum (T-min) temperature, and sunshine hours (Sh). The relationships between TOD and T-max were the strongest. The early stages of flowering phenology are advancing more strongly than later flowering stages. For apple, in the last 50 years, there was an advance of 13.8 days for stage 51, 14.8 days for stage 53, 10.7 days for stage 61, and only 7.3 days for stage 69; for pear trees, the advance was lower: 10 days for stage 51, 9 days for stage 53, 6.7 days for stage 61, and only 2.1 days for stage 69. These findings, which might be extrapolated to similar environments, have important consequences in fruit growing, like the occurrence of climate accidents due to late frost, insect pollination, and application of pesticides and irrigation water.

Climate impact studies constitute the basis for the formulation of adaptation strategies. Usually such assessments apply statistically postprocessed output of climate model projections to force impact models. Increasingly, time series with daily resolution are used, which require high consistency, for instance with respect to transition probabilities (TPs) between wet and dry days and spell durations. However, both climate models and commonly applied statistical tools have considerable uncertainties and drawbacks. This paper compares the ability of 1) raw regional climate model (RCM) output, 2) bias-corrected RCM output, and 3) a conventional weather generator (WG) that has been calibrated to match observed TPs to simulate the sequence of dry, wet, and very wet days at a set of long-term weather stations across Switzerland. The study finds systematic biases in TPs and spell lengths for raw RCM output, but a substantial improvement after bias correction using the deterministic quantile mapping technique. For the region considered, bias-corrected climate model output agrees well with observations in terms of TPs as well as dry and wet spell durations. For the majority of cases (models and stations) bias-corrected climate model output is similar in skill to a simple Markov chain stochastic weather generator. There is strong evidence that bias-corrected climate model simulations capture the atmospheric event sequence more realistically than a simple WG.

These differences are particularly evident as wolves follow the Bergmann's ecogeographical rule, with low latitude populations being generally smaller than those living at high latitudes. The fossil record of the modern wolf dates back to the second half of the Middle Pleistocene. The earliest records come from the French site Lunel-Viel 1 and are ascribed to the subspecies Canis lupus lunellensis BONIFAY, 1971, and from the Italian Polledrara di Cecanibbio. These Middle Pleistocene forms were generally small in size, slightly larger than the last representative of Canis mosbachensis SOERGEL, 1925. During the last 400 kyr, European continental environments were profoundly affected by the glacial/interglacial cycles and much evidence suggests a trend toward a size increase for C. lupus. In particular, a number of these European large-sized wolves seem to be typical of cold phases, for example, Canis lupus maximus BOUDADI-MALIGNE, 2012 from the OIS 3-2. The aim of the present study was to describe the morphological and morphometric variability of C. lupus from Avetrana bed 8 in comparison to other populations from northern and southern Italy, as well as from other localities in Europe, to obtain a better understanding of the biochronology, palaeobiogeography and evolution of this large carnivore in the last 125 kyr. The morphological and morphometric analyses pointed out the difference of C. lupus of Avetrana compared to the ""Apulian"" and to the Northern Italian wolves but also identified a marked affinity with the C. lupus of the glacial site Cardamone (Apulia), referred to OIS 2.

Regionalization of CWRS is an important prototype for the comprehensive regionalization of CSs. It is also a crucial cutting-edge exploration of interdisciplinary work across cryospheric science, physical geography and human geography. We constructed a quantitative indexing system for the regionalization of CWRS along the dimensions of base-supply-demand informed by the characteristics of cryosphere resources and human use of CSs. Different levels of regionalization are subdivided using cluster analysis, the importance index of CWRS, and a location entropy model. A region in Northwest China with significant CWRS use was the study area. From the joint effects of nature and human activity, there emerge principles of regional differentiation that govern the regionalization of CWRS. The study area was first divided into three high level service regions according to the availability of stored cryosphere water in snow cover, frozen ground and glaciers, indicating the regulatory function of cryosphere components. Second-level regionalization subdivided each region into three sub-regions based on the supply of CSs, determined by the different quantities of snow melt and glacial runoff. The study area was finally subdivided into 63 third-level regional units based on land use and socio-economic indicators, which reflect differences in demand for the CSs. This study provides practical scientific guidance for the future use of CSs, such as the Belt and Road Initiative and new urbanization, and protection of the cryosphere by sustainable development and ecological improvement.

Despite this, biodiesel has yet to reach its full commercial potential, especially in the developing countries. Besides technical barriers, there are several nontechnical limiting factors which impede the development of biodiesel such as feedstock price, production cost, fossil fuel price and taxation policy. This study assesses these by undertaking a techno-economic and sensitivity analysis of biodiesel production in Malaysia, the second largest producer of crude palm oil feedstock. It was found that the life cycle cost for a 50 ktons palm biodiesel production plant with an operating period of 20 years is $665 million, yielding a payback period of 3.52 years. The largest share is the feedstock cost which accounts for 79% of total production cost. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the variation in feedstock price will significantly affect the life cycle cost for biodiesel production. One of the most important findings of this study is that biodiesel price is compatible with diesel fuel when a fiscal incentive and subsidy policy are implemented. For instance, biodiesel price with subsidies of $0.10/l and $0.18/l is compatible and lower than fossil diesel price at crude palm oil price of $1.05/kg or below. As a conclusion, further research on technical as well as nontechnical limitations for biodiesel production is needed before biodiesel can be fully utilized. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous studies had explored the effect of land-use type on waterlogging in relatively small watersheds. Few, however, have comprehensively revealed the relative contributions of the environmental and anthropogenic factors to urban waterlogging concerning different scales of analysis. Indeed what is less known, are the dominant factors and the appropriate scale of analysis. To overcome this limitation, a novel method that integrates the stepwise regression model with hierarchical partitioning analysis is presented. The purpose is to investigate the complex mechanism of urban waterlogging by identifying the relative contribution of each environmental and anthropogenic factor and the stability linking waterlogging to influencing factors at multiple scales of analysis (i.e. 1 km, 2 km, 3 km, 4 km, and 5 km). We consider waterlogging events in the central urban districts of Guangzhou (PR China) from 2009 to 2015 as a case study. The results show that the spatial distribution of waterlogging events in the central urban area presents a strong agglomeration pattern. The waterlogging hot spots are mainly concentrated in the historical area of Guangzhou. Under all analysis scales, we find that the percent cover of urban green spaces (44.74%), percent cover of residential area (41.03%), and slope.std (36.85%) both have a dominant contribution to urban waterlogging, which suggests the importance of land cover composition in determining urban waterlogging. However, the relative contribution and dominant factors of waterlogging varied across different analysis scales, presenting a strong scale effect. Under a small analysis scale (1 km), the topography factors (slope.std and relative elevation) are confirmed as the dominant variables; however, with the increase of analysis scale, the influence of land cover composition (greenspace, residence area, grassland) and land cover spatial configuration (LPI, AI, Cohesion index) on waterlogging magnitude is greater than other factors. This finding provides additional insights that the urban waterlogging can be alleviated by balancing the relative composition of land cover features as well as by optimizing their spatial configuration. Since the optimal statistical scale for urban waterlogging studies only worked for specific influencing factors, the appropriate analysis scale for urban waterlogging study should be determined by the characteristics of study areas. This study has the capability to extend our scientific understanding of the complex mechanisms of waterlogging in the highly urbanized coastal city, providing useful support for the prevention and management of urban waterlogging.

Scientific understanding of the driving mechanism of runoff change is the basis of scientific utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development. In this study, runoff changes at different time scales were analyzed for the period 1960-2018, and the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff were investigated in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River Basin (SRB). A combination of mutation analysis and human-designed analysis was adopted to divide the study period into the baseline period and the variation period. The Mann-Kendall test (M-K) and Double Mass Curve method (DMC) were used to detect abrupt changes and quantify the relative effects of climate change and human activities on runoff. The results reveal a significant declining trend in annual runoff on the whole in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB, and there was an obvious recovery trend after the implementation of the Comprehensive Treatment Program of the SRB (CTSRB) in 2007. Abrupt changes occurred in 1976, 1991 and 2007, which divided the study period into the baseline period (1960-1975), the Variation I period (1976-1990), the Variation II period (1991-2006) and the Variation III period (2007-2018). The contribution of human activities to runoff reduction was 88.72%, whereas the contribution of climate change to runoff reduction was only 11.28%. Furthermore, the contribution of human activities to runoff reduction in the Variation I period, Variation II period and Variation III period was 89.44%, 93.02% and 83.69%, respectively. Therefore, human activities played the most dominant role in the variation of runoff, followed by climate change and upstream runoff. Further analysis of the impact of human activities on runoff indicated that agricultural irrigation was the dominant factor of runoff reduction. This study can provide detailed information on water resources and a scientific basis for the development and utilization of water resources in the future.

These studies typically apply structured interviews and quantitative analyses to situate social capital in disaster management. However, such approaches often fail to present the grounded lens of disadvantaged populations. Through visual narratives, unstructured observations, and semi-structured interviews, this research illuminates how disadvantaged populations bond, bridge, and link social capital to prepare, respond, adapt, and rebuild facing ongoing disasters. In this research, I examine different types of social capital in three disadvantaged communities of metropolitan Manila and Cebu. The majority of disadvantage participants were female; participants from one of the involved communities were mostly deaf. This research applies a mixed-method qualitative analysis with an emphasis on the photovoice approach. The photovoice approach integrated with social media demonstrates an engaging local lens seldom revealed by other methods. It presents how social capital is generated and leveraged beyond the geographical boundaries and possibly the power structure. This project is perhaps the first photovoice research to visualize social capital for resilience studies. It explores social capital in disaster settings under the context of less-developed countries that have been rarely discussed in the current literature. The empirical guidance of utilizing social capital for resilience building, especially the forms of bridging and linking, fills one of the major knowledge gaps in the field. Furthermore, the application of photovoice offers rich insight about resilience studies, providing inclusive data collection as well as transparent resilience governance.

However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the role that climate variability and change play among the many drivers of migration and conflict. The overall objective of this paper is to explore the potential pathways linking climate change, migration and increased risk of conflict. We review the existing literature surrounding this issue and break the problem into two components: the links between climate change and migration, and those between migration and conflict. We found a large range of views regarding the importance of climate change as a driver for increasing rates of migration and subsequently of conflict. We argue that future research should focus not only on the climate-migration-conflict pathway but also work to understand the other pathways by which climate variability and change might exacerbate conflict. We conclude by proposing five questions to help guide future research on the link between climate change, migration, and conflict. climate change; migration; conflict;NATURAL DISASTERS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; ETHNIC-CONFLICT; ARMED CONFLICT; ADAPTATION; SECURITY; DROUGHT; WEATHER; CRISIS; IMPACT","3D mapping of lowland coastal peat domes in Indonesia Extent and thickness of peat deposits in Indonesia are poorly constrained although both are important factors in regulating peat use and in planning peat conservation. Innovations for mapping the extent and thickness of peat deposits were developed and tested on two highly disturbed peat domes on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia. Peat dome surface topography was mapped by transforming radar Digital Surface Models (DSM) to Digital Terrain Models (DTM) using ortho-photogrammetric techniques and cadastral standard Ground Control Points (GCPs). Soil core samples were collected along gradient transects to determine the peat base topography. A digital peat base model (DPBM) was generated by fitting a surface to the peat base elevation points in soil cores. Combining the peat surface DTM with the peat base DPBM provides a three-dimensional model of peat extent and thickness. Maps derived from these models can inform a 'whole of dome' approach to resolving competing land use goals, reducing regional smoke hazard and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The DPBM makes a critical contribution to accurate peat dome mapping and successful peat management on Indonesia's coastal peatlands and in any other locations where peat has formed on an undulating irregular soil surface.

"3","Bearing the risk: Learning to be drier mid-river This paper investigates learning related to the phenomena of drying over the past decade in the southern Murray-Darling Basin in Australia, as perceived in a mid-river site within the western Riverina of New South Wales, Australia. The insights from audio-recorded interviews, with a wide range of adults across the water-dependent community, mostly relate to the catchment of the Murrumbidgee River in the Shire of Hay. Our overarching theme is about how people are learning about, understanding and bearing the risks, of what is widely regarded as a prolonged drought. For some, the learning is about how to cope with less water in the Basin, and particularly from the river, as predicted in the climate change literature. Our narrative-based, empirical research registers the felt experience of those located, in situ, as a severe 'irrigation drought' extends into 2009. The paper dramatises the many obstacles to learning how to think and act differently, in difficult and rapidly changing ecosocial circumstances. nan;nan","The emerging hypercarbon reality, technological and post-carbon utopias, and social innovation to low-carbon societies Emphasis has shifted in climate change politics from fear to dreams and opportunities. This article demonstrates that many social science analyses of anthropogenic climate change are characterized by utopian presumptions, including technological mastery of nature, and that key concepts such as post-carbon society, decarbonization, low-carbon transitions, ecological direction of travel, and ecological modernization have not been defined in terms of the absolute amount of emissions appropriate for anthropogenic global warming. It shows that time-cost discounting is erroneous. These misleading conceptions give false positives for improvement and sustain wishful thinking in societies that have locked themselves into carbon-based infrastructures where default options are fossil fuels leading to an emerging path-dependent hypercarbon world. The article explains how those concepts can be reconceptualized to increase validity and also suggests accurate concepts like time-cost exacerbation, low-carbon and decarbonization transition searches, and ecological modernization niches. By comparing longue duree emitting societies, it documents the superiority of (1) social democracy over neoliberalism in transitioning to low-carbon economies while enhancing democracy, equity, and prosperity, and (2) multitasking of international mitigation commitments with local mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. The article seeks to stimulate research into learning from better performing societies to innovate transitions of institutions and culture to robustly defined low-carbon economies. Resume La priorite des politiques en matiere de changement climatique s'est reorientee de la peur aux reves, en mettant l'accent sur les opportunites. Cet article montre que de nombreuses analyses des changements climatiques d'origine anthropique, proposees par les sciences sociales, se caracterisent par des presomptions utopiques telles que la maitrise technologique de la nature et que des concepts importants comme la societe post-carbone, la decarbonisation, la transition vers de faibles emissions de carbone, l'orientation ecologique des voyages et la modernisation ecologique n'ont pas ete definis en termes de quantites absolues d'emissions appropriees au rechauffement anthropique de la planete.

Ces conceptions trompeuses presentent les faux positifs comme des ameliorations et bercent d'illusions des societes enfermees dans des infrastructures a base de carbone, oU les combustibles fossiles sont les options par defaut, menant a un monde hyper-carbone et dependant de ces nouvelles orientations. Cet article explique comment ces concepts peuvent etre redefinis pour ameliorer leur validite et suggere egalement certains concepts precis comme l'exacerbation du cout-temps, les recherches de la transition vers les faibles emissions de carbone et la decarbonisation et les niches de la modernisation ecologique. En comparant les societes emettrices de carbone sur une longue duree, l'article met en evidence la superiorite de i) la social democratie sur le neo-liberalisme dans la transition vers des economies a faibles emissions de carbone et ii) du mode de fonctionnement multitache des engagements internationaux en faveur des actions locales de reduction, d'adaptation et de resilience.

Resumen En las politicas de cambio climatico, el enfasis se ha desplazado del miedo a los suenos y oportunidades. En este articulo se demuestra que muchos analisis de las ciencias sociales sobre el cambio climatico antropogenico se caracterizan por presunciones utopicas, incluyendo el dominio tecnologico de la naturaleza, y que los conceptos clave, como sociedad post-carbono, descarbonizacion, transiciones de bajo carbono, direccion ecologica de viajes y modernizacion ecologica no se han definido en terminos de la cantidad absoluta de emisiones apropiados para el calentamiento global antropogenico. Esto demuestra que el descuento de tiempo-costo es erronea. Estas concepciones erroneas dan falsos positivos para mejorar y mantener las ilusiones en las sociedades que se han encerrado en las infraestructuras basadas en el carbono, donde las opciones por defecto son los combustibles fosiles que conducen a un camino dependiente de mundo del hipercarbono. El articulo explica como esos conceptos pueden ser reconceptualizados para aumentar la validez y tambien sugiere conceptos precisos como exacerbacion tiempo-costo, bajas emisiones de carbono y las busquedas de transicion de descarbonizacion y nichos ecologicos de modernizacion. Mediante la comparacion de las sociedades emisoras de long duree, se documenta la superioridad de i) la democracia social sobre el neoliberalismo en la transicion a economias bajas en carbono, mientras aumenta la democracia, la equidad y la prosperidad, y ii) las multiples tareas de compromisos internacionales de mitigacion con la mitigacion local, la adaptacion y la capacidad de recuperacion.

The result of missed fire cycles is a buildup of both surface and canopy fuels in many forest ecosystems, increasing the risk of severe fire. The frequency and size of fires has increased in recent decades, as has the area burned with high severity in some ecosystems. A number of studies have examined controls on high severity fire occurrence, but none have yet determined what controls the extent of high severity fire. We developed statistical models predicting high severity area burned for the western United States and three sub-regions--the Northern Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Southwest. A simple model with maximum temperature the month of fire, annual normalized moisture deficit and location explains area burned in high severity fire in our west-wide model, with the exception of years with especially large areas burned with high severity fire: 1988, 2002. With respect to mitigation or management of high severity fire, understanding what drives extreme fire years is critical. For the sub-regional models, topography, spring temperature and snowpack condition, and vegetation condition class variables improved our prediction of high severity burned area in extreme fire years. Fire year climate is critical to predicting area burned in high severity fire, especially in extreme fire years. These models can be used for scenario analyses and impact assessments to aid management in mitigating negative impacts of high severity fire. nan;PONDEROSA PINE FORESTS; SIERRA-NEVADA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STATISTICAL-MODEL; FIRE SEVERITY; WILDFIRE; CALIFORNIA; PATTERNS; TRENDS; IMPACT","Predicting climate-driven regime shifts versus rebound potential in coral reefs Climate-induced coral bleaching is among the greatest current threats to coral reefs, causing widespread loss of live coral cover(1). Conditions under which reefs bounce back from bleaching events or shift from coral to algal dominance are unknown, making it difficult to predict and plan for differing reef responses under climate change(2). Herewe document and predict long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. Following loss of >90% live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral states, while nine reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy macroalgae. Functional diversity of associated reef fish communities shifted substantially following bleaching, returning towards pre-disturbance structure on recovering reefs, while becoming progressively altered on regime shifting reefs. We identified threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event. Recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Whether reefs were inside no-take marine reserves had no bearing on ecosystem trajectory. Although conditions governing regime shift or recovery dynamics were diverse, pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories. These findings foreshadow the likely divergent but predictable outcomes for reef ecosystems in response to climate change, thus guiding improved management and adaptation. nan;GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; FISH COMMUNITIES; PHASE-SHIFTS; INDIAN-OCEAN; STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY; RECOVERY; RESILIENCE; ECOSYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT","Assessment of big floods in the Eastern Black Sea Basin of Turkey In this study, general knowledge and some details of the floods in Eastern Black Sea Basin of Turkey are presented. Brief hydro-meteorological analysis of selected nine floods and detailed analysis of the greatest flood are given. In the studied area, 51 big floods have taken place between 1955-2005 years, causing 258 deaths and nearly US $500,000,000 of damage. Most of the floods have occurred in June, July and August. It is concluded that especially for the rainstorms that have caused significantly damages, the return periods of the rainfall heights and resultant flood discharges have gone up to 250 and 500 years, respectively. A general agreement is observed between the return periods of rains and resultant floods. It is concluded that there has been no significant climate change to cause increases in flood harms. The most important human factors to increase the damage are determined as wrong and illegal land use, deforestation and wrong urbanization and settlement, psychological and technical factors. Some structural and non-structural measures to mitigate flood damages are also included in the paper. Structural measures include dykes and flood levees. Main non-structural measures include flood warning system, modification of land use, watershed management and improvement, flood insurance, organization of flood management studies, coordination between related institutions and education of the people and informing of the stakeholders.

Climate change will affect the timing and quantity of water available in the environment as well as have an adverse effect on the quality of that water. Floods, droughts, and changing patterns of water scarcity-when water is not available in sufficient enough quantities or of a suitable quality at the right time to fulfill demand-are all critical factors when considering how and where Indiana will be able to economically develop in the future. Management of water resources will become even more important as different sectors try to minimize the risk of water scarcity in the face of increasing climate variability. This paper focuses on observed changes to Indiana's water resources and how the availability and quality of those resources are likely to change in the face of future climate. Generally, Indiana is becoming wetter but with the projected increase coming primarily in the winter and spring. Summer water use will increase the likelihood of water shortages and the need for improved water management. In particular, Indiana may benefit from investment in methods to increase short-term storage of water-retaining more of the overabundance from winter and spring to relieve summer shortages.

The three subunits NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC are represented by single genes in yeast and mammals. However, in model plant species (Arabidopsis and rice) multiple genes encode each subunit providing the impetus for the investigation of the NF-Y transcription factor family in wheat. A total of 37 NF-Y and Dr1 genes (10 NF-YA, 11 NF-YB, 14 NF-YC and 2 Dr1) in Triticum aestivum were identified in the global DNA databases by computational analysis in this study. Each of the wheat NF-Y subunit families could be further divided into 4-5 clades based on their conserved core region sequences. Several conserved motifs outside of the NF-Y core regions were also identified by comparison of NF-Y members from wheat, rice and Arabidopsis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that some of the wheat NF-Y genes were expressed ubiquitously, while others were expressed in an organ-specific manner. In particular, each TaNF-Y subunit family had members that were expressed predominantly in the endosperm. The expression of nine NF-Y and two Dr1 genes in wheat leaves appeared to be responsive to drought stress. Three of these genes were up-regulated under drought conditions, indicating that these members of the NF-Y and Dr1 families are potentially involved in plant drought adaptation. The combined expression and phylogenetic analyses revealed that members within the same phylogenetic clade generally shared a similar expression profile. Organ-specific expression and differential response to drought indicate a plant-specific biological role for various members of this transcription factor family.

Given the rising living standard, population growth and global warming, energy saving techniques have been recently adopted in the framework of high performance buildings, also known as near zero-energy buildings. This is particularly true for Egypt since over the past decade, the energy consumption has witnessed an unprecedented increase particularly for the buildings sector whose share in the electricity consumption can reach 66%-74%. Hence, it is timely for Egypt to upgrade its building construction code by mandating energy rationalization. This work investigates the effects of applying energy rationalization for a non-residential building in Egypt. As a case study, the Mechanical Engineering Department building at the Faculty of Engineering Campus of Ain Shams University, was modelled using EnergyPlus as a typical educational building. A number of retrofitting strategies and energy saving techniques have been assessed and compared to reach an optimized building envelope with minimum energy needs (energy rationalization). Retrofitting the building walls resulted in a significant contribution to the energy saving (>20%). Combining various building envelope retrofitting strategies dropped the building energy consumption by more than (>36%). Furthermore, using energy efficient measures by upgrading the mechanical HVAC systems used to condition the retrofitted building led to energy savings of more than 50% and a drop in the system capacity by more than 65%. Subsequently, a solar PV system is sized to cover these rationalized energy needs with a payback period of 4-5 years, thus transforming the sample building with annual energy use intensity (EUI) of - 230 kWh/m(2) into a near zero-energy building with an EUI of -106 kWh/m(2).

This paper analyses Uganda's policies and laws, with the purpose of determining whether the policy issue, objectives of policies and laws provide for a supportive environment for REDD+ activities. The policies and laws analyzed include those indicated in Uganda's Readiness preparedness proposal and any other relevant public policies. The following questions guided the analysis: Are the REDD+ activities as prescribed in proceedings of the 16th COP to UNFCCC recognized in the policy issue and characterized? Are the REDD+ activities reflected in the object and subsequent provisions of the laws reviewed? From the analysis, it was found that deforestation and forest degradation, loss of protected areas, failure to sustainably utilize natural forests, and limited implementation of forest enhancement activities are recognized as a policy issue in some but not all policies. The characterization of deforestation and forest degradation is mostly linked to proximate drivers while barriers to conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks is linked to underlying drivers. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation are the most provided for activities in the policy issue and characterization, while enhancement of forest carbon stocks and sustainable management of forests are the least considered. Reducing forest degradation and conservation of forest stocks are the most provided for in the object and subsequent provisions of the Laws, while enhancement of forest carbon stocks is the least. Conservation of forest carbon stocks and reducing forest degradation are reflected in both policy issue and laws. The current policy and legal framework is suitable mainly for addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation as well as addressing the barriers to conservation of forest stocks.

Sources of data: Data sources are wide ranging including the Global Burden of Disease, the Commonwealth Fund and Public Health England reports. Areas of agreement: There is a high burden of preventable disease and unacceptable inequalities in England. There is considerable expectation that there are gains to be made in preventing ill health and disability and so relieving demand on healthcare. Areas of controversy: Despite agreement on the need for prevention, the Government has cut public health budgets by a cumulative 10% to 2020. Public health professionals broadly supportive of remaining in the EU face an uphill battle to retain health, workplace and environmental protections following the ` Leave' vote. Growing points and areas timely for developing research: There is revitalized interest in air pollution. Extreme weather events are testing response and organizational skills of public health professionals and indicating the need for greater advocacy around climate change, biodiversity and protection of ecological systems.

The theoretical model was established to analyze the performance of parallel two-stage evaporative strategy regarding the coefficient of performance (COP), exergy loss, exergy efficiency in comparisons with series system. And refrigerants R290 and R600 with low global warming potential (GWP) and no ozone depletion potential (ODP) are proposed as alternative refrigerants for R134a in two systems. The results show that compared with R134a, the proposed R600 has better performance with higher specific refrigerating capacity and coefficient of performance, of which specific refrigerating capacity increase 102.72% than that of R134a on average. Series two-stage evaporative strategy for vapor compression refrigeration cycle with R600 had the optimal techno-economic performance, which COP and exergy efficiency are 7.8% and 11% higher than that of parallel two-stage evaporative strategy, respectively.

This commentary builds upon the analytical distinctions of resilience provided by Urquiza et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001508.). In response to this article, we emphasize several distinctions between resilience and other systems concepts. These include distinctions between resilience, risk, and vulnerability, the tradeoff between resilience and efficiency, resilience contrasted with robustness, the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and finally methods for building resilience-by-design or resilience-by-intervention. Improving understanding of these concepts will enable planners to select resilience strategies that best support their system goals. We use examples from the 2020-2021 coronavirus pandemic to illustrate the concepts and the juxtapositions between them. Plain Language Summary This commentary builds upon the discussion of resilience in Urquiza et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001508). We discuss several distinctions related to resilience, both in urban contexts and the broader resilience literature. These include resilience versus risk and vulnerability, resilience versus efficiency, resilience versus robustness, and resilience versus sustainability. Finally, we contrast resilience-by-design with resilience-by 64 intervention. Understanding the differences between these concepts can help planners select strategies that best support their system goals.

To date, only 6 CDM projects have been registered in PICs, highlighting the 'lose-lose' business case that applies to this type of project development. This paper identifies constraints on and opportunities for CDM project development in PICs, and proposes a range of specific policy reform measures that could alter existing negative investment profiles. Key findings are that small-scale agricultural projects providing renewable energy from existing sources of biomass (currently seen as waste) are ideal candidates for CDM investment in PICs, and that the single most important reform to facilitate CDM activity and contribute to achieving the MDGs would be the implementation of a regional approach to CDM administration, in which a regional body became the designated CDM Authority for all states in the region. This would offset investment risk, improve governance transparency, and facilitate a targeted approach to sustainable development activities in the Pacific region.

In the present work, the succession of phytoplankton community inferred from sedimentary pigments has been investigated; the impacts of climate and anthropogenic activities on the succession have been evaluated by the generalized additive models (GAMs) in a shallow eutrophied lake, Lake Chaohu, located eastern China. The results show that phytoplankton succession can be divided into two periods: pre-1960s and post 1960s. The mean values of beta beta Car and Chl a increased after the 1960s at both sites sampled, from 0.013 to 0.359, and 0.013 to 1.382 mu g g(-1), respectively (site C4), and from 0.015 to 0.530, and 0.010 to 0.921 mu g g(-1), respectively (site C14), reflecting significant increases of primary productivity since the 1960s. The percentage of diatoms and dinoflagellates preserved in sediments decreased from similar to 90% to similar to 15% since the 1960s, while cyanobacteria and green algae increased from similar to 5% to similar to 35%, respectively, reflecting the shift of the lake phytoplankton community. This succession was related to construction of the Chaohu Dam in 1963, increasing discharges of anthropogenic N and P into the Lake, and a generally warming environment as reflected by increasing average air temperatures. The results of GAMs showed aquatic total phosphorus (TP) concentration is the dominant contributor to phytoplankton community change, explaining 42.74%, 40.27%, 40.77% and 72.28% of the variance of total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae, and diatoms and dinoflagellates, respectively. The positive impacts of increasing TP concentrations on abundances of total algae, cyanobacteria, and green algae were observed during periods of relatively high TP concentrations since the mid-1970s. The positive responses of total algae, cyanobacteria, green algae and diatoms and dinoflagellates to increasing average air temperatures were observed since the mid-1990s, showing that a generally warmer environment facilitated algae proliferation.

Methods Data ondaily number of deaths and meteorological variables over the period of 2011-2014 were collected. Cold spells or heat waves were defined as >= 3 consecutive days with mean temperature <= 5th percentile or >= 95th percentile, respectively. We applied a time-series adjusted Poisson regression to assess the effects of extreme temperature on deaths. Results There were 152 150 non-accidental deaths over the study period in Jinan, among which 87 607 people died of cardiovascular disease, 11 690 of respiratory disease, 33 001 of stroke and 6624 of chronic obstrutive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cold spells significantly increased the risk of deaths due to non-accidental mortality (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.11), cardiovascular disease (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.10), respiratory disease (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.27), stroke (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17) and COPD (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.38). Heat waves significantly increased the risk of deaths due to non-accidental mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.05), cardiovascular disease (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06) and stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13). The elderly were more vulnerable during heat wave exposure; however, vulnerability to cold spell was the same for the whole population regardless of age and gender.

Study findings will aid the development of future MSWM systems in Harare. A1 and A2 considered the landfilling and incineration, respectively, of indiscriminately collected MSW with energy recovery and byproduct treatment. Source-separated biodegradables were anaerobically treated with the remaining non-biodegradable fraction being incinerated in A3 and landfilled in A4. A5 and A6 had the same processes as in A3 and A4, respectively, except the inclusion of the recovery of 20% of the recoverable materials. The life cycle stages considered were collection and transportation, materials recovery, anaerobic digestion, landfilling and incineration. A5 emerged as the best option. Materials recovery contributed to impact potential reductions across the four impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed that doubling materials recovery and increasing it to 28% under A5 resulted in zero eutrophication and acidification, respectively. Increasing material recovery to 24% and 26% under A6 leads to zero acidification and eutrophication, respectively.

Since 1986, the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) between the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the United States allows Marshall Islands citizens to freely enter, lawfully reside, and work in the United States, and provides the United States exclusive military control of the region. When the COFA was signed, COFA migrants were eligible for Medicaid and other safety net programs. However, these migrants were excluded from benefits as a consequence of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act. Currently, COFA migrants have limited access to health care benefits in the United States, which perpetuates health inequalities. nan;FALL-OUT RADIATION; NUCLEAR TEST-SITE; BIKINI ATOLL; HEPATITIS-B; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESETTLEMENT OPTIONS; DOSE ASSESSMENTS; THYROID-NODULES; RONGELAP ATOLL; HUMAN-BEINGS","Does Climate Change Influence Guest Loyalty at Alpine Winter Destinations? Research has dealt extensively with different aspects of climate change and winter tourism such as the impact on ski resorts and ski lift operators, adaptation strategies, governance at destinations and reactions of winter sports guests to changing snow conditions. This paper goes deeper into the question of destination choice and examines the role of climate change among the many factors affecting guest loyalty at Alpine winter destinations. The study uses an established destination choice model with choice sets, destination image and dynamic feedback loop. A qualitative online forum identifies factors influencing winter destination choice, followed by a quantitative survey which compares Alpine winter holidaymakers categorised as loyal, disloyal and undecided. The results demonstrate that climate change clearly influences destination choice, but snow sports are not the only affected attractors. Enjoyment of the natural environment and value for money are just as high on the list of guest motivators. This indicates that climate change adaptation measures such as snowmaking can be counterproductive to guest loyalty because they spoil the natural scenery and raise prices. The paper concludes with a recommendation for winter destinations to prioritize conservation of the natural environment and integrate more environmental protection measures into their management strategies. climate change; destination choice; destination loyalty; winter tourism; ski resorts; climate adaptation; Alpine tourism;ARTIFICIAL SNOW PRODUCTION; HEDONIC PRICE MODEL; CONSUMER-BEHAVIOR; LIFT TICKETS; SKI INDUSTRY; TOURISM; SNOWMAKING; IMAGE; DEMAND; ALPS","Uncertainties in long-term drought characteristics over the Canadian Prairie provinces, as simulated by the Canadian RCM Projected changes to the severity, frequency and duration of long-term droughts for 47 watersheds in the Canadian Prairie provinces, as well as uncertainties associated with the lateral boundary forcing data and choice of drought index are explored using an ensemble of Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations for current (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) climates. Drought characteristics are defined using 2 drought indices: the precipitation anomaly based Drought Severity Index (DSI) and the more complex Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Forty-seven watersheds were subjectively classified as northern (15) and southern (32) watersheds to examine regional differences. Comparison of CRCM simulated drought characteristics with those observed suggests that the model has difficulties in reproducing observed severity, frequency and duration of drought events, particularly those based on PDSI. Projections show a decrease in severity, frequency and duration of long-term droughts for the majority of the northern watersheds, and an increase for the southern watersheds for DSI-based drought, while the majority of the 47 watersheds experience increasingly severe and prolonged droughts according to PDSI-based assessment. Uncertainties associated with the choice of drought index are larger for the northern watersheds compared to the southern watersheds. For DSI-based drought uncertainties associated with the CRCM, driving data are larger for southern watersheds only, whereas for PDSI-based drought the uncertainties are large for most watersheds. In general, uncertainty associated with the choice of drought index is as important as uncertainty in the CRCM simulated data. Nevertheless, a trivariate classification based on changes to various drought characteristics derived from the ensemble mean of CRCM simulations shows worsening DSI-based drought for southern watersheds and worsening PDSI-based drought for the entire Praries, thus posing challenges for regional water resource management.

This new climate urbanism invites to reimagine what it means to be urban in a climate-changed world. We propose the articulation of climate urbanism as a critical theory that both exposes the production of further inequalities associated with urban responses to climate change and provides new radical forms of practice for more progressive urban futures under climate change.

Currently, we are facing a crisis: a double burden of both undernutrition and overweight and obesity compounded with food insecurity in many countries. In an increasingly globalized world and interconnected food system, subjected to the pressures of growing populations, climate variability and food price volatility, no country or population is immune to the challenges that lay ahead. While unsettling, we now have more information, both in science and in practice, on how to improve the global food system. The solutions are inherently trans-sectoral, engaging practitioners and experts across agriculture, rural development and public health. Improvements can be driven by resilient food system approaches to ensure better utilization of food and dietary diversity and quality. Strengthening Food systems should be complemented with engagement of the public health and the water, sanitation and hygiene systems to ensure adequate food and nutrition security, health and wellbeing for all.

Developing countries, especially small island nations, pressed for the 1.5 degrees C target to be adopted, but who will suffer the largest changes in climate if we miss this target? Here we show that exceeding the 1.5 degrees C global warming target would lead to the poorest experiencing the greatest local climate changes. Under these circumstances greater support for climate adaptation to prevent poverty growth would be required. climate change; Paris Agreement; 1; 5 degrees C; 2 degrees C; time of emergence;DEGREES-C","Low genetic polymorphism in the re-introduced Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) population in Finland: implications for conservation Background Reduction of genetic diversity can lead to reduced fitness of species, such as the loss of adaptability to changing environments. The native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) was hunted to extinction from Finland and many other countries in Europe in the nineteenth century. In Finland, the species was re-introduced in the 1930s with only a few individuals from Norway. Re-introductions were performed also in other countries of northern Europe and as a result, Eurasian beaver populations have undergone population bottlenecks leading to low levels of genetic diversity. Materials and Methods Here, 200 Eurasian beaver samples from Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Russian Karelia were investigated using 12 microsatellite markers to examine the level of genetic diversity and relationship between the populations. Results While Russian and Estonian populations were genetically the closest, the Finnish population was clearly distinct from all others and had the lowest genetic variability among the study populations. This may be deleterious to the population especially in a changing environment. Conclusions Genetic rescue could be the best solution to increase the genetic diversity and improve the future prospects of the population, although more studies are required to resolve the optimal source population.

The analysis builds upon prior work (Mac Kinnon et al., 2018) positing that a cause-based, marginal approach to estimating methane emission impacts of reducing or increasing natural gas use was more accurate than assuming that methane emission vary one-for-one with throughput. The goal of this work is to determine the relationship between methane emissions and changes in throughput both over short time horizons where the gas infrastructure is fixed and over time periods where system expansion (or retirement) and technological improvements via component replacement occur. The results show that methane emissions change with throughput but the relative change in emissions is less than the relative change in throughput. There are many components (emissions sources) in the natural gas system that emit the same amount of methane to the atmosphere regardless of their operational mode; meaning some emissions sources have no or only partial dependence on throughput. As a result, reducing natural gas consumption in the future will not yield a directly proportional reduction in the methane emissions. It is believed that the results of this study will help energy policymakers to understand better the effect of policies aimed at reducing natural gas use on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and where such policies should be applied (e.g. system operator or end user).

This study attempts to develop a new composite drought vulnerability index (CDVI) comprising both crop and dairy indicators for 30 districts of Tamil Nadu, India. The computation of index was based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approach using exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Initially, indicators were normalized to make sure that all the indicators are comparable and weights were assigned to each indicator based on principal component analysis. Then, the districts were classified as high, moderate and less vulnerable on the basis of magnitude of the index. Coimbatore has the highest exposure to drought vulnerability (0.58) and the lowest was in Krishnagiri (0.35). In case of sensitivity, the highest was in Kancheepuram (0.69), while the lowest was in Tiruppur (0.26). The highest adaptive capacity was observed in Nagapattinam (0.52) and the lowest was in Tiruppur (0.24). None of the districts had higher adaptive capacity than sensitivity and exposure, combinedly. Overall, CDVI was highest in Kanchipuram (0.88), lowest in Erode (0.45) and moderate in Thanjavur (0.73). District level vulnerability mapping showed that twelve districts were categorized as highly vulnerable to drought; eight districts as moderately vulnerable; and ten districts as less vulnerable. Most of the districts in north eastern and southern agro-climatic zones; a few districts in Cauvery delta and western zones of Tamil Nadu had come under high vulnerable category, while a majority of the districts in north western, western and high rainfall zones were less vulnerable. To mitigate drought vulnerability, government should focus and aid in developing regional level adaptation strategies such as water conserving techniques/farm pond and appropriate policy measures to safeguard the livelihood from agriculture and dairying. Also, special attention may be given to local people's understandings about drought including traditional practices to cope-up vulnerability.

The aim of this study was to develop high-yielding, direct-seeded adapted varieties utilizing biparental to multiparental crosses involving as many as six different parents in conventional breeding programs and 12 parents in genomics-assisted breeding programs. The rigorous single plant selections were followed from the F-2 generation onwards utilizing phenotypic selection and quantitative trait locus (QTL)/gene-based/linked markers for tracking the presence of desirable alleles of targeted QTL/genes. In conventional breeding, multiparent lines had significantly higher yields (2,072-6,569 kg ha(-1)) than the biparental lines (1,493-6,326 kg ha(-1)). GAB lines derived from multiparent crosses had significantly higher (3,293-6,719 kg ha(-1)) yields than the multiparent lines from conventional breeding (2,072-6,569 kg ha(-1)). Eleven promising lines from genomics-assisted breeding carrying 7-11 QTL/genes and eight lines from conventional breeding with grain-yield improvement from 727 to 1,705 kg ha(-1) and 68 to 902 kg ha(-1), respectively, over the best check were selected. The developed lines may be released as varieties/parental lines to develop better rice varieties for direct-seeded situations or as novel breeding material to study genetic interactions. direct seeded; genomics; multiparent; QTL; genes; pyramiding; Oryza sativa;BACTERIAL-BLIGHT RESISTANCE; BROWN PLANTHOPPER RESISTANCE; NEAR-ISOGENIC LINES; GRAIN-YIELD; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; MOLECULAR ANALYSIS; RECESSIVE GENE; SELECTION; DROUGHT; QTLS","Probabilistic Projection of Mean Sea Level and Coastal Extremes Fundamental uncertainties governing sea level rise projections are associated with the rate of acceleration in global sea level rise and the local factors affecting relative sea level. Recent models and observations of global ice sheets and their contributions to sea level, as well as climate models, suggest that significant sea level acceleration is imminent, yet observational data from tide gauges and satellites have not yet found rates consistent with some of the projections. To allow coastal planners a way to incorporate the uncertainties of acceleration, a synthesis of observed sea level data with selected distributions of acceleration and the current rate of rise is proposed to provide probabilistic estimates of future sea levels. The resulting distributions can be adopted in a risk-based framework to assess project vulnerability. As geophysical understanding of the climate-forced sea level dynamics improves, the selection and veracity of these distributions and their sea level projections will improve. As a case study, the methodology is demonstrated by application in Key West in southern Florida. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WW.1943-5460.0000154. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Here, we use gravity data and groundwater flow modeling to provide further evidence of modern recharge of the North-Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya). The rainfall-recharge relationship previously established using data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) allows to produce a time series of the cumulated recharge of the NWSAS between 1950 and 2016. This reconstruction yields a mean value of 1.3 km(3) year(-1) while a near-zero recharge is obtained using GRACE data for the current decade. According to our hydrogeological model, the recharge of the confined aquifer amounts to 0.3 km(3) year(-1), representing almost 25% of the overall recharge. Comparison with the time evolution of pumping rates reveals that unsustainable exploitation came fully into effect around 1980, causing a tremendous decline in natural outflows. We show here that the natural outflow of the deep aquifer at Gabes (Tunisia), which partly sustains the coastal aquifer of the Djeffara plain, will vanish in the coming decade, highlighting unsustainable aquifer exploitation. Current population growth and climate change projections are both leading to a degree of groundwater over-exploitation which can only become increasingly unsustainable. Only the enforced regulation of irrigation practices supported both by current oasis pilot experiments and future fully integrated hydro-economic models will be effective in limiting this evolution.

This pattern is thought to reflect trends in temperature variability: tropical ectotherms evolve to be 'thermal specialists' because their environment is thermally stable. However, the tropics are also hotter, and most physiological rates increase exponentially with temperature. Using a dataset spanning diverse ectotherms, we show that the temperature ranges ectotherms tolerate (the difference between lower and upper critical temperatures, and between optimum and upper critical temperatures) generally represents the same range of equivalent biological rates (e.g. metabolism) for cool-and warm-adapted species, and independent of latitude or elevation. This suggests that geographical trends in temperature variability may not be the ultimate mechanism underlying latitudinal and elevational trends in thermal tolerance. Rather, we propose that tropical ectotherms can perform over a narrower range of temperatures than species from higher latitudes because the tropics are hotter.

Hydroponic trials on cucumber plants with three [CO2] (400, 625, and 1200 mu mol mol(-1)) and five N supply levels (2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 mmol L-1) were conducted. When plants were in high N supply, the increase in total biomass by elevated [CO2] was 51.7% and 70.1% at the seedling and initial fruiting stages, respectively. An increase in net photosynthetic rate (Pn) by more than 60%, a decrease in stomatal conductance (Gs) by 21.2-27.7%, and a decrease in transpiration rate (Tr) by 22.9-31.9% under elevated [CO2] were also observed. High N supplies could further improve the Pn and offset the decrease of Gs and Tr by elevated [CO2]. According to the mineral concentrations and the correlation results, we concluded the main factors affecting these changes. The dilution effect was the main factor driving the reduction of all mineral elements, whereas Tr also had a great impact on the decrease of [N], [K], [Ca], and [Mg] except [P].

To contextualize whether there is climate change footprint, identification of rainfall and temperature trend at regional and local scale is helpful for designing long-term adaptation and mitigation strategies. The present study therefore aims to assess evidences of climate change presences in terms of, climate variability and trend in the wettest parts of Southwest Ethiopia. Daily and monthly historical gridded rainfall and temperature data (1983-2016) of ten stations were provided by Ethiopian National Metrological Agency. Moreover, long years historical recorded climate data of Nekemte and Bedele (1971-2020) and Sekoru (1981-2020) were used in the present study. Coefficient of variation, the Mann Kendall non-parametric statistical test and Sen's slope estimator, linear regression analysis and the precipitation concentration index were applied to detect the presence of climate change in the southwest parts of Ethiopia. In this study, the trend package of open R software employed for trend identification and rate of change per year. The results indicate that the annual rainfall has declining trend at five stations with statistically significant at one station while the mean maximum and minimum temperature shows a statistically significant increasing trend at eight and six stations, respectively. At a seasonal scale, the amount of rainfall in the main rainy season (June to August) is dominated by a downward trend (eight out of ten stations) while, the autumn season (September to November) shows an increasing trend in all stations with statistically significant at one station. The precipitation concentration index analysis revealed that inconsistent and significantly irregular precipitation is observed at six stations (60%) of the ten stations. This study concludes that the climate of the wettest parts of Ethiopia is getting warmer and the amount of rainfall in the main rainy season has declined in the vast majority of the study area.

The United Nations (UN) Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) is mandated to support developing countries' climate change responses through innovative technologies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. In order to enhance the role of the CTCN as an innovation matchmaker, it is important to explore and leverage the implementation potential of new digital technologies and their transformational impact. Thus, in this research, to engage digitalization as an innovative tool with the environment, we first explored digitalization during the climate technology transfer processes by comprehensively reviewing CTCN Technical Assistance (Digitalization Technical Assistance, D-TA) activities in three climate sectors of risk prediction, policy decision making, and resource optimization. Then, by applying analytical methodologies of in-depth interviews with major digital-climate stakeholders and a staged model for technology innovation, we propose future strategies for enhancing the role of CTCN as an innovation matchmaker in the three digitalization cases of digital collection, digital analysis, and digital diffusion. technology innovation; technology transfer; digitalization; matchmaker;nan","Disasters and Decentralisation Climate change may potentially increase the magnitude of losses from natural hazards, but the United States experience shows that the primary reason for escalating losses is policy failure. It is well known that centralised, taxpayer-funded ex post disaster relief has actually encouraged development in risky jurisdictions and also weakened incentives for ex ante precautions in such jurisdictions (moral or ""charity"" hazard). Less well known and analysed is the role played by centralised ex ante development subsidies-often masquerading as protective investment-in distorting incentives. This paper develops a simple three jurisdiction model in which homogeneous jurisdictions decide by majority vote in a centralised legislature on the centralised (federal) share of ex post loss and centralised spending an ex ante development in a Beneficiary jurisdiction, taking into account how these decisions about centralised spending impact local Beneficiary jurisdiction incentives for precautions against ex post loss. The model shows that the marginal cost of ex ante federal development spending may be greater for a Beneficiary jurisdiction than for a Contractor jurisdiction. This somewhat technical result has an observable implication: evidence that a small fraction of ex post loss in a Beneficiary jurisdiction is centrally compensated (shared across jurisdictions) is evidence that ex ante development subsidies there may be truly precautionary on net; conversely, evidence that a Beneficiary jurisdiction has a large share of its ex post hazard loss compensated by centralised disaster relief suggests that the ex ante development subsidies received by that jurisdiction did more to encourage new development and increase the amount at risk than they did to protect existing development. The model is extended to consider how ex post loss sharing impacts the demand for federally subsidised disaster insurance and other related issues.

Efforts to enhance farmers' adaptation to climate change are hindered by lack of information on how they are experiencing and responding to climate change. Therefore, this paper examines smallholder farmers' perceptions of climate change, factors influencing their perceptions, and the impacts and adaptation strategies adopted over the past three to four decades. A list of farmers was obtained from the Agricultural Marketing Cooperative Society (AMCOS) and filtered on the basis of age and farming experience. In order to explore factors influencing household perceptions of climate change, a structured questionnaire was administered to the randomly selected household heads. Data on rainfall and temperature were acquired from Lyamungo and Burka Coffee estate (Northern Highlands zone) and Mbimba and Mbinga (Southern Highlands zone) offices of the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA) with the exception of data from Burka Coffee estate, which were acquired from a private operator. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data. Farmers' perceptions were consistent with meteorological data both pointing to significant decline in rainfall and increase in temperature since 1979. Factors such as level of education, farming experience, and access to climate information influenced farmers' perception on climate change aspects. Based on these results, it is recommended to enhance timely and accurate weather information delivery along with developing institutions responsible for education and extension services provision. The focus of education or training should be on attenuating the impacts of climate change through relevant adaptation measures in each coffee-growing region.

Consequently, the processes threatening biodiversity are not halted and conservation impact-defined as the beneficial environmental outcomes arising from protection relative to the counterfactual of no intervention-is smaller than previously thought. Yet, many conservation plans still target species' representation, which can fail to lead to impact by not considering the threats they face, such as land conversion and climate change. Here we aimed to identify spatial conservation priorities that minimize the risk of land conversion, while retaining sites with high value for threatened plants at risk from climate change in the Brazilian Cerrado. We compared a method of sequential implementation of conservation actions to a static strategy applied at one time-step. For both schedules of conservation actions, we applied two methods for setting priorities: (i) minimizing expected habitat conversion and prioritizing valuable sites for threatened plants (therefore maximizing conservation impact), and (ii) prioritizing sites based only on their value for threatened plants, regardless of their vulnerability to land conversion (therefore maximizing representation). We found that scenarios aimed at maximizing conservation impact reduced total vegetation loss, while still covering large proportions of species' ranges inside PAs and priority sites. Given that planning to avoid vegetation loss provided these benefits, vegetation information could represent a reliable surrogate for overall biodiversity. Besides allowing for the achievement of two distinct goals (representation and impact), the impact strategies also present great potential for implementation, especially under current conservation policies.

If not metabolized, ROS (such as O-2 (aEuro cent a'), OHaEuro cent, H2O2, or O-1(2)) exceeds the status of antioxidants and cause damage to DNA, proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules, and finally cellular metabolism arrest. Plants are endowed with a family of enzymes called superoxide dismutases (SODs) that protects cells against potential consequences caused by cytotoxic O-2 (aEuro cent a') by catalyzing its conversion to O-2 and H2O2. Hence, SODs constitute the first line of defense against abiotic stress-accrued enhanced ROS and its reaction products. In the light of recent reports, the present effort: (a) overviews abiotic stresses, ROS, and their metabolism; (b) introduces and discusses SODs and their types, significance, and appraises abiotic stress-mediated modulation in plants; (c) analyzes major reports available on genetic engineering of SODs in plants; and finally, (d) highlights major aspects so far least studied in the current context. Literature appraised herein reflects clear information paucity in context with the molecular/genetic insights into the major functions (and underlying mechanisms) performed by SODs, and also with the regulation of SODs by post-translational modifications. If the previous aspects are considered in the future works, the outcome can be significant in sustainably improving plant abiotic stress tolerance and efficiently managing agricultural challenges under changing climatic conditions.

However, the degree of adaptation depends on adaptive capacity levels and it only takes place if the appropriate resources are present. Cross-sectional climate response models ignore this requirement. This paper adapts the Ricardian method to control for a generic territorial adaptive capacity index. The results for a sample of over 60.000 European farms show a significant non-linear positive relationship between adaptive capacity and climate responsiveness and that some regions in Europe can increase their climate responsiveness significantly. This confirms that improvement of adaptive capacity is an important policy tool to enhance adaptation.

We examined the effects of land-use (forest vs. annual cropland) and soil depth (0-10 vs. 10-30 cm) on the quality (availability of C for decomposition), structural stability (composition of C functional groups), and thermal stability (energy yield and temperature characteristics during thermal oxidation) of SOC in a hedgerow system in central Alberta, using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis methods. The SOC quality (proportion of O-alkyl C) was higher, while the proportion of H- and C-substituted aromatic C and structural stability (hydrophobicity index (HB/HI), aromaticity index (ARM), and alkyl index (A/OA)) were all lower in the forest than in the cropland. The SOC also had lower thermal stability (higher energy density and lower temperature at which 50% of the mass was lost (TG-T50)) in the forest than in the cropland. Between the two soil depths, SOC quality (proportion of N-alkyl C, O-alkyl C and di-O-alkyl C) was higher, but the proportion of H- and C-substituted aromatic C and structural and thermal stabilities were lower, within the surficial 0-10 cm layer than in the 10-30 cm soil. We conclude that while the forest land-use within the hedgerow system had a higher SOC quality, it had lower SOC structural and thermal stabilities, suggesting that SOC under the forest land-use may be more susceptible to decline under climate change or other forms of anthropogenic disturbance.

After a certain period of time, timbers tend to degrade and it becomes more and more difficult to seek cost-effective replacement hardwood sleepers. To provide a shortterm solution, many rail infrastructure managers use an interspersing method of track maintenance. The interspersed sleeper of railway tracks, which is a spot replacement of old timber sleeper with concrete or composite counterparts, is often utilised as a temporary maintenance measure for secondary railway tracks such as low-traffic lines, yards, balloon loops or siding. Reportedly, the performance of railway lines including the interspersed tracks can quickly deteriorate when the tracks are exposed to heavy rains and floods. In many cases, ballast washaway can be often seen. This study is the world first to demonstrate the effects of ballast washaway on the vulnerability assessment of interspersed railway tracks using nonlinear finite element simulations, STRAND7. Two sets of moving point loads representing a bogie along the rails have been established to investigate the worst-case, potential actions for impaired performance of sleepers and differential settlements of the track. In this study, the emphasis is placed on the effects of ballast washaway on the maximum displacement of rails and the relative track geometries (i.e. top and twist). The maximum bending actions causing the failures of the track components are also investigated. The new insights will help track engineers develop appropriate climate change adaptation methods and policies for operations of interspersed railway tracks facing extreme rainfall and flooding conditions.

I also consider the links between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, as the possible trajectories of these phenomena are as intimately bound to one another as are their root causes. Finally, I discuss some of the major critiques of the application or lack thereof of disaster risk reduction in the context of critical discussions of contemporary understandings of risk and development. nan;development; disaster; displacement and resettlement; indigenous knowledge; risk; vulnerability","The Role of Phragmites australis in Mediating Inland Salt Marsh Migration in a Mid-Atlantic Estuary Many sea level rise adaptation plans emphasize the protection of adjacent uplands to allow for inland salt marsh migration, but little empirical information exists on this process. Using aerial photos from 1930 and 2006 of Delaware Estuary coastal habitats in New Jersey, I documented the rate of coastal forest retreat and the rate of inland salt marsh migration across 101.1 km of undeveloped salt marsh and forest ecotone. Over this time, the amount of forest edge at this ecotone nearly doubled. In addition, the average amount of forest retreat was 141.2 m while the amount of salt marsh inland migration was 41.9 m. Variation in forest retreat within the study area was influenced by variation in slope. The lag between the amount of forest retreat and salt marsh migration is accounted for by the presence of Phragmites australis which occupies the forest and salt marsh ecotone. Phragmites expands from this edge into forest dieback areas, and the ability of salt marsh to move inland and displace Phragmites is likely influenced by salinity at both an estuary-wide scale and at the scale of local subwatersheds. Inland movement of salt marsh is lowest at lower salinity areas further away from the mouth of the estuary and closer to local heads of tide. These results allow for better prediction of salt marsh migration in estuarine landscapes and provide guidance for adaptation planners seeking to prioritize those places with the highest likelihood of inland salt marsh migration in the near-term. nan;SEA-LEVEL RISE; DELAWARE BAY; SEDIMENT ACCRETION; TIDAL MARSH; COMMON REED; WEST-COAST; INVASION; FOREST; CONNECTICUT; VEGETATION","Traditional Knowledge About Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus) in East Greenland: Changes in the Catch and Climate Over Two Decades In Greenland, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are nutritional, economic, and cultural subsistence resources for Inuit. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected from subsistence hunters can provide important insights and improve management decisions when collected systematically. We report on the results of a TEK survey of subsistence polar bear hunters living in the areas around Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland. Twenty-five full-time polar bear hunters were interviewed between December 2014 and March 2015 in a conversation-style interview, where a local interviewer fluent in the East Greenlandic dialect asked a series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals were to (1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence quotas and hunting strategies, (2) understand how climate change is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and (3) document observed changes in polar bear distribution, abundance, and biology. Approximately 40% of the Tasiilaq respondents had caught between 10 and 19 polar bears in their lifetime, while 67% of lttoqqortoormiit respondents reported lifetime catches of >= 20 bears. In both areas, polar bears were most commonly hunted between February and April. Hunters noted large changes to the climate in the areas where they hunt polar bears. Most hunters reported loss of sea ice, receding glaciers, unstable weather, and warmer temperatures. In Tasiilaq 73% of the hunters said climate changes had affected the polar bear hunt and in lttoqqortoormiit about 88% of respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated that sea ice loss has created more areas of open water so dog sledges have become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to 10-15 years ago (reported by 100% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80% in Ittoqqortoormiit). In lttoqqortoormiit, the distance traveled during polar bear hunting trips has decreased dramatically. In both areas hunters noted that more polar bears are coming into their communities compared to 10-15 years ago (81% of Tasiilaq hunters and 78% of Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the introduction of quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons. This study provides an important perspective on the East Greenland subpopulation of polar bears that can be used to direct science questions and inform management.

The idea that outdoor air pollution can cause exacerbations of pre-existing asthma is supported by an evidence base that has been accumulating for several decades, with several studies suggesting a contribution to new-onset asthma as well. In this Series paper, we discuss the effects of particulate matter (PM), gaseous pollutants (ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), and mixed traffic-related air pollution. We focus on clinical studies, both epidemiological and experimental, published in the previous 5 years. From a mechanistic perspective, air pollutants probably cause oxidative injury to the airways, leading to inflammation, remodelling, and increased risk of sensitisation. Although several pollutants have been linked to new-onset asthma, the strength of the evidence is variable. We also discuss clinical implications, policy issues, and research gaps relevant to air pollution and asthma. nan;DIESEL EXHAUST PARTICLES; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE EXPOSURE; GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; TOBACCO-SMOKE EXPOSURE; EXHALED NITRIC-OXIDE; LUNG-FUNCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; AMBIENT PARTICULATE","Regional capacity to govern the energy transition: The case of two Dutch energy regions In this paper we analyse how interactions between governing bodies influence Dutch energy regions' capacity to govern the energy transition. We develop an analytical framework which draws on, and merges, two different theoretical perspectives: multi-level governance and capacities for transformative climate governance. We apply this framework in an exploratory case study of the Dutch energy regions Holland Rijnland and Noordoost Brabant. Results are primarily derived using a set of interviews and desk study. Aided by the framework, we find that, while the Regional Energy Strategy (RES) arrangement is clearly geared towards facilitating orchestration through coordination and exchange of ideas and standpoints, the current governance approach, is hindered by unclear and ambiguous roles and responsibilities, a referral back to and dependence on traditional hierarchical structures, and high transaction costs. These interactions negatively influence capacity development in the regional energy transition by complicating strategic alignment and the creation of opportunity contexts.

Recent advances are both conceptual and methodological, and include analysis of some consequences of climate change that were heretofore intractable. In this article, I review a selection of these developments and represent them through a handful of illustrative cases. A key characteristic of the emerging areas of interest is a focus on understanding how human responses to direct impacts of climate change may cause important indirect and sometimes distant impacts. This realization underscores the need to develop integrated approaches for assessing and modeling impacts in an evolving socioeconomic and policy context. nan;SEA-LEVEL RISE; CROP YIELDS; LAND-USE; MIGRATION; ADAPTATION; AFRICA; MEXICO; VULNERABILITY; AGRICULTURE; INCREASES","Modeling Future Land Use Development: A Lithuanian Case Effective management decisions regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may be hampered by the lack of scientific tools for modeling future land use change. This study addresses methodological principles for land use development scenario modeling assumed for use in processes of GHG accounting and management. Associated land use policy implications in Lithuania are also discussed. Data on land uses, available from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and collected for GHG accounting from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector in the country, as well as freely available geographic information, were tested as an input for modeling land use development in the country. The modeling was implemented using the TerrSet Land Change Modeler. Calibration of the modeling approach using historical land use data indicated that land use types important for GHG management in the LULUCF sector were predicted with an accuracy above 80% during a five-year period into the future, while the prediction accuracy for forest and built-up land was 96% or more. Based on several land management scenarios tested, it was predicted that the LULUCF sector in Lithuania will accumulate CO2, with the forest land use type contributing most to CO2 absorption. Key measures to improve the GHG balance and carbon stock changes were suggested to be the afforestation of abandoned or unused agricultural land and prevention of the conversion of grassland into producing land. land use; land use change; scenario; carbon stock changes; simulation; forest; producing land; grassland;CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER CHANGE; SIMULATE; PATTERN; TOOLS","Recife: A climate action profile This paper seeks to present the main drivers for climate agenda advance in the city of Recife in Brazil, discussing how geographical characteristics and the historical urbanization process of the city have contributed to the climate risks and vulnerabilities. A city profile is designed and the literature about drivers to cities actions to climate change are used as theoretical basis. The presence of committed leaders, multilevel governance, being part of multinational cities networks and access to funding are traditional fundamental factors identified in the literature to strength climate agenda in a city which were also found in Recife. The climate risks imposed to cities with lower development level were found as important driver to climate action, unlike what previous studies showed for European cities. The article contributes evidencing factors that can decisively assist cities to strength the climate agenda, mainly in developing or less developed countries. It also provides insights for academics and policymakers about low carbon urban strategies that can be adopted by cities. This is the first city profile to address the relationship between the impacts of urban evolution in a Latin American city and the threats imposed by climate change.

In the short run, such decisions are generally not consistent with executive incentives and often not seen as profit maximizing. Nevertheless, as some climate change responses may indeed be firm value maximizing, such decisions can be expected to reflect the nature of a firm's corporate governance. Based on an analysis of 500 of the largest US firms, we show empirically that this is indeed the case. Specifically, this study documents that institutional ownership and board entrenchment seem to significantly influence climate change and environmental impact mitigation policies of large firms. ","New technologies in predicting, preventing and controlling emerging infectious diseases Surveillance of emerging infectious diseases is vital for the early identification of public health threats. Emergence of novel infections is linked to human factors such as population density, travel and trade and ecological factors like climate change and agricultural practices. A wealth of new technologies is becoming increasingly available for the rapid molecular identification of pathogens but also for the more accurate monitoring of infectious disease activity. Web-based surveillance tools and epidemic intelligence methods, used by all major public health institutions, are intended to facilitate risk assessment and timely outbreak detection. In this review, we present new methods for regional and global infectious disease surveillance and advances in epidemic modeling aimed to predict and prevent future infectious diseases threats.

An increasing number of studies have shown that ocean acidification negatively impacts the larval life-history stage, including those of echinoids which are commercially and ecologically important. However, little is known about the behavioral responses of echinoid larvae to different pH levels in the water column. Changes in vertical movement in response to the naturally occurring pH variations caused by biological activities and/or physical conditions could affect dispersal and recruitment. In this study, we quantified the vertical distribution of larval sand dollars, Dendraster excentricus (Echinodermata), in water columns with stratified layers of seawater varying in salinity and pH. When larval sand dollars swimming upwards in ambient seawater (pH(NBS) 7.86 +/- 0.04) encountered a layer of low pH (pH(NBS) 7.54 +/- 0.04) seawater, about half of the individuals (53 +/- 28%) were aggregated near the transition layer 60 min after the start of the experiment. Preliminary video analysis showed larvae reversed their direction of travel and altered the shape of their helical swimming trajectories, upon encountering the transition layer moving from ambient to low pH water. In contrast, when larval sand dollars swimming upwards in acidified seawater encountered ambient seawater, they continued to swim upward to aggregate near the top of the column. In control water columns with uniform pH, larvae did not change swimming behavior regardless of whether pH was ambient or acidified and whether salinity was uniform or stratified. These results indicate that stratification itself did not strongly affect the vertical distributions of larvae. These observations suggest that echinoid larvae, and perhaps many other types of planktonic larvae, may use behavioral plasticity to reduce exposure to stresses from ocean acidification. The presence and effectiveness of these responses may improve the ability of larvae to cope with stressful, dynamic habitats, and hence may be significant to prediction of potential impacts of global climate change. nan;MARINE INVERTEBRATE LARVAE; OCEAN-ACIDIFICATION; SAND DOLLAR; DENDRASTER-EXCENTRICUS; CARBONATE SATURATION; HALOCLINES; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; SETTLEMENT; LAYERS","Characteristics of shade trees used under Arabica coffee agroforestry systems in Mount Elgon Region, Eastern Uganda Shade trees in coffee farms are promoted worldwide for ecological sustainability and adaptation to climate change. However, contradicting reports on the effects of shade trees in coffee agroforestry systems are emanating from Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica) farmers. Therefore, this study: (1) characterized the shade trees in Arabica coffee-based agroforestry system; (2) identified the tree selection criteria used; (3) identified the sources of planting materials; and (4) determined the major factors affecting the growing of shade trees under the Arabica coffee-based system of Mount Elgon. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in randomly selected coffee farms with and without shade trees. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 107 coffee farmers. Fourteen shade tree species were recorded, and the six most abundant were: Albizia coriaria, Cordia africana, Ficus ovata, Ficus synchromonous, Maesopsis eminii and Grevillea robusta. Least abundant species were Eucalyptus species, Antiaris toxicaria, Artocarpous heterophylus, Mangifera indica and Milicia excelsa. Farmers selected shade trees which were fast growing, had small leaf sizes, with wide crowns, ever-green and of medium height. Fellow farmers were the main source of shade-tree planting materials (P <= 0.05). Barriers to shade tree use included resource competition and falling trees damaging the understorey. The results underscore the need for site-specific provision of appropriate shade tree coffee mixes and strategies by policy and development partners for transformation of shaded coffee farming landscapes and livelihoods for improved coffee production.

Natural forest regeneration can potentially play a major role in large-scale landscape restoration in tropical regions. Here, we focus on the conditions that favor natural regeneration within tropical forest landscapes. We illustrate cases where large-scale natural regeneration followed forest clearing and non-forest land use, and describe the social and ecological factors that drove these local forest transitions. The self-organizing processes that create naturally regenerating forests and natural regeneration in planted forests promote local genetic adaptation, foster native species with known traditional uses, create spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and sustain local biodiversity and biotic interactions. These features confer greater ecosystem resilience in the face of future shocks and disturbances. We discuss economic, social, and legal issues that challenge natural regeneration in tropical landscapes. We conclude by suggesting ways to enable natural regeneration to become an effective tool for implementing large-scale forest and landscape restoration. Major research and policy priorities include: identifying and modeling the ecological and economic conditions where natural regeneration is a viable and favorable land-use option, developing monitoring protocols for natural regeneration that can be carried out by local communities, and developing enabling incentives, governance structures, and regulatory conditions that promote the stewardship of naturally regenerating forests. Aligning restoration goals and practices with natural regeneration can achieve the best possible outcome for achieving multiple social and environmental benefits at minimal cost.

Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts. However, before starting determining adaptation strategies, it is important to conduct scientific research to understand possible pathways of future climate change under different emission scenarios. This is essential for having scientific facts that would guide the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. In this study, climate change projections for Tanzania is carried out using outputs of high resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX). Future (2011-2100) projections of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 are compared with baseline (1971-2000) simulations. The comparison is based on determining the departure of future climate during present (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100) centuries from baseline (1971-2000) climate condition. Results reveal that there are likely to be an obvious increased minimum and maximum temperature trend over the entire country in three future periods (2011-2040), (2041-2070), and (2071-2100) under both emission scenarios RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. This is especially true for the western parts of the country, southwestern highlands and the eastern parts of Lake Nyasa where maximum temperatures are projected to be greater than 3.5 degrees C and in the range of 2 to 2.4 degrees C under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. The western sides of the Lake Victoria basin and parts of Northeastern highlands are likely to feature increased minimum temperatures in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 degrees C under RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The cold season: June-July-August-September (JJAS) is likely to become warmer than the warm season that starts from October and continue to April or May. During JJAS season, the country is likely to experience increased maximum temperature in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 degrees C and 2 to 4 degrees C in mid (2041-2070) and end (2070-2100) centuries respectively. Rainfall over parts of northeastern highlands and Coastal regions is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm/day and 0.25 to 0.5 mm/day under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. However, the western regions, southwestern highlands and eastern side of Lake Nyasa are likely to experience decreased amount of rainfall in the range of 0.5 to 1mm/day under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios. climate change; temperature; rainfall; CORDEX; regional climate models;AFRICA; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; ABILITY; CORDEX; RAINS","Irrigation and Yield Parameters of Soybean as Effected by Irrigation Management, Soil Compaction and Nitrogen Fertilizationy Irrigation parameters (reference crop evapotranspiration, actual plant water use, amount of irrigation water, water use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency, plant water consumption coefficient, variations in soil moisture based on plant water consumption-amount of irrigation water) and yield parameters (seed yield, 1000-kernel weight, harvest index) were investigated for soybean grown in Harran Plain under conventional every-furrow and alternate-furrow irrigation management systems, three different compaction levels (control without compaction, low compaction, high compaction) and three different nitrogen levels (6, 9, 12 kg da(-1)). Experiments were carried out during 2006 and 2007 cropping seasons in Sanliurfa, Turkey in split-split plots experimental design with 3 replications. Irrigation program was created by KanSched simulation model. The amount of applied irrigation water in conventional and alternate furrow systems in 2006 and 2007 were measured as 435.61 and 291.59 mm, and 429.51 and 271.72 mm, respectively. ET values decreased with increasing compaction levels. The highest ET value (568 mm) was observed in non-compacted control treatment and the lowest value (240 mm) in high-compaction treatment. Irrigation water use efficiency increased with decreased irrigation water and the values were higher than water use efficiencies. While the highest yield (94.78 kg da(-1)) was observed in control treatment of the year 2006, conventional furrow system had the highest yield (209.93 kg da(-1)) in the year 2007. While effects of compaction and irrigation on harvest index were insignificant, nitrogen doses were found to be significant. Results revealed that KanSched irrigation model could be used for irrigation scheduling but plant coefficients to be used in the model should be determined properly based on climate conditions. Negative impacts of soil compaction in agricultural fields due to traffic and various other reasons can be eliminated with proper irrigation and fertilization implementations. However, yield losses at high-compaction levels may reach up to 45%.

Although the availability of water from this has increased over time, there is a growing gap between water demand and availability, driven mainly by growth in tourism. Closing this gap is essential, particularly in the context of adaptation to climate change. In this regard, solar-driven water desalination plants have been installed on the islands to augment RWH supplies, thus creating a hybrid system. Although, the desalinated water (DW) is highly subsidised, there is a general reluctance to embrace its availability and to pay for it. In Carriacou, the borehole supply that was used to augment rainwater in the urban area was replaced by DW, resulting in increased use of the public supply. The potential of augmenting rainwater with DW is restricted by concerns about quality, a general unwillingness to pay for the water, the strong preference for rainwater and the inability of the utility company to recover costs. The initial lessons learnt from this hybrid system can be important for developing appropriate water policies for islands that have traditionally been dependent on RWH. developing countries; sustainability; water supply;TREATMENT SYSTEMS; INFRASTRUCTURE; ISLANDS; ENERGY","Changes in streamflow regimes and their responses to different soil and water conservation measures in the Loess Plateau watersheds, China Investigating the changes in streamflow regimes in response to various influencing factors contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of hydrological processes in different watersheds and to water resource management strategies. This study examined streamflow regime changes by applying the indicators of hydrologic alteration method and eco-flow metrics to daily runoff data (1965-2016) from the Sandu, Hulu and Dali Rivers on the Chinese Loess Plateau, and then determined their responses to terracing, afforestation and damming. The Budyko water balance equation and the double mass curve method were used to separate the impacts of climate change and human activities on the mean discharge changes. The results showed that the terraced and dammed watersheds exhibited significant decreases in annual runoff. All hydrologic metrics indicated that the highest degree of hydrologic alteration was in the Sandu River watershed (terraced), where the monthly and extreme flows reduced significantly. In contrast, the annual eco-deficit increased significantly, indicating the highest reduction in streamflow among the three watersheds. The regulation of dams and reservoirs in the Dali River watershed has altered the flow regime, and obvious decreases in the maximum flow and slight increases in the minimum flow and baseflow indices were observed. In the Hulu River watershed (afforested), the monthly flow and extreme flows decreased slightly and were categorized as low-degree alteration, indicating that the long-term delayed effects of afforestation on hydrological processes. The magnitude of the eco-flow metrics varied with the alteration of annual precipitation. Climate change contributed 67.47% to the runoff reduction in the Hulu River watershed, while human activities played predominant roles in reducing runoff in the Sandu and Dali River watersheds. The findings revealed distinct patterns and causes of streamflow regime alteration due to different conservation measures, emphasizing the need to optimize the spatial allocation of measures to control soil erosion and utilize water resources on the Loess Plateau.

In Kazakhstan, one of the countries facing a serious grass-livestock conflict, maintaining its residents' demand for products of livestock resources is becoming increasingly important. To explore the characteristics of consumption of products of livestock resources in Kazakhstan and the factors that influence the consumption of these products, this paper considers data on products of livestock resources in Kazakhstan and factors such as the economic development of a region, grassland resources utilization, grassland degradation, livestock husbandry, trade balance volumes of product of livestock resources, and population distribution to obtain the following conclusions and implications. First, the most consumed product of livestock resources in Kazakhstan is milk, followed by meat and eggs; beef, in particular, accounted for the highest proportion of all meat. Second, except milk, which showed a continuous increase in consumption, other products of livestock resources showed an upward trend only after 2000, which represented a turning point. Third, the total consumption of products of livestock resources increased progressively from north to south: it is lowest in the typical grasslands, then higher in the semi-desert grasslands, and is greatest in the desert grasslands. Changes in per capita consumption were consistent with the variations in the regional livestock inventories. Fourth, the conflict between consumption and supply in desert grasslands is becoming increasingly severe. To guarantee the dynamic demand of its residents for consumption of products of livestock resources, the Kazakhstan government can make better use of grassland ecosystem resources by adjusting the structure of livestock husbandry, rotating different grasses, and introducing improved grazing animal species in a bid to maintain grassland ecosystem services and improve local residents' well-being.

In this paper, we explore the following questions: How has watershed management evolved? What new tools are available and how can they be integrated into sustainable watershed management? To address these questions, we discuss the process of developing integrated watershed management strategies for sustainable management through the incorporation of adaptive management techniques and traditional ecological knowledge. We address the numerous benefits from integration across disciplines and jurisdictional boundaries, as well as the incorporation of technological advancements, such as remote sensing, GIS, big data, and multi-level social-ecological systems analysis, into watershed management strategies. Weuse three case studies from China, Europe, and Canada to review the success and failure of integrated watershed management in addressing different ecological, social, and economic dilemmas in geographically diverse locations. Although progress has been made in watershed management strategies, there are still numerous issues impeding successful management outcomes; many of which can be remedied through holistic management approaches, incorporation of cutting-edge science and technology, and cross-jurisdictional coordination. We conclude by highlighting that future watershed management will need to account for climate change impacts by employing technological advancements and holistic, cross-disciplinary approaches to ensure watersheds continue to serve their ecological, social, and economic functions. We present three case studies in this paper as a valuable resource for scientists, resource managers, government agencies, and other stakeholders aiming to improve integrated watershed management strategies and more efficiently and successfully achieve ecological and socio-economic management objectives.

Despite progress in conservation efforts and increasing number of Indonesia's marine protected areas (MPAs), these habitats are generally still under multitude of pressures leading to declining condition. Thus, there is a growing need to improve the conservation management of seagrass habitats, especially within MPAs in Indonesia. Here, we identify five challenges on managing seagrass meadows in Indonesia's MPAs: (1) Achieving societal awareness on the importance of seagrasses in Indonesia' MPAs; (2) Achieving fair recognition from the management authority of Indonesia's MPAs; (3) Obtaining political initiatives related to laws and regulations on seagrass management; (4) Providing empirical data on seagrass habitats at national level repeated over time; and (5) Enhancing capacity to conduct community-based management of seagrasses. Then, we propose a series of solutions to solve these challenges. We believe that all stakeholders need to work collaboratively to secure the future of Indonesia's seagrass habitats and maintain their capacity to deliver significant ecosystem services.

An under-researched implication of such a transition in competitive wholesale electricity markets is that greater wind and solar generation capacity directly affects wholesale price variability. In theory, two counter-vailing forces should be at work. First, greater wind and solar generation capacity should reduce short-run variance in the wholesale electricity price due to a stochastic merit-order eject. However, increasing the generation capacity of these technologies may increase price variance due to an intermittency effect. Using an instrumental variables identification strategy to control for endogeneity, we find evidence that greater combined wind and solar generation capacity is associated with an increase in the quarterly variance of wholesale electricity prices. That is, the intermittency effect dominates the stochastic merit-order effect. ","Sensitivity of shortwave radiative flux density, forcing, and heating rate to the aerosol vertical profile The effect of the aerosol vertical distribution on the solar radiation profiles for idealized and measured profiles of extinction and single-scattering albedo (SSA) during the May 2003 Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Aerosol Intensive Observation Period (AIOP) is investigated using the rapid radiative transfer model shortwave code. Calculated profiles of downwelling and upwelling solar flux density during the AIOP are compared with the measurements from solar broadband radiometers aboard a profiling research aircraft. The profiles of aerosol extinction, SSA, and water vapor obtained from the aircraft that carried the radiometers serve as the model inputs. The uplooking radiometers were mounted on a stabilized platform that kept the radiometers parallel with respect to Earth's horizontal plane. The results indicate that the vertical shape of the aerosol extinction profiles has very little impact on the clear-sky direct radiative forcing at the top of atmosphere and surface but is important for forcing profiles of partially absorbing aerosol. The vertical distributions of absorption profiles drastically influence the forcing and heating rate profiles. Using aircraft data from 19 AIOP profiles over the southern Great Plains, we are able to achieve broadband downwelling solar flux density closure within 0.8% (bias difference) or 1.8% (RMS difference), well within the expected measurement uncertainty of 1%-3%. The poorer agreement in upwelling flux density (bias -3.7%, RMS 10%) is attributed to the use of inaccurate surface albedo data. The accurate, vertically resolved aerosol extinction data play an important role in tightening solar radiative flux density closure. This study also suggests that aircraft solar radiative flux density measurements from a stabilized platform have the potential to determine solar heating rate profiles. These measurement-based heating rate profiles provide useful data for heating rate closure studies and indirect estimates of single-scattering albedo assumed in radiative transfer calculations. nan;OPTICAL DEPTH; SAFARI 2000; CLOUD; MODIS; LIDAR; ABSORPTION; AIRCRAFT; IRRADIANCE; ATMOSPHERE; PARTICLES","A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis of the United States-Canada 2006 Sofiwood Lumber Agreement We use a global dynamic multiregional computable general equilibrium model to analyze the comparative economic impacts of the 2006 softwood lumber agreement between Canada and the United States over the 2007-2013 period and the extent to which Canadian Provinces made a favorable choice of export tax border measure options. Results show that the agreement was effective in curtailing Canada's softwood lumber entry into the United States market. It benefited the United States producers through increased stumpage rates, whereas the United States consumers lost marginally in welfare due to increased price index while gaining in household income. Canadian producers compensated for their loss of market share in the United States by redirecting their exports to rest of the world market. All Canadian Provinces except Saskatchewan and Ontario made a favorable choice of the export tax border measure options from a consumer welfare perspective. However, alternative export border control measure choices could have had more favorable impacts on other economic variables in these and other Provinces. computable general equilibrium; softwood lumber dispute; export tax; export quota; economic impacts;CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; TRADE; RESTRICTIONS; DISPUTE; MARKET; SECTOR","Genomics of Developmental Plasticity in Animals Developmental plasticity refers to the property by which the same genotype produces distinct phenotypes depending on the environmental conditions under which development takes place. By allowing organisms to produce phenotypes adjusted to the conditions that adults will experience, developmental plasticity can provide the means to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Developmental plasticity can be adaptive and its evolution can be shaped by natural selection. It has also been suggested that developmental plasticity can facilitate adaptation and promote diversification. Here, we summarize current knowledge on the evolution of plasticity and on the impact of plasticity on adaptive evolution, and we identify recent advances and important open questions about the genomics of developmental plasticity in animals. We give special attention to studies using transcriptomics to identify genes whose expression changes across developmental environments and studies using genetic mapping to identify loci that contribute to variation in plasticity and can fuel its evolution. developmental plasticity; reaction norms; environmentally responsive genes; genomics of plasticity; plasticity variation;GENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; CRYPTIC GENETIC-VARIATION; ADAPTIVE PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; UNDERLYING WING POLYPHENISM; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; REACTION NORMS; BODY-SIZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DROSOPHILA PIGMENTATION; SEASONAL PLASTICITY","Impact of Sowing Dates on Terminal Heat Tolerance of Different Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Cultivars Terminal heat stress leads to significant yield reduction in wheat. Adaptation strategies to combat this could be either growing heat-tolerant cultivars or adjustments in sowing date. A study was conducted for 2 years to understand the impact of terminal heat stress on wheat using three different wheat cultivars (HD 2932, WR 544 and HD 2967) and three sowing date, viz. D-1 (second week of November), D-2 (first week of December) and D-3 (last week of December) at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, India. Results revealed that timely sown crop (D1) showed significantly higher number of tillers m(-2) (450), plant height (93.5 cm), 1000-grain weight (38 g), grain yield (6.3 t ha(-1)) and harvest index (0.44) compared with D2 and D3. Yield loss occurred by 70, 29 and 77 kg ha(-1) per day due to delay in sowing beyond D-1 in varieties, viz. 'HD 2932,' 'WR 544' and 'HD 2967,' respectively. The late-sown crop resulted lower yield, which encountered higher temperature in its terminal growth stages. Among three varieties used, 'WR 544' had lesser decline in growth and yield than other two varieties due to late sowing. It implied that 'WR 544' had thermotolerant characteristics. Higher yield in wheat requires both heat-tolerant cultivars and better agronomic strategy under terminal heat stress condition. This study concluded that varietal selection and adjustment in sowing date could be the appropriate adaptation strategies under changing climate especially the terminal heat stress.

Capsule: Current UK distributions of non-native birds poorly match areas identified as being climatically suitable. Aims: Non-native species are spreading at unprecedented rates and though invasions are expected to increase under climate change, evidence for this is mixed. We assess climatic suitability throughout the UK based on the apparent match to the climate in species' native ranges and investigate potential climatic limitation within the non-native range. Methods: Climate was characterized within polygons representing the native ranges of 167 potentially invasive species. Parts of the UK with current and future climate similar to that in the native range were deemed climatically suitable. The incidence of recent observations inside and outside suitable areas was used to test hypotheses about climatic limitation of non-native ranges. Results: Climate matching suggests that 69 of 167 non-native bird species could currently find climatically suitable areas for establishment in the UK. Future climate change would see this number increase by 14% by 2080. However, observed occurrences of non-native species in the UK were not significantly correlated to climatic suitability. Only 44 of the 69 species with suitable climate in the UK were present. Moreover, 85% of species observed in the UK had some UK occurrences in climatically unsuitable areas and for 57 species their entire UK range was in climatically unsuitable areas. Similar results were apparent for the subset of 12 species with established UK populations. Conclusions: Climate matching provides a relatively poor indication of the extent of current and future suitable areas because species can adapt to new climates or other factors constrain the native range and many climatically suitable areas are currently unoccupied. Improvements to climate matching techniques and ongoing surveillance are required to refine predictions to support effective management policies. nan;NICHE CONSERVATISM; PLANT INVASIONS; GLOBAL CHANGE; RANGE; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; SUCCESS; MODELS; SHIFTS; SPACE","MAIZE YIELD AND ITS STABILITY AS AFFECTED BY TILLAGE AND CROP RESIDUE MANAGEMENT IN THE EASTERN ROMANIAN DANUBE PLAIN Rainfed crop management systems need to be optimized to provide more resilient options in order to cope with projected climatic scenarios, which forecast a decrease in mean precipitation and more frequent extreme drought periods in the Eastern Romanian Danube Plain. This research, carried out in the period of 2011-2014, had as main purpose the determination of influence of tillage practices and residue management on rainfall use efficiency, maize yield and its stability, in order to evaluate the advantages of conservation agriculture (CA) in the time of stabilization of direct seeding effects, in comparison with traditional chisel tillage. The maize grain yields are presented for each crop management practices, as follows: (1) chisel tillage, retained crop residues being chopped and incorporated (ciz); (2) zero tillage, retained crop residue chopped and kept on the field in short flat condition (rvt); (3) zero tillage, crop residues kept on the field in short root-anchored condition (1/2rva), and (4) zero tillage, crop residues kept on the field in tall root-anchored condition (1/1rva). In 2012, a year with prolonged drought during vegetative growth, yield differences between zero tillage with short root-anchored residue retention (1/2rva) and chisel tillage with residue incorporation (ciz) were positive, up to 840 kg ha(-1). On average over 2011-2014, conservation agriculture (CA) practices had a yield advantage over traditional chisel tillage practice. Zero tillage with residue retention used rainfall more efficiently, suggesting that it is a more resilient agronomic system than traditional (conventional) practices involving chisel tillage with residue incorporation. conservation agriculture; crop residues; zero-tillage; yield stability;nan","Connecting Climate Information Producers and Users: Boundary Organization, Knowledge Networks, and Information Brokers at Caribbean Climate Outlook Forums Boundary organizations, knowledge networks, and information brokers have been suggested as mechanisms that help integrate information into decision-making and enhance interactions between the producers and users of climate information. While these mechanisms have been discussed in many studies in disparate fields of research, there has been little empirical research describing how they relate and support each other within studies on climate services. In this paper, two Caribbean Regional Climate Outlook Forums (CariCOFs) convened in 2014 are studied. CariCOFs facilitate the production of regional seasonal climate information and the dissemination of it to a diverse climate and socioeconomic region. Network analysis, key informant interviews, and small group discussions were used to answer two questions: 1) what are the barriers to using seasonal climate forecasts (SCFs) by CariCOF participants and 2) what are the iterative processes of information exchange that address these barriers? The barriers to using SCF include difficulty in demonstrating the value of the forecast to potential users, difficulty in interpreting and explaining the forecast to others, and challenges associated with the scientific language used in the information. To address these constraints, the convener of the CariCOF acts as a boundary organization by enabling interactions between participants representing diverse sectoral and geographic settings. This develops a network that helps build shared scientific understanding and knowledge about how different sectors experience climate risk. These interactions guide information brokering activities that help individuals communicate and translate climate information to facilitate understanding at local levels.

Future climate change scenarios for time periods in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s were projected by downscaling the outputs of the General Circulation Model (GCM), Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3) A2 and B2 scenarios. The AquaCrop model was used to simulate the impact of future climates on rice yield. The minimum and maximum temperature of the province is projected to increase by 0.35-1.72 A degrees C and 0.93-3.69 A degrees C respectively in future. Similarly, the annual precipitation is expected to increase by 9.75 % in the 2080s. Results show that climate change will reduce rice yield from 1.29 to 23.05 % during the winter season for both scenarios and all time periods, whereas an increase in yield by 2.07 to 6.66 % is expected in the summer season for the 2020s and 2050s; relative to baseline yield. The overall decrease of rice yield in the winter season can be offset, and rice yield in the summer season can be enhanced to potential levels by altering the transplanting dates and by introducing supplementary irrigation. Late transplanting of rice shows an increase of yield by 20-27 % in future. Whereas supplementary irrigation of rice in the winter season shows an increase in yield of up to 42 % in future. Increasing the fertilizer application rate enhances the yield from 0.3 to 29.8 % under future climates. Similarly, changing the number of doses of fertilizer application increased rice yield by 1.8 to 5.1 %, relative to the current practice of single dose application. Shifting to other heat tolerant varieties also increased the rice production. Based on the findings, changing planting dates, supplementary irrigation, proper nutrient management and adopting to new rice cultivars can be beneficial for the adaptation of rice cultivation under climate change scenarios in central Vietnam.

Application of Marxan model in the Czech Republic The joint impact of human activities and climate change on natural resources lead to biodiversity loss. Therefore, it is important to select protected areas through systematic conservation planning. The present study assessed how representative natural habitats are protected under the nature conservation network, and to identify new-but so far insufficiently-protected areas containing these habitats for sustainable management. We used the Marxan model to select the most valuable insufficiently protected natural habitats in the Czech Republic as a representative example for a conservation strategy for Central-Eastern European environments. We set three conservation targets (25%, 50%, and 75%), defining how much percent area of valuable representative natural habitats should be added to the area of the habitats already included in the Nature Protection Network. To implement these conservation targets it is necessary to preserve 22,932 ha, 72,429, ha and 124,363 ha respectively of the conservation targets occurring in the insufficiently protected areas, and 17,255 ha, 51,620 ha, and 84,993 ha respectively of the conservation features in the areas without protection status. Marxan was revealed to be an appropriate tool to select the most valuable and insufficiently protected natural habitats for sustainable management. biodiversity; nature habitats; protection level; conservation planning; Marxan model;BIODIVERSITY; AREAS; MANAGEMENT","Changing monsoon patterns, snow and glacial melt, its impacts and adaptation options in northern India: Synthesis This paper gives a synthesis of this special issue on the sensitivity to climate change of the main bio-physical processes in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayas.

Traditional agricultural practices, extensive use of inputs, and abrupt changes in climate have been of great concern to agriculture production around the world, especially in developing countries. Therefore, it is very vital to adopt and expand Climate-Smart agricultural (CSA) practices. By the cross-sectional data of 350 cotton farmers from major cotton-growing districts of Punjab Pakistan, adoption of CSA practices such as irrigation and soil and crop management practices is evaluated, and factors which affect farmer adoption decision and its impact on poverty, income, and yield are estimated by using logistic regression and propensity score matching (PSM) respectively. The results found that education, access to credit, tubewell ownership, farming experience, and access to extension services positively influenced farmers' adoption behavior. Further, PSM results revealed that adoption of CSA practices is economical, financially, environmentally desirable, and pro-poor. According to these findings, ultimately adoption would help in reducing the negative impact of climate change on the cotton crop by ensuring profits, removing the barriers in the adoption, disseminating the information about CSA, and strictly enforcing the regulations for CSA.

The role of the IPCC ""is to assess on a comprehensive, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation."" This paper discusses the working of the IPCC and at least five ways in which the IPCC can be viewed as an amazingly successful transformative initiative. The IPCC is a model for the futures community, for it is helping not only to transform our conceptions of time and our concerns about the future, but also the conduct, organization, and use of science around the world. ","Summable C factors for contemporary soil use Crop cultivation, crop stages and the seasonal distribution of rainfall erosivity are continuously changing in response to changes in climate and socio-economic conditions. Therefore, the crop and cover factor (C factor) of the (Revised) Universal Soil Loss Equation should also be adjusted continuously. Within the framework of the (R) USLE, C factors can only be calculated for crop rotations. However, for large-scale and regional modeling of soil erosion on arable land and targeted subsidy schemes for the implementation of soil protection measures, C factors are required that quantify the effect of individual crops and management options on the risk of soil erosion. We therefore develop a method for deriving summable C factors that can easily be combined to derive C factors for crop rotations. These summable C factors also account for carry-over effects that influence the risk of soil erosion in subsequent crops. Using the latest data on the temporal distribution of rain erosivity and approximately 3.5 million observations of crop stages, summable C factors were derived for 57 crops and crop management options, including double cropping, which is currently becoming more prevalent in temperate areas. These C factors apply for Germany. However, the regional variation of summable C factors within Germany was small and comparison with Swiss data indicated that our summable C factors will also apply in neighboring countries in Central Europe. Changes in the seasonal distribution of rain erosivity and in crop development due to climate change caused some convergence of the summable C factors for different crops, i.e. the C factors for crops where the risk of soil erosion potential had previously been low increased, while for those crops where the risk of erosion had previously been high the C factors decreased. Of the arable crops, potatoes had by far the highest summable C factor, whereas sod-forming crops had negative summable C factors, leading to low C factors for crop rotations. The sod crops seem to be largely responsible for the low level of soil erosion found on many organic farms and in Switzerland, where sod crops account for a large share of arable land.

Its share in the final energy consumption varies depending on the country and the adopted energy policy. The article presents the structure of electricity production from renewable energy sources in Poland in the years 2002-2019. It was found that the share of energy production from hydroelectric power plants in Poland in relation to the amount of energy produced from renewable energy sources in the analyzed years has strongly decreased. The reason for this state was an increase in the production of energy coming from wind and biomass energy combined with an increase in subsidies for these energy producers. Additionally, unstable hydrological conditions, mainly low river flows, may be the reason for the low share of energy produced in power plants. As a case study, data for five small hydropower plants (SHP) located on the Gwda river (north-western Poland) were analyzed. Electricity production volumes were analyzed depending on the size of the Gwda river flow. It was found that the lower amount of electricity produced at SHPs on the Gwda river is mainly due to lower flows in the river. In the future, unstable electricity production from renewable energy sources may have a significant impact on achieving Poland's energy targets in 2030. renewable energy sources (RES); hydroelectricity; small hydropower plant (SHP); Poland;POWER SECTOR; MULTIMODEL ASSESSMENT; HYDROLOGICAL REGIME; WATER-RESOURCES; CHANGE IMPACTS; ENERGY; RIVER; ADAPTATION; EUROPE; GENERATION","Forests' First Decade: A Bibliometric Analysis Overview Forests is a Swiss open access journal in the field of forestry and forest ecology founded in 2010.

These colonial-era legacies are problematic, because they fail to recognize the unique diversity of Asian savannahs and the critical roles of fire and herb ivory in maintaining ecosystem health and diversity. In this review, we show that: the palaeo-historical evidence suggests that the savannahs of Asia have existed for at least 1 million years, long before widespread landscape modification by humans; savannah regions across Asia have levels of C-4 grass endemism and diversity that are consistent with area-based expectations for non-Asian savannahs; there are at least three distinct Asian savannah communities, namely deciduous broadleaf savannahs, deciduous fine-leafed and spiny savannahs and evergreen pine savannahs, with distinct functional ecologies consistent with fire- and herbivory-driven community assembly. Via an analysis of savannah climate domains on other continents, we map the potential extent of savannahs across Asia. We find that the climates of African savannahs provide the closest analogues for those of Asian deciduous savannahs, but that Asian pine savannahs occur in climates different to any of the savannahs in the southern continents. Finally, we review major threats to the persistence of savannahs in Asia, including the mismanagement of fire and herbivory, alien woody encroachment, afforestation policies and future climate uncertainty associated with the changing Asian monsoon. Research agendas that target these issues are urgently needed to manage and conserve these ecosystems.

Locating itself in the earlier MRV literature, the article examines the Paris transparency framework comprehensively, while deepening analysis of key aspects: differentiation, common modalities, procedures, and guidelines (MPG), adaptation, support, and technical expert review. The article illustrates the shifts from MRV to the Paris Agreement enhanced transparency framework. The transparency framework is characterized neither as common' nor differentiated', but includes common MPG, underpinned by built-in flexibility and continuous capacity building. Informational requirements on action are common, whereas those in relation to support are differentiated. The Paris Agreement established mandatory requirements to report regularly GHG inventories and information to track progress on implementing and achieving nationally determined contributions. Information on both mitigation and support is subject to technical expert review, which operationally may combine the work of expert review teams and technical teams of experts. The article considers implications for further work at the domestic and international levels.Policy relevanceThe enhanced transparency framework on action and support is central to the Paris Agreement, adding mandatory components of review.The transition from MRV to transparency should bear in mind existing arrangements.Expert review teams and technical teams of experts could be combined.The scope of transparency includes adaptation, and methodological work needed.Domestic institutional arrangements remain key, requiring continuous support for capacity.

In this article, I investigate how public perceptions of climate change risk are affected by communications from political parties and the degree of polarization among them. Specifically, using survey data from Sweden, Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, I study the relationship between party source cues, perceived polarization, and public perceptions of climate change risk. The results reveal a positive relationship between party cues and perceptions of climate change risk, indicating that individuals adjust their risk perceptions to align with their party preference. Furthermore, a negative relationship between perceived polarization and individual risk perceptions is also discovered, showing that individuals tend to be less concerned with climate change the more polarization they perceive. However, the effect of perceived polarization is found to be limited to more abstract perceptions of risk, while being unrelated to perceptions of concrete risks. Even with some contextual variance, the results generally hold up well across the four countries.

However, the effect of LID practices has seldom been evaluated in detail. In this study, the effect of individual and combined LID practices on the reduction of roof runoff are specifically quantified considering the hydrological relationship between LID at the building scale and the campus scale at Beijing Normal University (BNU). The results show that individual and combined LID practices effectively reduce roof runoff for all types of rainfall and for rainfall with return periods from 0.5 to 50 years at the building scale. Combination scenarios maintain good performance with fewer areas of composed LID. Most values for the effect of combination scenarios are between the effects of composed LID. To achieve the highest cost efficiency, low elevation greenbelts should be the first choice, and green roofs should only be selected when low elevation greenbelts and rain barrels cannot be implemented. At the campus scale, individual and combined LID practices effectively reduce the outflow from and the overflow in the campus and combination scenarios have the best reduction performance. This study provides an important reference for urban water management and LID related decision making.

The findings show that livestock production contributes to reducing poverty and livestock assets are influenced by the number of shocks that households faced during the last three years, access to credits, farmland size, education of household head, irrigation system, and access to the national electricity. We suggest that empowering rural households to better cope with shocks contributes to developing livestock and consequently to reducing rural poverty. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOODS; CONSUMPTION; HOUSEHOLDS; REDUCTION; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; ACCUMULATION; INSURANCE; COUNTRIES","Two lobster tales: lessons from the convergent evolution of TURFs in Maine (USA) and the Juan Fernandez Islands (Chile) Overexploitation plagues common property marine resources in a seemingly endless replay of the tragedy of the commons. Territorial use rights in fisheries (TURFs) counter this by controlling access and reducing incentives to compete for larger shares of the resource. Two lobster TURF systems evolved convergently in Maine, USA, and Juan Fernandez Islands, Chile. The Homarus aniericanus H. Milne-Edwards, 1837 lobster fishery in Maine has informal group territories, whereas the Jasus frontalis (H. Milne-Edwards, 1837) fishery in the Juan Fernandez Islands has individually-owned fishing spots called marcas. Both fisheries use small day boats, both have a long history of protecting reproductive and juvenile lobsters, and both evolved informal fishing territories. Although TURFs limited new entrants in both cases, fishing effort grew, prompting both fisheries to support formal limited-entry regulations. Both lobster populations have expanded in recent decades. Maine's 30-yr increase in lobster landings stimulated fishers to use larger boats with increased fishing capacity and range to exploit offshore lobsters that have been increasing in abundance, but where territorial rights do not exist. Nevertheless, trap limits have led to more equitable access. In Juan Fernandez, power winches increased trap-hauling rates, leading some fishers to advocate trap limits. The TURF system of marcas appears to have limited effort, but it has not prevented the accumulation of marcas by individuals. We conclude these TURFs have addressed the problem of exclusion and have growing lobster populations. It is unknown if TURFs can respond effectively to external factors, such as climate change, that may lead to declining populations. nan;HOMARUS-AMERICANUS; JASUS-FRONTALIS; ROCK LOBSTER; FISHERIES; CONNECTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; ARCHIPELAGO; DEMOGRAPHY; DECAPODA","Affective Images of Climate Change Climate change is not only a scientific phenomenon, but also a cultural one. Individuals' opinions on climate change are often based on emotion rather than on scientific evidence. Therefore, research into the emotional characteristics of the imagery that the non-expert public find relevant to climate change is important in order to build a database of effective climate change imagery, which can then be used by scientists, policymakers, and practitioners in mobilizing climate adaptation and resilience efforts. To this end, we collected ratings of relevance to climate change as well as emotional arousal and valence on 320 images to assess the relationship between relevance to climate change and the emotional qualities of the image. In addition, participants' environmental beliefs were measured, to investigate the relationship between beliefs and image ratings. The results suggest that images rated highly relevant to climate change are higher in negative emotional valence and emotional arousal. Overall, images were rated as being more relevant to climate change by participants with higher pro-environmental disposition. Critically, we have compiled the mean relevance, valence, and arousal ratings of each of these 320 images into a database that is posted online and freely available (https://affectiveclimateimages.weebly.com; https://www.nmu.edu/affectiveclimateimages) for use in future research on climate change visuals. climate change; global warming; image database; environmental attitudes; emotion;ENVIRONMENTAL PARADIGM SCALE; PUBLIC-OPINION; CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; AMERICAN STATES; BEHAVIOR; GREEN; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; POLICY; US","Climate change adaptation mainstreaming in the planning instruments of two South African local municipalities This article reflects on the role of urban planning in climate change adaptation and the role of planning instruments in facilitating the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation. An analytical framework is introduced to analyse primary spatial and integrated planning instruments in the City of Cape Town and Thulamela Local Municipality in South Africa, as comparative cases with core similarities and contextual differences. The findings are discussed in terms of where adaptation should be included throughout the planning process and the extent to which the cases have been able to mainstream climate change adaptation within their planning instruments. The findings show that local municipal plans and policies are recognising the impact of climate change on settlements and the role of planning in responding to these impacts. However, there is little evidence of addressing these long-term impacts through programmatic and coherent approaches using short- to medium-term planning instruments.

Conceptualizing integrated water resources management for implementing sustainable development goals While the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, establishes an ambitious set of goals, targets and indicators for supporting global sustainability, greater conceptual clarity is required to measure implementation. A key UN Target (6.5) for implementing sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 is to 'implement integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels'. However, we argue that the current UN emphasis on measuring its implementation through institutional indicators limits our understanding of effectiveness, while ignoring links to other SDGs. While IWRM is often interpreted to mean the integration of water-related management components at the river basin scale, conceptualizations differ significantly. Specifying the critical normative principles of IWRM, therefore, becomes important for measuring its implementation. Drawing upon pre-existing conceptualizations, we consequently identify seven core principles or dimensions (integration; scale; institutions; participation; economic valuation; equity; and, environmental/ecological protection) to re-conceptualize IWRM after the adoption of agenda 2030. These dimensions, we argue, allow more objective measurement of IWRM implementation through the development of Target 6.5 sub-indicators. They also help shift IWRM beyond its current 'water centric' emphasis to enhance its contribution to achieving other SDGs such as those for ending poverty, providing clean and affordable energy, achieving gender equality, protecting terrestrial ecosystems, promoting sustainable cities, combatting hunger and climate change, and strengthening the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

In spite of this attention, many aspects about the ES concept have remained controversial to date, i.e., their classification, value, generation, link to human well-being, and supportive role as management tool. This review explores the knowledge status of ecosystem services, focusing on those services generated in coastal and marine environments (CMES). A knowledge gap and an underdevelopment of tools to assess CMES is evident in the literature, especially when compared to the progress done in the assessment of land ES. Possible explanations reside on the yet small proportion that the research done on CMES represents for the ecosystem service framework (ESF), in part due to the intrinsic challenges of researching the marine environment, also due to the limited availability of spatial data on marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, the ES concept is getting more attention toward policy-makers and stakeholders, leading to the implementation of an ecosystem services approach (ESA) to the management and protection of CMES. Six lessons are rescued from the literature to improve the ESA: (1) integration of the ESA in a science-policy process; (2) more simplicity for the CMES prediction models; (3) move toward empowering of stakeholders; (4) integration of the value pluralism of CMES with less focus on money; (5) the link of ES to Human Well-being must not been forgotten; and (6) communication of results and social literacy are key. coastal and marine ecosystem services; ecosystem service approach; ecosystem services framework; human well-being; policy making;CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; DECISION-MAKING; ECONOMIC VALUATION; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; TRADE-OFFS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MANGROVE CONSERVATION; ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; POVERTY ALLEVIATION","Learning from the tropical cyclones that ravaged Zimbabwe: policy implications for effective disaster preparedness In view of increasing cyclonic activity in the Indian Ocean, nations in southern Africa should prepare well for flood-related disasters. This paper critically examined the level of preparedness of the government of Zimbabwe to cyclonic disasters using the country's three most disastrous cyclones during the past two decades: (a) Cyclone Eline of 2000, (b) Cyclone Dineo of 2017 and (c) Cyclone Idai of 2019. In-depth qualitative interviews, post-disaster lessons learned workshops and a review of disaster policies provided data on five key preparedness measures: (a) prepositioning of resources, (b) early warnings, (c) evacuation, (d) citizen participation and (e) effective response. The findings demonstrate that the government of Zimbabwe remains in the disaster-response-disaster cycle instead of a proactive preventive approach to cyclones. Limited financial and material resources constrain effective preparedness to disasters. These problems stem from a weak legislation governing disaster risk reduction. This study therefore proposes five-policy implications for effective disaster preparedness.

The development of the Copernicus Programme by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU) has contributed to the effective monitoring of the Earth's surface by producing the Sentinel-2 multispectral products. Sentinel-2 satellites are the second constellation of the ESA Sentinel missions and carry onboard multispectral scanners. The primary objective of the Sentinel-2 mission is to provide high resolution satellite data for land cover/use monitoring, climate change and disaster monitoring, as well as complementing the other satellite missions such as Landsat. Since the launch of Sentinel-2 multispectral instruments in 2015, there have been many studies on land cover/use classification which use Sentinel-2 images. However, no review studies have been dedicated to the application of ESA Sentinel-2 land cover/use monitoring. Therefore, this review focuses on two aspects: (1) assessing the contribution of ESA Sentinel-2 to land cover/use classification, and (2) exploring the performance of Sentinel-2 data in different applications (e.g., forest, urban area and natural hazard monitoring). The present review shows that Sentinel-2 has a positive impact on land cover/use monitoring, specifically in monitoring of crop, forests, urban areas, and water resources. The contemporary high adoption and application of Sentinel-2 can be attributed to the higher spatial resolution (10 m) than other medium spatial resolution images, the high temporal resolution of 5 days and the availability of the red-edge bands with multiple applications. The ability to integrate Sentinel-2 data with other remotely sensed data, as part of data analysis, improves the overall accuracy (OA) when working with Sentinel-2 images. The free access policy drives the increasing use of Sentinel-2 data, especially in developing countries where financial resources for the acquisition of remotely sensed data are limited. The literature also shows that the use of Sentinel-2 data produces high accuracies (>80%) with machine-learning classifiers such as support vector machine (SVM) and Random forest (RF). However, other classifiers such as maximum likelihood analysis are also common. Although Sentinel-2 offers many opportunities for land cover/use classification, there are challenges which include mismatching with Landsat OLI-8 data, a lack of thermal bands, and the differences in spatial resolution among the bands of Sentinel-2. Sentinel-2 data show promise and have the potential to contribute significantly towards land cover/use monitoring.

(Climate) migration as a symptom in the Anthropocene ""While the climate-migration nexus raises crucial questions of mobility and climate justice, it is commonly understood through simplistic narratives that reify a complex set of relations. The spectre of environmentally-induced exodus is recurrent in media, policy and activist circles, in spite of numerous studies that reveal the empirical flaws and noxious normative implications of such narratives. This article explores this insistence and the desire(s) for there to be a reified relation between climate and migration such insistence reveals. The article proceeds in three movements. First, it situates discourses on climate migration in relation to the crisis of humanism the Anthropocene signifies. Second, it operates a symptomatic reading of climate migration discourses, drawing on two understandings of symptom elaborated by Lacan - as 'return of the repressed' and as 'Sinthome'. Read as a symptom, the figure of the climate migrant/refugee appears as the return of fundamental contradictions that carve contemporary regimes of socioecological (re)production. Through the concept of 'Sinthome', discourses on climate migration can be read as (illusory) attempts to shore up for the waning consistence of modern forms of 'being human'. Finally, the article proposes a symptomatic reading of the Anthropocene itself, and elaborates on what the dissolution of this symptom/ Sinthome would entail.""

China's terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink is currently offsetting 7-15% of national anthropogenic emissions and has received widespread attention regarding its role in the 'carbon neutrality' strategy. We provide perspectives on this question by inferring from the fundamental principles of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycles. We first elucidate the basic ecological theory that, over the long-term succession of ecosystem without regenerative disturbances, the carbon sink of a given ecosystem will inevitably approach zero as the ecosystem reaches its equilibrium state or climax. In this sense, we argue that the currently observed global terrestrial carbon sink largely emerges from the processes of carbon uptake and release of ecosystem responding to environmental changes and, as such, the carbon sink is never an intrinsic ecosystem function. We further elaborate on the long-term effects of atmospheric CO2 changes and afforestation on China's terrestrial carbon sink: the enhancement of the terrestrial carbon sink by the CO2 fertilization effect will diminish as the growth of the atmospheric CO2 slows down, or completely stops, depending on international efforts to combat climate change, and carbon sinks induced by ecological engineering, such as afforestation, will also decline as forest ecosystems become mature and reach their late-successional stage. We conclude that terrestrial ecosystems have nonetheless an important role to play to gain time for industrial emission reduction during the implementation of the 'carbon neutrality' strategy. In addition, science-based ecological engineering measures including afforestation and forest management could be used to elongate the time of ecosystem carbon sink service. We propose that the terrestrial carbon sink pathway should be optimized, by addressing the questions of 'when' and 'where' to plan afforestation projects, in order to effectively strengthen the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink and maximize its contribution to the realization of the 'carbon neutrality' strategy.

The following variables were evaluated in half-sibling individuals from two mothers, a fast-growing (CR) and a slow-growing (CL) genotype: height and basal diameter (BD) increment, stomatal conductance (g(s)), minimum and maximum daily water potential (Psi), photosynthesis at light saturation (A(sat)), branch specific hydraulic conductivity (k(s)), hydraulic conductance (K-h), leaf specific hydraulic conductivity (k(l)) and aerial biomass allocation. The CR genotypes had higher height and BD increment and increased biomass production. Daily g(s) and Psi patterns and A(sat) were similar among genotypes. In contrast, CR genotypes presented a higher water conduction efficiency per leaf area unit under conditions of high soil water availability, although their k(s) was more affected under water deficit conditions than in CL genotypes. The observed differences in biomass allocation within aerial compartments, leading to changes in the whole hydraulic architecture of the plant, would be responsible for differential growth rates. In addition, the observed trend of a lower stomatal regulation in CR, reflected in a higher degree of anisohydrism and higher k(s) losses in a dry period, suggests that these genotypes could be more vulnerable to water deficits than CL, requiring further studies to test this hypothesis. intraspecific variation; aboveground biomass allocation; increment; plant hydraulic architecture; vapor pressure deficit;WATER AVAILABILITY; GAS-EXCHANGE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PRODUCTIVITY; ARCHITECTURE; PHENOLOGY; GENOTYPES; YOUNG; L.","Assessing the effects of drought and ""Grain for Green"" Program on vegetation dynamics in China's Loess Plateau from 2000 to 2014 China's Loess Plateau (CLP) has experienced severe water loss and soil erosion over the past few decades. To prevent water loss and soil erosion and improve ecological environment, the Grain for Green Project (GGP) was launched in 1999. Meanwhile, the frequency and severity of drought in CLP has shown an increasing trend in the recent years. However, few studies have addressed the coupled effects of drought and the GGP on vegetation dynamics in this area. Based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this study assesses the change trends of drought and vegetation dynamics and the role of droughts and GGP on trends in vegetation dynamics. Results show that: (1) At the regional scale, annual and seasonal NDVI show a significant increase from 2000 to 2014; however, drought change trends were insignificant. (2) At the pixel scale, annual, spring, summer, and autumn NDVI increased in the CLP from 2000 to 2014, with 51.92%, 50.04%, 74%, and 62.69% of the study area showing a significant increase, respectively, with p < 0.05. Summer drought had strongest effect on vegetation dynamics. (3) Drought was one of the primary reasons for the decreasing trend of NDVI in the northern of the CLP. The severe and extreme drought (SPEI < -1.5) in summer of 2001 and 2005 reduced the NDVI by 22.44% and 9.98%, respectively. (4) The residual analysis results indicate that 21.54% of the CLP was affected by drought. 43.64% and 34.82% of the CLP experienced human induced improvement and degradation, respectively. (5) The GGP had an important influence on vegetation dynamics, strong correlations between the cumulative afforestation area and annual NDVI in Yan'an and Yulin from 2000 to 2013 were found, with r = 0.96 and 0.65. The spatial pattern of the cumulative afforestation area ratio matched quite well with the NDVI change trend.

This effect is predicted to be exacerbated in the future, under a climate change scenario. One way to mitigate this effect is to use the urban green infrastructure as a way to promote the cooling island effect. In this study we aimed to model, with a high spatial resolution, how Mediterranean urban parks can be maximized to be used as cooling islands, by answering the following questions: i) which factors influence the cooling effect and when?; ii) what type of green spaces contributes the most to the cooling effect?; iii) what is the cooling distance of influence? To answer these questions we established a sampling design where temperature and relative humidity were measured in different seasons, in locations with contrasting characteristics of green and grey cover. We were able to model the effect of green and grey spaces in the cooling island effect and build high spatial resolution predicting maps for temperature and relative humidity. Our study showed that even green spaces with reduced areas can regulate microclimate, alleviating temperature by 1-3 degrees C and increasing moisture by 2-8%, on average. Green spaces with a higher density of trees were more efficient in delivering the cooling effect. The morphology, aspect and level of exposure of grey surfaces to the solar radiation were also important features included in the models. Green spaces influenced temperature and relative humidity up to 60 m away from the parks' limits, whereas grey areas influenced in a much lesser range, from 5 m up to 10 m. These models can now be used by citizens and stakeholders for green spaces management and human well-being impact assessment.<bold> </bold> Artificial areas; Urban green infrastructure; Land-cover; Nature-based solutions; Urban heat island; Urban microclimate;URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE; THERMAL COMFORT; AIR-TEMPERATURE; LAND-COVER; TREES; MITIGATION; IMPACT; CITY; LANDSCAPE","EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE EXPOSURE AND THE AMPHIBIAN CHYTRID FUNGUS ON GRAY TREEFROG (HYLA CHRYSOSCELIS) METAMORPHOSIS Pesticides are detectable in most aquatic habitats and have the potential to alter host-pathogen interactions. The amphibian chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), has been associated with amphibian declines around the world. However, Bd-associated declines are more prominent in some areas, despite nearly global distribution of Bd, suggesting other factors contribute to disease outbreaks. In a laboratory study, the authors examined the effects of 6 different isolates of Bd in the presence or absence of a pesticide (the insecticide carbaryl or the fungicide copper sulfate) to recently hatched Cope's gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis) tadpoles reared through metamorphosis. The authors found the presence or absence of pesticides differentially altered the mass at metamorphosis of tadpoles exposed to different Bd isolates, suggesting that isolate could influence metamorphosis but not in ways expected based on origin of the isolate. Pesticide exposure had the strongest impact on metamorphosis of all treatment combinations. Whereas copper sulfate exposure reduced the length of the larval period, carbaryl exposure had apparent positive effects by increasing mass at metamorphosis and lengthening larval period, which adds to evidence that carbaryl can stimulate development in counterintuitive ways. The present study provides limited support to the hypothesis that pesticides can alter the response of tadpoles to isolates of Bd and that the insecticide carbaryl can alter developmental decisions.

","Tree species selection revisited for plantations in the Interior Cedar Hemlock zone of southern British Columbia We provide results from two trials comparing performance of species of known provenance planted on logged sites in the southern Interior Cedar Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone of southern British Columbia 20 and 26 years after establishment. The commonly used plantation species, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), interior spruce (a naturally occurring hybrid between Picea glauca and P. engelmannii) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), survived as well as, but grew more slowly than, western larch (Larix occidentalis), western white pine (Pinus monticola) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and faster than western redcedar (Thuja plicata). Site index values were generally higher than published values for similar sites. Numerous pests affected all species in the trials. Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) caused heavy mortality in lodgepole pine in part of one trial, and Armillaria root disease caused widespread damage to western larch and Douglas-fir in the other trial. Western white pine from local seed sources were severely damaged by white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) in both trials but a rust-resistant seed source used in one trial survived better. Frost damage reduced survival and growth of Douglas-fir in one trial and may have affected western white pine. Survival of two planted broadleaves (Betula papyrifera) and a hybrid of black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) and black poplar (Populus nigra) was severely reduced by drought. The results support ongoing efforts to broaden the number of species used in British Columbia reforestation programs. plantations; species selection; survival; growth and yield; pest damage;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LODGEPOLE PINE; ROOT DISEASE; TOP HEIGHT; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; FORESTS; FACE","Complex adaptive systems engineering and risk reduction Complex adaptive systems are central to many persistent problems locally and globally. In cases where the effects of a policy play out slowly and propagate through interdependencies with other systems, the broader view and understanding gained from complex adaptive system analyses allow us to recognise the causal relationships involved and solve persistent system-level issues. This is particularly true with the risks due to climate change, economic crises, energy disruptions and food insecurity. Climate change and the challenge of addressing the resulting global risks provides a common set of problems on which to build a global community of practice that utilises earth systems' engineering approaches and sustainability goals to understand and resolve problems in complex adaptive systems of systems. Structural adaptation under environmental stress, simple rules for entity interactions and condition-dependent behaviours are key attributes of complex systems. These attributes provide the means for creating models that behave the way the real system does and for the same reasons, improving understanding and designing effective solutions. This paper presents general concepts for infrastructure adaptation and examples of successful applications of an expanded engineering process for complex systems of systems. dynamics; infrastructure planning; sustainability;nan","Carbon stocks and sequestration in plantation forests in the Republic of Ireland The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol (KP) have created a clear need for methods that enable accurate accounting of carbon (C) stocks and stock changes in forest ecosystems. The rate of accumulation of C in plantation forests in the Republic of Ireland was estimated for the period 1906-2002 using the record of afforestation and a dynamic C accounting model (C-flow). Projections for the period 2003-2012 were made using different afforestation rates. It was assumed that Sitka spruce planted in the period 1906-1989 was Yield Class (YC) 16 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and that after 1990 this increased to 20 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1). All other conifers were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 8 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) lodgepole pine. Broadleaves were assumed to have the growth characteristics of YC 6 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) beech. In 2002, the total forest C stock was 37.7 Mt C representing an increase of 14.8 Mt C since 1990. In 2002, the rate of increase in trees, products, litter and soil was 0.7, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.5 Mt C, respectively. Under a business-as-usual scenario, afforestation since 1990 is estimated to create an annual average C sink of 0.9 Mt C year(-1) during the period 2008-2012. This accounts for similar to 22 per cent of Ireland's reduction commitment under the KP. Afforestation on peat soils was found to reduce the net C sink, although the extent to which it does so is highly dependent on assumptions regarding the rate of peat C loss. nan;PRODUCTS; PEATLANDS; BRITAIN; BALANCE; FLUXES; SOILS","Site-specific water-use strategies of mountain pine and larch to cope with recent climate change We aim to achieve a mechanistic understanding of the eco-physiological processes in Larix decidua and Pinus mugo var. uncinata growing on north- and south-facing aspects in the Swiss National Park in order to distinguish the short- and long-term effects of a changing climate. To strengthen the interpretation of the delta O-18 signal in tree rings and its coherence with the main factors and processes driving evaporative-delta O-18 needle water enrichment, we analyzed the delta O-18 in needle, xylem and soil water over the growing season in 2013 and applied the mechanistic Craig-Gordon model (1965) for the short-term responses. We found that delta O-18 needle water strongly reflected the variability of relative humidity mainly for larch, while only delta O-18 in pine xylem water showed a strong link to delta O-18 in precipitation. Larger differences in offsets between modeled and measured delta O-18 needle water for both species from the south-facing aspects were detected, which could be explained by the high transpiration rates. Different soil water and needle water responses for the two species indicate different water-use strategies, further modulated by the site conditions. To reveal the long-term physiological response of the studied trees to recent and past climate changes, we analyzed delta C-13 and delta O-18 in wood chronologies from 1900 to 2013. Summer temperatures as well as summer and annual amount of precipitations are important factors for growth of both studied species from both aspects. However, mountain pine trees reduced sensitivity to temperature changes, while precipitation changes come to play an important role for the period from 1980 to 2013. Intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi) calculated for larch trees since the 1990s reached a saturation point at elevated CO2. Divergent trends between pine WUEi and delta O-18 are most likely indicative of a decline of mountain pine trees and are also reflected in decoupling mechanisms in the isotope signals between needles and tree-rings. delta C-13 and delta O-18 in wood; delta O-18 in needle; soil and xylem water; intrinsic water-use efficiency; pine decline; tree-ring width;INDUCED TREE MORTALITY; LEAF WATER; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; OXYGEN ISOTOPES; STABLE-ISOTOPES; DROUGHT; GROWTH; CARBON; DELTA-O-18; DELTA-C-13","What's counted as a reindeer herder? Gender and the adaptive capacity of Sami reindeer herding communities in Sweden Researchers of adaptive capacity and sustainable livelihoods have frequently used social, cultural, human, economic and institutional capitals to better understand how rural and resource-dependent communities address environmental, social and economic stresses. Yet few studies have considered how men and women contribute differently to these capitals to support community resilience overall. Our research sought to understand the differential contributions of Sami men and women to the adaptive capacity of reindeer husbandry and reindeer herding communities in northern Sweden. Our focus revealed a gendered division of labour in reindeer herding as an economic enterprise as well as gendered contributions to a broader conceptualization of reindeer husbandry as a family and community-based practice, and as a livelihood and cultural tradition. Based on our results, we recommend that community resilience be enhanced by generating more opportunities for men to achieve higher levels of human and economic capital (particularly outside of herding activities) and encouraging women to contribute more directly to institutional capital by participating in the formation and implementation of legislation, policies and plans.

Exploring policy interplay across different scales of governance Policy makers have now recognised the need to integrate thinking about climate change into all areas of public policy making. However, the discussion of 'climate policy integration' has tended to focus on mitigation decisions mostly taken at international and national levels. Clearly, there is also a more locally focused adaptation dimension to climate policy integration, which has not been adequately explored by academics or policy makers. Drawing on a case study of the UK, this paper adopts both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective to explore how far different sub-elements of policies within the agriculture, nature conservation and water sectors support or undermine potential adaptive responses. The top-down approach, which assumes that policies set explicit aims and objectives that are directly translated into action on the ground, combines a content analysis of policy documents with interviews with policy makers. The bottom-up approach recognises the importance of other actors in shaping policy implementation and involves interviews with actors in organisations within the three sectors. This paper reveals that neither approach offers a complete picture of the potentially enabling or constraining effects of different policies on future adaptive planning, but together they offer new perspectives on climate policy integration. These findings inform a discussion on how to implement climate policy integration, including auditing existing policies and 'climate proofing' new ones so they support rather than hinder adaptive planning.

They disrupt everyday life by displacing individuals and families, destroying homes, and splintering communities (Gewirtz et al. in J Marital Fam Ther 34(2):177-192, 2008; La Greca and Silverman in Child Dev Perspect 3(1):4-10, 2009). School-based interventions are one approach to mitigate emotional distress in youth who have experienced a disaster, as schools are one of the most common venues for youth to receive mental health services (Greenberg et al. in Am Psychol 58:466-474, 2003). This paper explores the impact of a school-based psychosocial curriculum entitled Journey of Hope (JoH). This eight-session intervention attempts to reduce the impact of a disaster by enhancing protective factors such as social support, coping, and psycho-education. The evaluation study was conducted in the 2014-2015 school year after an EF5 tornado struck Moore, Oklahoma. As a result of the tornado, 24 people were killed, 377 injured, and two schools were destroyed (National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office, 2014). This mixed methods study employed quantitative and qualitative measures to examine the impact of the JoH intervention. Quantitative measures examined coping, general self-efficacy, prosocial behaviors, and overall distress. Qualitative data were obtained through interviews with N = 16 students after participation in the JoH. Semi-structured interview guides were used to determine what children learned, liked, and felt was beneficial from taking part in the JoH. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess the differences between the experimental and control group at baseline and posttest. Results indicated a significant increase in positive coping skills including communication and tension management and prosocial behaviors from baseline to posttest for the Journey of Hope group. No significant differences were found on self-efficacy or overall distress. Content analysis was conducted to determine qualitative results. Themes that emerged from the qualitative interviews suggested participation in the Journey of Hope enhanced peer relationships and helped participants identify how to manage emotions such as anger, anxiety, and grief. Findings from this evaluation study suggest that participation in a broadly accessible psycho-educational program may help children cope with traumatic events such as a natural disaster. Further research should be conducted to assess whether the Journey of Hope is transferrable across disaster contexts.

This study profiled occupational heat stress impacts on the health and productivity of workers in select organized and unorganized Indian work sectors. During hotter and cooler seasons, Wet Bulb Globe Temperatures (WBGT) were used to quantify the risk of heat stress, according to International workplace guidelines. Questionnaires assessed workers' perceived health and productivity impacts from heat stress. A total of 442 workers from 18 Indian workplaces participated (22% and 78% from the organized and unorganized sector, respectively). Overall 82% and 42% of workers were exposed to higher than recommended WBGT during hotter and cooler periods, respectively. Workers with heavy workloads reported more heat-related health issues (chi square = 23.67, p <= 0.001) and reduced productivity (chi square = 15.82, p <= 0.001), especially the outdoor workers. Heat-rashes, dehydration, heat-syncope and urinogenital symptoms were self-reported health issues. Cited reasons for productivity losses were: extended-work hours due to fatigue/exhaustion, sickness/hospitalization and wages lost. Reducing workplace heat stress will benefit industries and workers via improving worker health and productivity. Adaptation and mitigation measures to tackle heat stress are imperative to protect the present and future workforce as climate change progresses. occupational heat stress; health impacts; perception; prevention;CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH; PRODUCTIVITY; EXPOSURE; WORKERS; FUTURE; INJURY","A longitudinal analysis of some Australian broadacre farms' greenhouse gas emissions, farming systems and efficiency of production This study tracks the emissions of 250 rainfed broadacre farms in south-western Australia from 2002 to 2011. Relationships between their emissions, farming systems, their productive efficiency and profit efficiency are examined. Emissions varied greatly among the farms, ranging from 0.02 to 2.49 CO2-e tonnes per hectare, and averaged 0.43 CO2-e tonnes per hectare. The distribution of emissions was rightwards skewed due to a small proportion of the sample being livestock dominant farms that generated high levels of emissions per. hectare. The mix of enterprises on farms and the regional location of farms led to large differences being observed regarding farm aggregate and per hectare emissions. The trajectory of the farm emissions over the ten years was quadratic, with the diminution of emissions being attributable to the increased crop dominance of farming systems over the study period, an associated reduction in sheep numbers and the impacts of drought. The lessening in emissions towards the end of the decade occurred despite there being no policy incentive to lessen farm emissions. If these farms had to pay for their emissions then livestock farms in particular would have little capacity to pay. Across the decade, improvements in profit efficiency were significantly associated with only small increases in emissions per hectare. A 1% improvement in profit efficiency resulted in only a 0.10% increase in emissions per hectare. The implication is that improvements to the productive and profit efficiency of farms, although important for the commercial success of farming, are unlikely to cause large increases in farm emissions. Choice of the farm's enterprise mix and farm location are the more important decisions affecting farm emissions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The processes (relative sea-level rise, tidal range, and wave height) and state factors (geomorphology, coastal slope, and coastline change rate) have been analyzed to evaluate the vulnerability index of the Ivorian coastal area. This study area was divided into three zones based on geomorphology. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was computed for each zone according to six factors describing its variability. Results indicate that the entire Ivorian coastal zone falls into a moderate-risk category. The relative vulnerability of the different sections depends strongly on the geomorphology and on wave energy factors. This vulnerability increases spatially westward taking account of their CVI values. The CVI will undoubtedly increase with predicted sea-level rise. The result of this study could provide wide coastal information to coastal managers and Ivorian government coastal people and help to protect the coastal ecosystem.

In this paper, we compare Robust Decision Making with Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. We apply both to a hypothetical case inspired by a river reach in the Rhine Delta of the Netherlands, and compare them with respect to the required tooling, the resulting decision relevant insights, and the resulting plans. The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance.

The reconciliation of climatic aspects during the urban design phase is limited in implementation, due to the need for multidisciplinary collaboration between desperate scientific fields of climatology, urban planning, and urban environmental modelling. This paper aims to create an integrated interface between the microclimate, outdoor thermal comfort, and design guidelines. The investigation combines subjective and objective approaches, including on-site field measurements, a structured questionnaire using the seven-point American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE 55) thermal sensation votes, and a correlation study of these votes and the microclimatic parameters. Pedestrian thermal comfort was then examined under six shading scenarios, addressing the form and opening of shading devices using computational fluid dynamics. Modelling is based on four dependent variables: wind velocity, ventilation flow rate, air temperature, and the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index. Findings indicate that the form and location of apertures of the shading devices were the dominant factors in achieving thermal comfort on the urban scale, and led to a reduction in air temperature and a physiological equivalent temperature of 2.3-2.4 degrees C. Subjective votes indicate that people who live in hot arid climates have a wider range of adaptation and tolerance to local climatic conditions Accordingly, a psychometric chart, for the case study outdoor thermal comfort was developed. outdoor thermal comfort; physiological equivalent temperature (PET); thermal sensation votes (TSV); computational fluid dynamics (CFD);CANYON GEOMETRY; CFD SIMULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEAT-ISLAND; WIND; IMPACT; ENERGY; HOT; TEMPERATURE; VENTILATION","Assessing opportunities for scaling out, up and deep of win-win solutions for a sustainable world Win-win solutions (WWSs) that reconcile climate with economic goals offer a new suite of opportunities to build the necessary economic conditions for achieving a good life for all and reaching the Sustainable Development Goals. However, a systematic assessment of such solutions is still missing. Addressing this gap, a Global Dialogue on win-win solutions was implemented within the GREEN-WIN project to (1) co-develop a vision about 'which kind of economy do we want for which kind of world?', (2) identify exemplary WWSs in diverse domains of action and (3) evaluate the possibilities to scale win-win solutions and thus contribute to changing current core economic practices. Our assessment focuses on the potential of 'scaling out, up and deep' of solutions to attain a vision of a sustainable world. We find that critical factors for scaling such experiences across the globe are initiating and facilitating opportunities for sharing information and knowledge, boosting multi-stakeholder collaboration and co-creating and building transformative capacities, while ensuring financial support for niche experimentation. nan;NICHE MANAGEMENT; INNOVATIONS; TRANSITIONS","PHENOLOGY OF 'MENDEZ' AVOCADO IN SOUTHERN JALISCO, MEXICO In the southern area of the state of Jalisco, Mexico, cultivation of 'Mendex' avocado (Persea americana Miller) is important due to its adaptation to the semi-warm climate of the region and because of its early maturation and harvest (summer), in relation to 'Hass' (fall), although the lack of knowledge of its phenology makes the effective management of 'Mindez' orchards difficult. The objective of this study was to document the phenology of 'Mendez' during two production cycles (2014-15 and 2015-16), in two commercial orchards with supplementary irrigation from October to June (annual rain of 728 mm), established in soils of volcanic origin and light texture in southern Jalisco. The maximum temperatures of the soil at 30 cm from the surface were in May (24.5 degrees C) and the minimum from January to March (15.9 to 14.5 degrees C). The vegetative flushes (VF) were found in summer (August-September) and winter (February), as well as flowering in summer (September) and winter (February). Flower development (vegetative bud to anthesis) in shoots from the summer and winter VFs lasted 187 and 222 d, respectively. The fruit drop (5 to 6 cm of diameter) was similar in the two flowering seasons (55.4 to 61.8 %). The fruit maturity (>= 22.7 % d.m.) happened in July and in September-October for fruits from the summer and winter flowering periods, respectively. There were two flushes of root production and the greatest was in summer (June to August). The maximum and minimum average environmental temperatures of the warmest (April to June) and coldest (January to March) months were 31 and 9 degrees C, respectively. The results from this study are basic to compare the future changes in the phenology of 'Mendez' avocado. vegetative flushes; flower development; roots; ecophysiology;HASS AVOCADO; GROWTH; INFLORESCENCE; COMMITMENT; FLOWER","Evolutionary Climate-Change Modelling: A Multi-Agent Climate-Economic Model In climate-economic modelling, agent-based models are still an exception. Although numerous authors have discussed the usefulness of the approach, only a few models exist. The paper proposes an update to a multi-agent climate-economic model, namely the ""battle of perspectives"" (Janssen, 1996; Janssen and de Vries 1998). The approach of the paper is twofold. First, the reimplementation of the model follows the ""model to model"" concept. Supporters of the approach argue that replication is a useful way to check a model's accuracy and robustness. Second, updating a model with current data and new scientific evidence is a robustness check in itself. The long-term validity and usefulness of a model depends on the variability of the data on which it is based, as well as on the model's sensitivity to data changes. By offering this update, the paper contributes to the development of agent-based models in climate-economics. Acknowledging evolutionary processes in climate-policy represents a useful complement to intertemporal cost-benefit analyses, the latter of which derive optimal protection paths but are not able to explain why people do not follow them. Since the replication and update succeeded, the paper recommends using the model as a basis for further analysis. ","Siberia and neighboring regions in the Last Glacial Maximum: did people occupy northern Eurasia at that time? An updated analysis of Paleolithic sites in Siberia and the Urals C-14-dated to the coldest phase of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), with its timespan currently determined as ca. 23,000-19,000 BP (ca. 27,300-22,900 cal BP), is presented. It is demonstrated that people continuously occupied the southern and central parts of Siberia and the Russian Far East (up to 58A degrees N latitude), and perhaps sporadically settled regions located even further north, up to 70A degrees N, throughout the LGM. This is in accord with our previous data, but is now based on a larger dataset, and also on a paleoecological analysis of the major pre-LGM archaeological sites in Siberia and the Urals north of 58A degrees N. It is clear that Paleolithic people in northern Eurasia were able to cope with the treeless tundra environment well in advance of the LGM, at least at ca. 34,000-26,000 BP (ca. 38,500-30,000 cal BP). Therefore, a high degree of adaptation to cold conditions allowed people to survive in Siberia during the LGM.

It is seen that the recent El Nino has been accompanied by higher fluctuation in glacier coverage on Nevado Champara and the loss of glacier coverage on Cerro Tilata was very high during the past 16 years. Rise in snowline altitude of selected glaciers was very high after the 2015/16 El Nino. Increase in the area covered by snow and ice during the La Nina periods were not enough to cover the ice loss occurred during the previous El Nino events and the strongest El Nino in 2015/16 was followed by a significant loss of ice-covered areas in the tropical Andes. Freshwater resources in this region will be affected in the near future if the current trends in glacier decline continue. Adaptation strategies needs to be implemented to reduce the impacts of the continuing loss of glacierized on regional communities in the tropical Andean region.

However, the use of fossil methanol is insufficient to meet climate change targets, while renewable methanol is yet unavailable on a commercial scale. This paper presents a novel biorefinery concept based on biomass solvolysis to produce crude lignin oil (CLO) from forest residues, a drop-in biofuel for methanol-propelled ships, and evaluates its environmental and economic profiles. In the base scenario, CLO can achieve emission saving of 84% GHG compared to fossil alternatives, and a minimum selling price (MSP) of $821 per ton of methanol equivalent (ME), i.e., within the range of the current bio-methanol production costs. The emission of GHGs of co-produced ethanol can be reduced by 67% compared to fossil analogues. The increase of renewable electricity share to 75% is capable of shrinking emissions by 1/5 vs. the base case, while fossil methanol losses, e.g., of that in cellulose pulp, can boost emissions by 63%. Low-pressure steam use in the biomass pretreatment, as well as biorefinery capacity increase by a factor of 2.5, have the greatest potential to reduce MSP of CLO to $530 and $614 per ton of ME, respectively. lignin oil; drop-in marine biofuel; life cycle assessment; techno-economic analysis; multi-product biorefinery;nan","Spatial Relationship between Natural Wetlands Changes and Associated Influencing Factors in Mainland China Many studies have explored the dynamic change of wetlands distribution which play an important role in wetlands conservation and its sustainable management. However, given an uneven distribution of natural wetland resources in the context of global change, little is known about the spatial relationship between natural wetlands changes and associated influencing factors in mainland China. In this study, Moran-based spatial statistics are an effective methodology to examine the spatial patterns of natural wetlands and associated influencing factors at the province level, and GIS mapping is applied to help visualize spatial patterns. Results show that 1) significant spatial agglomeration and regional differences of natural wetlands distribution have been captured by Moran's I statistics, and the agglomeration level has increased over the past ten years; 2) Seven of the eight factors show significantly strong and positive spatial autocorrelation except for water consumption, and spatial patterns of them show significant spatial clusters or spatial outliers; 3) Spatial coordination between natural wetlands distribution and the associated influencing factors is higher in the western region than in east China and northeast China. Moreover, spatial coordination between a cultivated area or water consumption and natural wetlands distribution is weaker than that of other factors. Finally, the influences generated by neighboring provinces should not be neglected in the implementation of wetlands conservation. This study could provide a scientific basis for the policy making of wetlands conservation and sustainable management systems. spatial autocorrelation; spatial pattern; spatial relationship; natural wetlands changes; associated influencing factors; mainland China;GLOBAL CLIMATE-CHANGE; SANJIANG PLAIN; DRIVING FORCES; RIVER DELTA; DEGRADATION; PLATEAU; QINGHAI; BIODIVERSITY; ISSUES; SOILS","Extreme weather events induced deaths in India 2001-2014: Trends and differentials by region, sex and age group This study examined the trend in extreme weather event related mortality reported in India during 2001-14 and explored the regional, age and sex differentials in such fatalities. We used age and sex-segregated data on the number of accidental deaths by unnatural causes released by Government of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy. Various extreme weather events were grouped into five broad categories: cold wave, extreme precipitation, heat wave, lightning, and tropical cyclone. During 2001-14, 25% of all accidental deaths due to unnatural causes happened as a result of extreme weather events. Deaths due to extreme precipitation and tropical cyclones declined over time, whereas increasing trend was observed for lightning, and extreme temperature conditions. Most of the extreme weather event induced deaths were due to lightning, followed by extreme precipitation and temperature extremes. The burden of death was highest in the central part of India. States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal were affected the most by extreme weather events. More males and older population died than their counterparts. Findings suggest that people are adaptive to some extreme weather events such as cold wave and cyclones; whereas adaptation and coping with the heat wave and extreme precipitation seems to be less. Building awareness on the adaptive mechanisms to different extremes and a community-centered alert system can help in reducing fatalities due to extreme weather events.

Research results indicated that: (a) Sediment load changes are severely impacted by the different types of human activity (e.g. construction of water reservoirs, deforestation/afforestation); and the runoff variability is the direct result of climatic changes, e.g. the precipitation changes. (b) The impacts of human activity and climatic changes on the sediment load and runoff changes are greater in smaller river basins (e.g. the Jialingjiang River basin) than in larger river basins. The response of sediment load and runoff changes to the impacts of human activities and climatic changes are prompt and prominent in the Jialingjiang River basin relative to those in the mainstem of the Yangtze River basin. (c) Construction of the Three Gorges Dam has already had obvious impacts on the sediment transport process in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, but shows no obvious influence on the runoff changes. Construction of the Three Gorges Dam will result in further re-adjustment of the scouring/filling process within the river channel in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, and have corresponding effects on the altered sediment load because of the Dam's operation for the river channel, ecology, Sustainable social economy and even the development of the Yangtze Delta. This will be of concern to local governments and policy makers. sediment load; runoff changes; wavelet approach; Yangtze River basin;TEMPORAL VARIATION; WAVELET; PRECIPITATION; STREAMFLOW; TRENDS; CHINA; ENSO","The role of social capital for farmers' climate change adaptation in Lancang River basin in China This paper distinguishes between bridging and bonding social capital to assess their roles for individual farmers' adaptation strategies taken through technology adoption. Based on primary data collected in Langcang River (LCR) basin area in southwestern China, the paper finds: (1) adaptation measures have been widely taken by surveyed households, but non-infrastructure-based measures are more prevalent than infrastructure-based measures and (2) surveyed households have strong social capital while having weak bridging social capital. Their bonding social capital has significantly positive relationship with their adaptation decisions, but bridging social capital does not have such statistically significant relationship. It recommends that the governments contemplate carefully how to help the poor to get a good combination of bonding and bridging social capital when designing policies to help the rural poor to improve their long-term adaptive capacity and achieve sustainable rural development.

How we choose to respond provides important insights into our ability to collectively act in the face of threats with the unique characteristics of climate change. This communication attempts to provide an overview of some of the difficulties in forging new policy directions along our coastlines in an era of climate change. It is meant as a referential framing for the research presented in this Special Issue. As this communication is being written, the world is gripped by a global pandemic caused by a variant of the coronavirus. There are important corollaries between the underlying characteristics of the coronavirus and the causes and effects of climate change. Seeing how the global citizenry is responding to the current epidemic provides some insight into the difficulties in fostering collective action towards climate change. As with the pandemic, the issue is not really one of understanding the problem, but rather the varying human responses to the problem. We can expect the same difficulties as we continue to confront the ever-growing problem of climate change. climate change; coastal adaptation; collective action;nan","An appraisal of Indonesia's immense peat carbon stock using national peatland maps: uncertainties and potential losses from conversion Background: A large proportion of the world's tropical peatlands occur in Indonesia where rapid conversion and associated losses of carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services have brought peatland management to the forefront of Indonesia's climate mitigation efforts. We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks. Results: Peatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia's total peat carbon store to be within 13.6 GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5 GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8 GtC) and MoA (25.3 GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75 GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia's peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62-71% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are < 300 cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia's total peat carbon and about 12 years of global emissions from land use change at current rates. Conclusions: Considering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia's peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.

"4","Australian rainfall variability-Why is the eastern seaboard of Australia different to the rest of Australia and also internally inhomogeneous The Eastern Seaboard of Australia (ESA) has been identified as being different to the rest of Australia in terms of rainfall patterns. However, rainfall patterns within the ESA itself are not well understood. This study identifies Australian rainfall districts that exhibit similar (and different) temporal variation, with the primary aim being to determine if the ESA can be considered a homogenous region with respect to rainfall. The results (a) confirm that the ESA is different to the rest of Australia and (b) show that the ESA is not homogenous and that East Coast Lows (ECLs) are linked to this inhomogeneity. For winter (JJA) three separate divisions within the ESA are identified and at least two clear divisions are identified in other seasons. ECL sub-types contribute to this inhomogeneity because each ECL sub-type is associated with different spatio-temporal rainfall patterns across the ESA. This is an important insight for natural resources management and emergency services within the heavily populated ESA because it demonstrates that existing climate related risks are different across the ESA. Further, the way climate risks change in the future is also likely to be inconsistent across the ESA. Future climate related risks will depend on how ECL behaviour (e.g., intensity, frequency, location, duration, path and geographical extent) changes. This reinforces the need for locally relevant and practically useful climate science information and adaptation strategies-as opposed to the State- or country-wide information and adaptation approaches that are commonly used. climate risk; climate variability; East Coast low; ECL; extreme rainfall; water security;nan","Joint effects of climate variability and socioecological factors on dengue transmission: epidemiological evidence ObjectiveTo assess the epidemiological evidence on the joint effects of climate variability and socioecological factors on dengue transmission. MethodsFollowing PRISMA guidelines, a detailed literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Peer-reviewed, freely available and full-text articles, considering both climate and socioecological factors in relation to dengue, published in English from January 1993 to October 2015 were included in this review. ResultsTwenty studies have met the inclusion criteria and assessed the impact of both climatic and socioecological factors on dengue dynamics. Among those, four studies have further investigated the relative importance of climate variability and socioecological factors on dengue transmission. A few studies also developed predictive models including both climatic and socioecological factors. ConclusionsDue to insufficient data, methodological issues and contextual variability of the studies, it is hard to draw conclusion on the joint effects of climate variability and socioecological factors on dengue transmission. Future research should take into account socioecological factors in combination with climate variables for a better understanding of the complex nature of dengue transmission as well as for improving the predictive capability of dengue forecasting models, to develop effective and reliable early warning systems.

We developed statistical models that account for the spatiotemporal ignition patterns by cause in the eastern slopes of the Cascades in Oregon, USA. Projected changes in energy release component from a suite of climate models were used with our model to quantify changes in frequency and extent of human and lightning-caused fires and record-breaking events based on sizes of individual fires between contemporary (2006 -2015) and mid-century conditions (2031-2060). No significant change was projected for the number of human-caused fire ignitions, but we projected a 14% reduction in lightning-caused ignitions under future conditions. Mean fire sizes were 31% and 22% larger under future conditions (2031-2060) for human and lightning-caused ignitions, respectively. All but one climate model projected increased frequency of record-breaking events relative to the contemporary period, with the largest future fires being about twice the size of those of the contemporary period. This work contributes to understanding the role of lightning- and human-caused fires on future fire regimes and can help inform successful adaptation strategies in this landscape. energy release component; generalized additive model; human-caused fires; lightning-caused fires;LARGE WILDLAND FIRES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INCREASE; USA","Can Herbivore Management Increase the Persistence of Indo-Pacific Coral Reefs? Due to climate change, coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, and mortality events in recent years. Although coral reefs are unlikely to persist in their current form unless climate change can be addressed, local management can have a role to play by extending the time frame over which there are functional reef systems capable of recovery. Here we consider the potential application of one form of local management - management of herbivorous fishes. The premise behind this approach is that increased herbivory could shift reef algal assemblages to states that are benign or beneficial for corals, thereby increasing corals' ability to recover from destructive events such as bleaching and to thrive in periods between events. With a focus on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, we review what is known about the underlying processes of herbivory and coral-algal competition that ultimately affect the ability of corals to grow, persist, and replenish themselves. We then critically assess evidence of effectiveness or otherwise of herbivore management within marine protected areas (MPAs) to better understand why many MPAs have not improved outcomes for corals, and more importantly to identify the circumstances in which that form of management would be most likely to be effective. Herbivore management is not a panacea, but has the potential to enhance coral reef persistence in the right circumstances. Those include that: (i) absent management, there is an ""algal problem"" - i.e., insufficient herbivory to maintain algae in states that are benign or beneficial for corals; and (ii) management actions are able to increase net herbivory. As increased corallivory is a potentially widespread negative consequence of management, we consider some of the circumstances in which that is most likely to be a problem as well as potential solutions. Because the negative effects of certain algae are greatest for coral settlement and early survivorship, it may be that maintaining sufficient herbivory is particularly important in promoting recovery from destructive events such as mass bleaching. Thus, herbivore management can have a role to play as part of a wider strategy to manage and reduce the threats that currently imperil coral reefs. coral resilience; climate change; herbivory; parrotfish; marine protected areas; coral reef; algae; Indo-Pacific;MARINE PROTECTED AREAS; RESILIENCE-BASED MANAGEMENT; BENTHIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHASE-SHIFTS; ALGAL TURFS; BLEACHING RECOVERY; SPECIES RICHNESS; MACROALGAE; COMPETITION","Estimation of losses and damages caused by flash floods in the commercial area of Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia Flash flood is the most devastating natural disaster experienced in Malaysia. It can be defined as any high water flow caused by various factors such as rainstorms, slow water run-off, and broken dams. In Malaysia, the most typical and disruptive hydro-meteorological occurrences are flash floods, which are mostly faced by Malaysian cities including Kuala Lumpur and Kajang. However, flash floods may occur at any time of the year rather than during monsoon and can result in devastating losses and damages. Thus, several mitigation steps and estimations are warranted to handle flash floods, especially at the city level. Hence, this paper estimated the amount of direct loss and damage due to flash floods on the basis of the commercial area of Kajang City. This empirical study used primary data collected through direct face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 41 businessmen in the study area. The average estimated overall losses and damages per shop were RM4,510.07 due to flash floods at Kajang City in 2014, wherein the significant contribution comes from the economic side. This study's findings can serve as the baseline information for future studies on flash flood losses and damages. Furthermore, the present study suggests extensive institutional research for estimating losses and damages due to flash floods at the country level as an adaptation strategy.

The research objective of this study was to construct a Water Poverty Index (WPI) for islands. The empirical scope of this study was based on Kinmen Island in the Taiwan Strait, which has very scarce water resources. Kinmen has a dry climate with low rainfall and high evaporation. Therefore, the Kinmen area is long-term dependent on groundwater resources and faces serious water resource problems. This study used the WPI to examine various issues related to water resources. In addition, this study selected several main indicators and performed time series calculations to examine the future trends of water resources in Kinmen. The results show that the overall water resources of Kinmen are scarce. To ensure sustainable development of water resources in Kinmen, policies to improve water scarcity, such as water resource development, water storage improvement, and groundwater control, should be researched. The research results of this study can be used as a reference for government agencies in formulating and revising water resources to achieve the sustainable development of island-type water resources.

Nuclear proteins (NPs) and phosphoproteins (NPPs) execute crucial cellular functions that form the regulatory hub for coordinated stress response. Phosphoproteins hold enormous influence over cellular signalling. Four-week-old seedlings of a grain legume, chickpea, were subjected to gradual dehydration, and NPs were extracted from unstressed control and from 72- and 144-hr stressed tissues. We identified 4,832 NPs and 478 phosphosites, corresponding to 299 unique NPPs involved in multivariate cellular processes including protein modification and gene expression regulation, among others. The identified proteins included several novel kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors, besides 660 uncharacterized proteins. Spliceosome complex and splicing related proteins were dominant among differentially regulated NPPs, indicating their dehydration modulated regulation. Phospho-motif analysis revealed stress-induced enrichment of proline-directed serine phosphorylation. Association mapping of NPPs revealed predominance of differential phosphorylation of spliceosome and splicing associated proteins. Also, regulatory proteins of key processes viz., protein degradation, regulation of flowering time, and circadian clock were observed to undergo dehydration-induced dephosphorylation. The characterization of novel regulatory proteins would provide new insights into stress adaptation and enable directed genetic manipulations for developing climate-resilient crops. alternative splicing; cellular signalling; dehydration; legume; nuclear phosphoproteome; nuclear proteome; stress tolerance;POSTTRANSLATIONAL REGULATION; PHOSPHOPROTEOMICS REVEALS; PROTEINS; TRANSLATION; MEMBRANE; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; STAGE; LIGHT","The influence of internal load density on the energy and thermal performance of air-conditioned office buildings in the face of global warming Internal heat sources may not only consume energy directly through their operation (e.g. lighting), but also contribute to building cooling or heating loads, which indirectly change building cooling and heating energy. Through the use of a building simulation technique, this paper investigates the influence of building internal load densities on the energy and thermal performance of air-conditioned office buildings in Australia. Case studies for air-conditioned office buildings in major Australian capital cities are presented. It is found that with a decrease of internal load density in lighting and/or plug load, both the building cooling load and total energy use can be significantly reduced. Their effect on overheating hour reduction would be dependent on the local climate. In particular, it is found that if the building total internal load density is reduced from the base case of ""medium"" to ""extra low"", the building total energy use under the future 2070 high scenario can be reduced by up to 89-120 kWh/m(2) per annum, and the overheating problem could be completely avoided. It is suggested that the reduction in building internal load densities could be adopted as one of the adaptation strategies for buildings in the face of the future global warming. building performance; global warming; building simulation; adaptation strategies; internal load density;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIGHTING RETROFITS; DEMAND; IMPACT; TERM","Monitoring, reporting and verification for national REDD plus programmes: two proposals Different options have been suggested by Parties to the UNFCCC (United Framework Convention on Climate Change) for inclusion in national approaches to REDD and REDD+ (reduced deforestation, reduced degradation, enhancement of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forest, and conservation of forest carbon stocks). This paper proposes that from the practical and technical points of view of designing action for REDD and REDD+ at local and sub-national level, as well as from the point of view of the necessary MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification), these should be grouped into three categories: conservation, which is rewarded on the basis of no changes in forest stock, reduced deforestation, in which lowered rates of forest area loss are rewarded, and positive impacts on carbon stock changes in forests remaining forest, which includes reduced degradation, sustainable management of forest of various kinds, and forest enhancement. Thus we have moved degradation, which conventionally is grouped with deforestation, into the forest management group reported as areas remaining forest land, with which it has, in reality, and particularly as regards MRV, much more in common. Secondly, in the context of the fact that REDD/REDD+ is to take the form of a national or near-national approach, we argue that while systematic national monitoring is important, it may not be necessary for REDD/REDD+ activities, or for national MRV, to be started at equal levels of intensity all over the country. Rather, areas where interventions seem easiest to start may be targeted, and here data measurements may be more rigorous (Tier 3), for example based on stakeholder self-monitoring with independent verification, while in other, untreated areas, a lower level of monitoring may be pursued, at least in the first instance. Treated areas may be targeted for any of the three groups of activities (conservation, reduced deforestation, and positive impact on carbon stock increases in forest remaining forest).

Direct clinical practice considerations, however, have not been adequately fostered equitably across all regions with an often-confusing array of practice areas within planetary health and sustainable healthcare. This article calls for a more coordinated effort within clinical practice spaces given the urgency of global environmental change, while also taking lessons from Indigenous traditional knowledge systems-a viewpoint that is rarely heard from or prioritized in public health or medicine. Simpler and more coordinated messaging in efforts to improve patient and planetary health are needed. The creation of unifying terminology within planetary health-rooted clinical and public health practice has been proposed with the potential to bring forth dialogue between and within disciplinary offshoots and public health advocacy efforts, and within clinical and health-system policy spaces. planetary health; co-benefits; health professionals; climate change; sustainable healthcare; prescribing practices; Indigenous knowledges;INDIGENOUS MEDICINE; SUSTAINABILITY; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; CARE","Three-step modification and optimization of Kalina power-cooling cogeneration based on energy, pinch, and economics analyses This study proposes a systematic approach for modification and optimization of Kalina power-cooling cogeneration (KPCC) under a three-step procedure. In the first of three steps, KPCC is modeled and optimized thermodynamically by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). In the second step, heat pinch analysis (HEPA) modifies the performance of KPCC heat exchangers network (HEN). Finally, the geometries of the heat exchangers are optimized by nonlinear programming (NLP) to minimize the system's purchasing cost. The results showed that KPCC could achieve thermal and power-cooling efficiencies of 12.1% and 38.6%, respectively. Moreover, the HEN satisfied HEPA constraints with nine exchangers at a minimum temperature difference (DT) of 10 K. By employing NLP, investment costs of the heat exchangers were reduced significantly and the overall investment costs of KPCC decreased by approximately 31%, demonstrating that the three-step procedure can optimize KPCC efficiency while minimizing costs.

Here, using the case study of community resilience during Hurricane Michael in 2018, the authors show that an overemphasis on recovery entrench 'resilience traps'. Building community resilience in the face of climate disasters is critical to achieving a sustainable future. Operational approaches to resilience favor systems' agile return to the status quo following a disruption. Here, we show that an overemphasis on recovery without accounting for transformation entrenches 'resilience traps'-risk factors within a community that are predictive of recovery, but inhibit transformation. By quantifying resilience including both recovery and transformation, we identify risk factors which catalyze or inhibit transformation in a case study of community resilience in Florida during Hurricane Michael in 2018. We find that risk factors such as housing tenure, income inequality, and internet access have the capability to trigger transformation. Additionally, we find that 55% of key predictors of recovery are potential resilience traps, including factors related to poverty, ethnicity and mobility. Finally, we discuss maladaptation which could occur as a result of disaster policies which emphasize resilience traps. nan;SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATURAL DISASTERS; TRAJECTORIES; RESTORATION; PERSPECTIVE; ADAPTATION; WEATHER; METRICS","Is industrialization still a viable development strategy for developing countries under climate change? The implications of climate change for economic development strategies in developing countries are explored, in particular whether industrialization still represents a viable development strategy in the context of climate change. Synthesizing the relevant literature and drawing insights from a comparison of Chinese and Indian experiences, it is argued that industrialization still represents an effective and, to some extent, indispensable development strategy, especially for those low- and low-middle-income countries that are affected by deindustrialization. climate change; deindustrialization; developing countries; development strategies; economic development; industrialization;GROWTH; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; POVERTY","Temporal and Spatial Changes and GLOF Susceptibility Assessment of Glacial Lakes in Nepal from 2000 to 2020 Glacial lakes are a sensitive indicator of regional climate change and one of the initiators of glacier disasters. It is of great significance to understand the spatial distribution and change characteristics of glacial lakes for exploring their response patterns to climate change and assessing the glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) susceptibility. Based on Gaofen-1/6 PMS, Sentinel-2A/2B MSI and Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images from 2000 to 2020, we integrated geographic information technology and mathematical and statistical methods to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of glacial lakes in Nepal and their dynamic changes, and further discriminated and evaluated the GLOF susceptibility of glacial lakes. The results show that there were 2420 glacial lakes in Nepal in 2020, mainly distributed within the 4500 similar to 5500 m, with an area of 87.21 km(2) and a water storage of 1921.72 x 10(6) m(3). The number and area of glacial lakes with each area above 0.01 km(2) in Nepal showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, while 499 new glacial lakes were born, 139 lakes disappeared, the area and water storage increased by 19.46 km(2), 403.07 x 10(6) m(3), respectively. Glacial lakes at altitudes <3000 m were relatively stable, while the number and area of glacial lakes at altitudes within 4500-5500 m increased rapidly. We assessed the GLOF susceptibility of 40 moraine-dammed glacial lakes with an area above 0.2 km(2) in Nepal, and found that there were 8, 12, 14 and 6 glacial lakes with low, medium, high and very high susceptibility, respectively. Among glacial lakes with very high GLOF susceptibility, potential GLOF events of Tsho Rolpa glacial lake, Lower Barun glacial lake and glacial lake with code of GL87091E27797N will cause great harm to downstream regions. GLOFs in Nepal will be in an active status in the future, therefore, the dynamics of glacial lakes and their surroundings should be continuously monitored. glacial lake; outburst probability; remote sensing; Gaofen image; Nepal;MOUNT EVEREST REGION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; OUTBURST FLOODS; INVENTORY; BASIN; CLASSIFICATION; DRAINAGE; HIMALAYA; IMPACTS; MODEL","The association between diurnal temperature range and emergency room admissions for cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive and genitourinary disease among the elderly: A time series study Objectives: To evaluate the short-term effect of diurnal temperature range (DTR) on emergency room (ER) admissions among elderly adults in Beijing. Methods: After controlling the long-time and seasonal trend, weather, air pollution and other confounding factors, a semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the exposure-effect relationship between DTR and daily ER admissions among elderly adults with different lag structures from 2009 to 2011 in Beijing. We examined the effects of DTR for stratified groups by age and gender, and conducted the modifying effect of season on DTR to test the possible interaction. Results: Significant associations were found between DTR and four major causes of daily ER admissions among elderly adults in Beijing. A 1 degrees C increase in the 8-day moving average of DTR (lag 07) corresponded to an increase of 2.08% (95% CI: 0.88%-3.29%) in respiratory ER admissions and 2.14% (95% CI: 0.71%-3.59%) in digestive ER admissions. A 1 degrees C increase in the 3-day and 6-day moving average of DTR (lag 02 and lag 05) corresponded to a 0.76% (95% CI: 0.07%-1.46%) increase in cardiovascular ER admissions, and 1.81% (95% CI: 0.21%-3.45%) increase in genitourinary ER admissions, respectively. The people aged 75 years and older were associated more strongly with DTR than the 65-74 age group. The modifying effect of season on DTR was observed and it was various in four causes. Conclusions: This study strengthens the evidence that DTR is an independent risk factor for ER admissions among elderly persons. Some prevention programs that target the elderly and other high risk subgroups for impending large temperature changes may reduce the impact of DTR on people's health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The entire C&DW management under the responsibility of the municipal government was considered. The potential environmental impacts were assessed by using two specific life cycle impact assessment methodologies, CML baseline (v3.03) and Impact 2002+ (v2.12). The results obtained by both methodologies highlighted the importance of the avoided impacts from recovered materials, mainly those related to steel, glass and plastics recycling. In particular, the CML baseline indicated ""Human Toxicity"" as the most important category, mainly due to the avoided impacts from steel recycling and the generated impacts from transportation in all the C&DW management stages. The Impact 2002+ highlighted instead the role of the categories of ""Respiratory Inorganics"" and ""Global Warming"", in accordance with the results related again to steel recycling and transportation but also to landfilling of solid residues. The study considered some alternative scenarios of the mineral fraction management, which quantified the expected advantages of increasing C&DW recycling and improving the quality of recycled aggregates.

The Obama Administration attracted significant attention in June 2014 when it proposed widely varying greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets for each state's electricity sector. This article examines the bases for these varying targets, concluding that they may present a new model of cooperative federalism, in two senses. Under cooperative federalism's traditional structure, the federal government is the standard-setting body and states are the implementers of those standards. Under the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Power Plan, however, the federal government uses state policies to provide the content for the federal standards, essentially ""federalizing'' state environmental policies. The Plan also pegs state emissions targets to a state's capacity to reduce emissions, as opposed to a state's contribution to greenhouse gas concentrations. EPA's approach unquestionably enhances states as laboratories of democracy and addresses collective active problems. It also facilitates the economic and political feasibility of climate-change mitigation efforts. Nevertheless, for states and environmental policymaking going forward, it may also present issues of fairness and perverse incentives. nan;STANDARDS","Christmas Tourists' Perceptions to Climate Change in Rovaniemi, Finland Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland is the self-proclaimed official home of Santa Claus.' However, in recent years, after several warm and snowless season starts, Christmas tourism businesses have expressed concern about the future of the region's winter tourism industry. This paper examines the challenges of winter tourism operators to adapt to changing environmental conditions by surveying the responses of tourists to potential changes in winter conditions. In the light of climate change projections, maintaining the attractive image of a snow-covered winter wonderland may become impossible. Results indicate that tourists react negatively to estimated changes and planned adaptation mechanisms. This situation may force tourism entrepreneurs and destination managers to reconsider the consequences of current adaptation strategies and develop new attractions and marketing strategies in order to attract new markets and/or rebrand the destination.

Negative SPI values represents drought, while positive values indicate wet periods. The results suggest that negative SPI periods coincide with El Nino years: 82-83, 91-92 and 97-98. The 91-92 event had the largest impact on the region. These results indicate that the most severe droughts in the basin of Dagua, were presented at the quarters of Dec-Jan-Feb, Jan-Feb-Mar, Jun-Jul-Aug and Jul-Aug-Sep. The results have been obtained with geostatistical techniques, and are a basic input to formulate adaptation strategies and ensure food sovereignty of small farmers against drought. nan;Climate variability; Drought; El Niño; Standardized precipitation index; climate variation; drought; El Nino; meteorology; precipitation assessment; rainfall; Colombia","Intelligent Urban Planning and Ecological Urbanscape-Solutions for Sustainable Urban Development. Case Study of Wolfsburg Intelligent urban planning and ecological urbanism can be recognized as two of the key solutions to act against urban sprawl. This process is associated with suburbanization, blurring boundaries between the city and suburbs, and the undefined role of open and green spaces within new structures. It has been identified as the biggest and the most common problem worldwide. This non-central planning has a huge impact not only on economic aspects, but-most of all-on the ecological and landscaping balance within the urban area. This study covers not only the recognition of the outlined situation, but also a conceptual proposal to challenge the problems of urban sprawl. The city of Wolfsburg serves as a case study to which the tools of Ecological Urbanism and Intelligent Urbanism were applied. A corrective plan for the study area has been worked out, based on the main approaches in urban planning of the 21st century. The green transformation processes to achieve resiliency within urban areas are inevitable and will have to be conducted due to the rising number of the dwellers, steadily changing climate, and socio-economic conditions all over the world. The main solutions include mainly the system of green corridors, interconnectedness of open spaces, walkability with smart mobile options and social community as a nucleus of a local neighborhood. ecological urbanism; ecological urbanscape; green infrastructure; urban sprawl; Intelligent Urbanism; urban design;SMART CITIES; CITY","Global Food Security Assessment during 1961-2019 Quantified components of the global food system are used to assess long-term global food security under a series of socio-economic, epidemic normalization and climate change scenarios. Here, we evaluate the global food security including the global farming system as well as the global food trade, reserve and loss systems from 1961 to 2019, and analyze their temporal and spatial characteristics by using the global food vulnerability (GFV) model. The spatio-temporal patterns of the vulnerability of the global food system were consistent with the GFSI. As food production and consumption vary greatly in different countries which have continued for a long time, food exports from many developed agricultural countries have compensated for food shortages in most countries (about 120 net grain-importing countries). As a result, many countries have relied heavily on food imports to maintain their domestic food supplies, ultimately causing the global food trade stability to have an increasing impact on the food security of most countries. The impact of global food trade on global food security increased from 9% to 17% during 1961-2019, which has increased the vulnerability of the global food system. The food damage in the United States, Russia, China, and India has varied significantly, and global cereal stocks have fluctuated even more since 2000. From 1961 to 2019, the food system security of some Nordic countries significantly improved, while the food system security of most African countries significantly deteriorated. Most countries with high food insecurity are located in Africa and South Asia. In order to cope with extreme events, these countries need to strengthen and improve their own food production and storage systems, which will help the World Food and Agriculture Organization to formulate relevant food policies and maintain sustainable development.

We set out to project future temperature-related myocardial infarction (MI) events in Augsburg, Germany, at increases in warming of 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C. Methods: Using daily time series of MI cases and temperature projections under two climate scenarios, we projected changes in temperature-related MIs at different increases in warming, assuming no changes in population structure or level of adaptation. Results: In a low-emission scenario that limits warming to below 2 degrees C throughout the 21st century, temperature-related MI cases will decrease slightly by -6 (confidence interval -60; 50) per decade at 1.5 degrees C of warming. In a high-emission scenario going beyond the Paris Agreement goals, temperature-related MI cases will increase by 18 (-64; 117) and 63 (-83; 257) per decade with warming of 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C, respectively. Conclusion: The future burden of temperature-related MI events in Augsburg at 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C of warming will be greater than at 1.5 degrees C. Fulfilling the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees C is therefore essential to avoid additional MI events due to climate change. nan;HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMI-REGISTRY; MONICA/KORA; DEATHS","Temperature and precipitation, but not geographic distance, explain genetic relatedness among populations in the perennial grass Festuca rubra Aims Knowledge of genetic structure of natural populations and its determinants may provide key insights into the ability of species to adapt to novel environments. In many genetic studies, the effects of climate could not be disentangled from the effects of geographic proximity. We aimed to understand the effects of temperature and moisture on genetic diversity of populations and separate these effects from the effects of geographic distance. We also wanted to explore the patterns of distribution of genetic diversity in the system and assess the degree of clonality within the populations. We also checked for possible genome size variation in the system. Methods We studied genetic variation within and among 12 populations of the dominant grass Festuca rubra distributed across a unique regional-scale climatic grid in western Norway, Europe and explored the importance of temperature, precipitation and geographic distance for the observed patterns. We also explored the distribution of genetic diversity within and among populations, identified population differentiation and estimated degree of clonality. The analyses used microsatellites as the genetic marker. The analyses were supplemented by flow cytometry of all the material. Important Findings All the material corresponds to hexaploid cytotype, indicating that ploidy variation does not play any role in the system. The results indicate that temperature and precipitation were better predictors of genetic relatedness of the populations than geographic distance, suggesting that temperature and precipitation may be important determinants of population differentiation. In addition, precipitation, alone and in interaction with temperature, strongly affected population genotypic diversity suggesting increased clonality towards the coldest and especially the coldest wettest climates. At the same time, individuals from the coldest and wettest climates also had the highest individual genetic diversity, suggesting that only the most heterozygous individuals survive under these harsh climates. Most of the genetic variation was distributed within populations, suggesting that most populations have sufficient genetic diversity to adapt to novel climatic conditions. The alpine populations, i.e. populations which are likely the most endangered by climate change, however, lack this potential due to the high levels of clonality as detected in our study.

This article explores and develops roadmaps towards mitigating these emissions in developing economies. Nonetheless, mitigating the impacts of global warming on humanity entails curtailing the greenhouse emissions which is very challenging given that this Greenhouse Gas (GHG) is emitted during agricultural food production processes. The Kaya and Index Decomposition Analysis (Kaya-IDA) models are used to decompose and study the drivers of the agricultural Greenhouse Gas emission (methane and nitrous oxide) in Nigeria from 1990 to 2019. Moreover, different policies are developed using scenario-based analysis from 2020 to 2050 to show possible Greenhouse Gas emission mitigation pathways. The results show that the agricultural greenhouse emission intensity and per capita output are the leading drivers of the total agricultural level of emission in Nigeria. There is also a decline in agricultural value-added contribution in the past decade to the overall emission level. Among the four policy scenarios, the Special Package Policy, which achieves a more than a proportional reduction in agricultural greenhouse emission intensity relative to other driving factors, results in a favourable and substantially reduced level of overall emission in the agricultural sector of Nigeria. The implications of this study also apply to other African economies with similar agricultural sectors like that of Nigeria. nan;Agriculture; GHG Emission; Index decomposition; Nigeria; Scenario analysis; Simulation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Agricultural greenhouse; Developing economies; Emissions intensity; Greenhouse emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Index decomposition; Nigeria; Nitrous oxide; Scenarios analysis; Simulation; Agriculture","Climate change vulnerability in Ethiopia: disaggregation of Tigray Region Climate change and variability severely affect rural livelihoods and agricultural productivity, yet they are causes of stress vulnerable rural households have to cope with. This paper investigated farming communities' vulnerability to climate change and climate variability across 34 agricultural-based districts in Tigray, northern Ethiopia. It considered 24 biophysical and socio-economic indicators to reflect the three components of climate change vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. A framework was used that combines exposure and sensitivity to produce potential impact, which was then compared with adaptive capacity in order to yield an overall measure of vulnerability. The classic statistical technique of factor analysis was applied to generate weights for the different indicators and an overall vulnerability index was constructed for the 34 rural districts. The analysis revealed that the districts deemed to be most vulnerable to climate change and variability overlapped with the most vulnerable populations. The most exposed farming communities showed a relatively low capacity for adaptation. The study further showed that vulnerability to climate change and variability is basically linked to social and economic developments. vulnerability; climate change; adaptive capacity; exposure; sensitivity;COASTAL COMMUNITIES; CHANGE ADAPTATION; FOOD SECURITY; POVERTY; LEVEL; VARIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; DROUGHT; INDEXES","Registration of plant genetic resources in India - A review Plant genetic resources (PGR) are building block for genetic improvement to develop climate-resilient varieties in agri-horticultural crops. Use of genetic resources depends upon the availability of information and material in public domain to ensure the accessibility of the germplasm to the breeders. While access is of paramount significance, equally important is the recognition of the breeders/researchers who had developed/identified the trait-specific germplasm and establish the ownership of the same in view of Intellectual Property Rights. Indian Council of Agricultural Research has established a mechanism to register the trait-specific germplasm through National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources to address the above concerns. During last 15 years, about 1 030 accessions of various 186 agri-horticultural crops have been registered so far for particular trait(s). This paper reviews the status trait-specific germplasm registered for major cereals, millets, oilseeds, legumes and vegetable crops by breeders/researchers during last 15 years. While giving brief account on history of PGR registration and trend of registration of germplasm, in-depth analyses were attempted to disseminate the information about trait-specific germplasm available in public domain for use in crop improvement programmes. The information on most-sought-after traits by breeders in various crops were also collected, collated and presented which may be useful to identify and register the new potentially valuable trait-specific germplasm to use the same to develop new climate-resilient crop varieties in future.

However, the anticipated changes to coastal dunes have not yet been demonstrated using field data. Here, we provide evidence of dune translation that is characterized by a linear increase of the dune toe elevation on the order of 13-15 mm/year during recent decades along the Dutch coast. This rate of increase is a remarkable 7-8 times greater than the measured sea level rise. The observed vertical dune toe translation coincides with seaward movement of the dune toe (i.e., progradation), which shows similarities to prograding coasts in the Holocene both along the Dutch coast and elsewhere. Thus, we suspect that other locations besides the Dutch coast might also show such large ratios between sea level rise and dune toe elevation increase. This phenomenon might significantly influence the expected impact of sea level rise and climate change adaptation measures. nan;SHORELINE RESPONSE; BRUUN RULE; BEACH; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; EROSION; MODEL","The Safe Yield and Climatic Variability: Implications for Groundwater Management Methods for calculating the safe yield are evaluated in this paper using a high-quality and long historical data set of groundwater recharge, discharge, extraction, and precipitation in a karst aquifer. Consideration is given to the role that climatic variability has on the determination of a climatically representative period with which to evaluate the safe yield. The methods employed to estimate the safe yield are consistent with its definition as a long-term average extraction rate that avoids adverse impacts on groundwater. The safe yield is a useful baseline for groundwater planning; yet, it is herein shown that it is not an operational rule that works well under all climatic conditions. This paper shows that due to the nature of dynamic groundwater processes it may be most appropriate to use an adaptive groundwater management strategy that links groundwater extraction rates to groundwater discharge rates, thus achieving a safe yield that represents an estimated long-term sustainable yield. An example of the calculation of the safe yield of the Edwards Aquifer (Texas) demonstrates that it is about one-half of the average annual recharge. nan;HIGH-PLAINS; AQUIFER","Head-body length variation in the mole-shrew (Anourosorex squamipes) in relation to annual temperature and elevation Temperature change may affect physiology, distribution, morphology and adaptation of animals.

Our results indicate that head-body length of both males and females decreases with decreasing ambient temperature along an altitudinal gradient. Likewise, there is significant monthly variation in head-body length, with individuals in warmer months being larger than that colder ones. The seasonal variation in head-body length suggests the higher predator risk and lower food availability in cold months.

Foliar gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured after 60 and 80 days of treatment. Photosynthesis showed a substantial down-regulation (up to 57%) in response to elevated [CO2] and the magnitude of the down-regulation generally decreased exponentially with increasing leaf N concentration. When measured at the growth [Co-2], elevated [CO2] increased the overall rate of photosynthesis (P-n) and instantaneous water-use efficiency (IWUE) by up to 69 and 236%, respectively, but decreased transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs) in all N treatments. However, the degree of stimulation of photosynthesis by elevated [CO2] decreased as photosynthetic down-regulation increased from 60 days to 80 days of treatment. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased total photosynthetic electron transport in all N treatments at 60 days of treatment, but the effect was insignificant after 80 days of treatment. Both Ion and IWUE generally increased with increasing leaf N concentration except at very high leaf N concentrations, where both P-n and IWUE declined. The relationships of P-n and IWUE with leaf N concentration were modeled with both a linear regression and a second-order polynomial function. Elevated [CO2] significantly and substantially increased the slope of the linear regression for IWUE, but had no significant effect on the slope for P. The optimal leaf N concentration for P and IWUE derived from the polynomial function did not differ between the CO2 treatments when leaf N was expressed on a leaf area basis. However, the mass-based optimal leaf N concentration for P was much lower in seedlings in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2] (31.88 versus 37.00 mg g(-1)). Elevated [CO2] generally decreased mass-based leaf N concentration but had no significant effect on area-based leaf N concentration; however, maximum N concentration per unit leaf area was greater in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2] (1.913 versus 1.547 g N m(-2)). boreal trees; climate change; CO2-nitrogen interaction;RUBISCO ACTIVATION STATE; DOUGLAS-FIR SEEDLINGS; NUTRIENT STATUS; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; BOREAL FOREST; SCOTS PINE; NUTRITION; CAPACITY; GROWTH","Extreme Precipitation Indices Trend Assessment over the Upper Oueme River Valley-(Benin) This study analyzed trends in extreme precipitation based on daily rainfall data provided by Benin Meteo Agency for the Upper Oueme valley in Benin over the period 1951-2014. Eleven indices divided into two groups were considered. The first group consists of frequency indices: number of heavy rainfall days, very heavy rainfall days and extremely heavy rainfall days; and maximum number of Consecutive dry days and wet days. The second group concerns intensity: daily maximum rainfall (RX1day), maximum five-day rainfall (RX5day), annual total wet-day rainfall (PRCPTOT), simple daily intensity index (SDII), very wet day (R95P) and extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to assess trends in those indices. The results show that only 30% of the stations experienced decreasing trends for the number of heavy rainfall days (R10mm) and daily maximum rainfall (RX1day). For the annual total wet-day rainfall (PRCPTOT), the simple daily intensity index (SDII) and the very wet day rainfall (R95P), 20% of stations faced significant negative trends. In addition, the decreasing trends are observed for 10% stations considering the number of very heavy rainfall days (R20mm), the maximum five-day rainfall (RX5day) and the extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). About the increasing trend, 10% stations are identified for the number of consecutive dry days (CDD), very heavy rainfall days (R20mm), the daily maximum rainfall (RX1day), the simple daily intensity index, and the extremely wet day rainfall (R99P). These results show the absence of clear trend of climate indices evolution in almost all stations. Consequently, uncertainties in the evolution of rainfall indices must be taken into account in the definition of adaptation strategies for flood or drought risks. Similarly, these results show a slight drop in the dry sequences of the 1970s and 1980s revealed in the region by previous studies. rainfall; rainfall indices; frequency; intensity; upper Oueme river valley; Benin;nan","New Strategy for Innovative RD&D in View of Stakeholder Interaction during Climate Technology Transfer To tackle the global climate change issues, many countries have been interested in technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) during climate technology development and transfer processes in terms of technology innovation. According to our previous staged innovation model, technology RD&D is regarded as a crucial stage enabling the transition from technology-push to market-pull innovation. However, the strategic operation of RD&D during the climate technology transfer processes is still inactive. Thus, in the present work, we first elucidated innovative features by reviewing the RD&D activities during the climate technology transfer processes in terms of three elements of innovation: technology, market, and regulation. Moreover, innovative barriers to participating in the RD&D projects were identified by analyzing brief survey for various stakeholders from academia, private sectors, and governments. Based on both findings from case study and survey, new strategies were proposed for innovative RD&D facilitation, considering the interactions between the technology transfer matchmaker and Triple Helix during transferring climate technology. climate change; RD&D; technology innovation; Triple Helix;nan","The Demand for Index-Based Flood Insurance in a High-Income Country Increased flooding is expected to be one of the greatest threats caused by climate change. Flood insurance helps to cope with the risk of flooding, but take-up rates are relatively low in many places. Mainly in developing countries, index-based flood insurance - where the insurer's payout is based on pre-agreed weather indices instead of actual loss - has been marketed recently. In this paper, we investigate whether the introduction of index-based flood insurance with relatively low premiums is likely to attract new customers in a high-income country, namely Germany. We use data from a discrete choice experiment combined with damage data for a major flood in 2013. We find index-based flood insurance to attract similar customers as traditional damage-based, while the latter is preferred on average. Our results suggest that not many new customers would enter the market, once index-based flood insurance were available. ","Determinants of adaptation strategies to climate change among the smallholder farmers in Adama District, Ethiopia Purpose The Ethiopian economy is mainly based on the rain-fed agriculture practiced by smallholder farmers. The sector is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. This study aims to examine the determinants of adaptation strategies to climate change among the smallholder farmers in Adama District, Ethiopia. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect quantitative data using questionnaire with 351 randomly selected smallholder farmers. To collect qualitative data focus group discussions, key informant interviews and field observations were also used. Triangulated with thematic analysis, descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression model were used for the analysis. Findings The result indicated that the majority of the smallholder farmers use at least one climate change adaptation strategy in their local areas though the strategy is generally weak. In this regard, some of the dominant climate change adaptation activities identified in the study area are using improved crop varieties, planting trees, watershed management, adjusting planting date and terracing. The result from binary logistic regression model showed that age and sex of household head, as well as their education, family size, access to agricultural extension services and training on climate change significantly influence the practices of adaptation measures. Originality/value This study would help the practitioners to modify the existing weak adaptation activities by introducing advanced and technological-based adaptation strategies to the rural farming communities.

However, many proposals for protected areas expansion focus on our understanding of current spatial patterns, which may be ineffective surrogates for future needs. A science-driven call to address the biodiversity and climate crises by conserving at least 30% of lands and waters by 2030, 30 x 30, presents new opportunities to inform the siting of new protections globally and in the US. Here we identify climate refugia and corridors based on a weighted combination of currently available models; compare them to current biodiversity hotspots and carbon-rich areas to understand how 30 x 30 protections siting may be biased by data omission; and compare identified refugia and corridors to the protected areas database to assess current levels of protection. Available data indicate that 20.5% and 27.5% of identified climate adaptation areas (refugia and/or corridor) coincides with current imperiled species hotspots and carbon-rich areas, respectively. With only 12.5% of climate refugia and corridors protected, a continued focus on current spatial patterns in species and carbon richness will not inherently conserve places critical for climate adaptation. However, there is ample opportunity for establishing future-minded protections: 52% of the contiguous US falls into the top quartile of values for at least one class of climate refugia. Nearly 27% is already part of the protected areas network but managed for multiple uses that may limit their ability to contribute to the goals of 30 x 30. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of nationally identified refugia coincide with ecoregion-specific refugia suggesting representation of nearly all ecoregions in national efforts focused on conserving climate refugia. Based on these results, we recommend that land planners and managers make more explicit policy priorities and strategic decisions for future-minded protections and climate adaptation. climate refugia; climate corridors; protected areas; biodiversity conservation; carbon mitigation;REFUGIA; EXTINCTION; VELOCITY; FUTURE; AREAS","Salinity Stress in Potato: Understanding Physiological, Biochemical and Molecular Responses Among abiotic stresses, salinity is a major global threat to agriculture, causing severe damage to crop production and productivity. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is regarded as a future food crop by FAO to ensure food security, which is severely affected by salinity. The growth of the potato plant is inhibited under salt stress due to osmotic stress-induced ion toxicity. Salinity-mediated osmotic stress leads to physiological changes in the plant, including nutrient imbalance, impairment in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS), membrane damage, and reduced photosynthetic activities. Several physiological and biochemical phenomena, such as the maintenance of plant water status, transpiration, respiration, water use efficiency, hormonal balance, leaf area, germination, and antioxidants production are adversely affected. The ROS under salinity stress leads to the increased plasma membrane permeability and extravasations of substances, which causes water imbalance and plasmolysis. However, potato plants cope with salinity mediated oxidative stress conditions by enhancing both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities. The osmoprotectants, such as proline, polyols (sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, lactitol, and maltitol), and quaternary ammonium compound (glycine betaine) are synthesized to overcome the adverse effect of salinity. The salinity response and tolerance include complex and multifaceted mechanisms that are controlled by multiple proteins and their interactions. This review aims to redraw the attention of researchers to explore the current physiological, biochemical and molecular responses and subsequently develop potential mitigation strategies against salt stress in potatoes. salt tolerance; salinity; potato; abiotic stress; osmotic; genetic engineering;SOLANUM-TUBEROSUM L.; CONFERS SALT TOLERANCE; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; PLANT-GROWTH; ABIOTIC STRESS; ABSCISIC-ACID; FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOIL-SALINITY; ROT DISEASE","A framework for examining adaptation readiness Adaptation readiness is proposed as a complimentary concept to adaptive capacity that captures the strength and existence of governance structures and policy processes which determine whether adaptation takes place. As such, adaptation readiness is concerned with examining actual experiences with planning for adaptation and seeks to characterize whether human systems are prepared and ready to 'do adaptation.' We propose a framework for evaluating readiness, identifying 6 overarching factors essential for adaptation taking place: political leadership, institutional organization, adaptation decision making and stakeholder engagement, availability of usable science, funding for adaptation, and public support for adaptation. For each readiness factor we identify potential indicators, data sources, and considerations for analysis, outlining approaches for quantitative scoring and qualitative examination. We briefly illustrate application of the framework using an example from the territory of Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic, a region projected to experience some of the most dramatic changes in climate globally this century. The framework provides a systematic approach for assessing adaptation readiness, and can be used - in combination with other approaches - to inform the identification and prioritization of adaptation support, guide resources to areas where need is greatest, and serve as a proxy for adaptation tracking.

The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of conservation practices on hydraulic properties and root-zone water dynamics of the soil. A 3-year experiment was performed on a slope at Xianning. Four treatments were evaluated for their ability to reduce soil erosion and improve soil water conditions. Compared with no practices (CK) and living grass strips (GS), the application of polyacrylamide (PAM) significantly reduced soil crust formation during intense rainfall, whereas rice straw mulching (SM) completely abolished soil crust formation. The SM and PAM treatments improved soil water-stable aggregates, with a redistribution of micro-aggregates into macro-aggregates. PAM and SM significantly increased the soil water-holding capacity. These practices mitigated the degradation of the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) during intense rainfalls. These methods increased soil water storage but with limited effects during heavy rainfalls in the wet period. In contrast, during the dry period, SM had the highest soil water storage, followed by PAM and CK. Grass strips had the lowest soil water storage because of the water uptake during the vigorous grass growth. A slight decline in the soil moisture resulted in a significant decrease in the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Ku) of the topsoil. Therefore, the hydraulic conductivity in the field is governed by soil moisture, and the remaining soil moisture is more important than improving soil properties to resist short-term droughts. As a result, SM is the most effective management practice when compared with PAM and GS, although they all protect the soil hydraulic properties during wet periods. These results suggest that mulching is the best strategy for water management in erosion-threatened and drought-threatened red soils. Copyright ","Developing Macrolevel Collision Prediction Models to Evaluate Bicycle Safety in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada To encourage greener cities while reducing the impacts of the transportation system-such as impacts on climate change, traffic congestion, and road safety-governments have been investing in sustainable modes of Transportation, such as cycling. A sale and comfortable cycling environment is critical to encourage bicycle trips because cyclists are usually subject to greater safety risks. Engineering approaches to road safely management have traditionally addressed road safety by reacting to existing collision records. For bicycle collisions, which are rare events, a proactive approach is more appropriate. This study described the use of bicycle-related macrolevel (i.e., neighborhood or zonal-level) collision prediction models as empirical tools in road safety diagnosis and planning. These models incorporated an actual bicycle exposure indicator (the number of bicycle kilometers traveled). The macrolevel bicycle- vehicle collisions models were applied at the zonal level to a case study of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Collision-prone zones in Vancouver were identified, and the highest-ranked zones were diagnosed to identify bicycle safety issues and to recommend potential safety countermeasures. The findings from this study suggest that the safety issues may be a result of high density and commercial land use type, coupled with a high traffic volume, particularly on arterial routes, and high bicycle volumes on routes with mixed vehicle and bicycle traffic. The case study demonstrated the use of the models to enhance bicycle safety proactively. nan;ROAD SAFETY","Linking disaster risk reduction, climate change, and the sustainable development goals Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to better link the parallel processes yielding international agreements on climate change, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development.

Net losses in salt marsh areas, both modelled globally and measured regionally, are therefore of concern. Amongst other controls, the persistence of salt marshes in any one location depends on the ability of their substrates to resist hydrodynamic forcing at the marsh front, along creek margins and on the vegetated surface. Where relative sea level is rising, marsh elevation must keep pace with sea-level rise and landward expansion may be required to compensate for areal loss at exposed margins. This paper reviews current understanding of marsh substrate resistance to the near-instantaneous (seconds to hours) forcing induced by hydrodynamic processes. It outlines how variability in substrate properties may affect marsh substrate stability, explores current understanding of the interactions between substrate properties and erosion processes, and how the cumulative impact of these interactions may affect marsh stability over annual to decadal timescales. Whilst important advances have been made in understanding how specific soil properties affect near-instantaneous marsh substrate stability, less is known about how these properties interact and alter bulk substrate resistance to hydrodynamic forcing. Future research requires a more systematic approach to quantifying biological and sedimentological marsh substrate properties. These properties must then be linked to specific observable erosion processes, particularly at the marsh front and along creek banks. A better understanding of the intrinsic dynamics and processes acting on, and within, salt marsh substrates will facilitate improved prediction of marsh evolution under future hydrodynamic forcing scenarios. Notwithstanding the additional complications that arise from morphodynamic feedbacks, this would allow us to more accurately model the future potential protection from flooding and erosion afforded by marshes, while also increasing the effectiveness of salt marsh restoration and recreation schemes. ","Inupiaq Knowledge of Polar Bears (Ursus maritimus) in the Southern Beaufort Sea, Alaska Successful wildlife management depends upon coordination and consultation with local communities. However, much of the research used to inform management is often derived solely from data collected directly from wildlife. Indigenous people living in the Arctic have a close connection to their environment, which provides unique opportunities to observe their environment and the ecology of Arctic species. Further, most northern Arctic communities occur within the range of polar bears (nanuq, Ursus maritimus) and have experienced significant climatic changes. Here, we used semi-structured interviews from 2017 to 2019 to document Inupiaq knowledge of polar bears observed over four decades in four Alaskan communities in the range of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear subpopulation: Wainwright, Utqiagvik, Nuiqsut, and Kaktovik. All but one of 47 participants described directional and notable changes in sea ice, including earlier ice breakup, later ice return, thinner ice, and less multiyear pack ice. These changes corresponded with observations of bears spending more time on land during the late summer and early fall in recent decades-observations consistent with scientific and Indigenous knowledge studies in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Participants noted that polar bear and seal body condition and local abundance either varied geographically or exhibited no patterns. However, participants described a recent phenomenon of bears being exhausted and lethargic when arriving on shore in the summer and fall after extensive swims from the pack ice. Further, several participants suggested that maternal denning is occurring more often on land than sea ice. Participants indicated that village and regional governments are increasingly challenged to obtain resources needed to keep their communities safe as polar bears spend more time on land, an issue that is likely to be exacerbated both in this region and elsewhere as sea ice loss continues.

Ambient PM is a diverse class of air pollution, with characteristics and health implications that can vary depending on a host of factors, including a particle's original source of emission or formation. The penetration of inhaled particles into the thorax is dependent on their deposition in the upper respiratory tract during inspiration, which varies with particle size, flow rate and tidal volume, and in vivo airway dimensions. All of these factors can be quite variable from person to person, depending on age, transient illness, cigarette smoke and other short-term toxicant exposures that cause transient bronchoconstriction, and occupational history associated with loss Of lung function or cumulative injury. The adverse effects of inhaled PM can result from both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) exposures to PM, and can range from relatively minor, such as increased symptoms, to very severe effects, including increased risk of premature mortality and decreased life expectancy from long-term exposure. Control of the most toxic PM components can therefore provide major health benefits, and can help guide the selection of the most human health optimal air quality control and climate change mitigation policy measures. As Such, a continued improvement in our understanding of the nature and types of PM that are most dangerous to health, and the mechanism(s) of their respective health effects, is an important public health goal. particulate matter; lung deposition; morbidity; mortality; climate co-benefits;ASTHMA EMERGENCY VISITS; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; AMERICAN CHILDREN; FINE PARTICLES; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATIONS; PM2.5; DEPOSITION","The role of leadership in regional climate change adaptation: a comparison of adaptation practices initiated by governmental and non-governmental actors This paper aims to better understand the role of leadership in regional climate change adaptation. We first present a framework, which distinguishes five functions of leadership within inter-organizational networks: the connective, enabling, adaptive, political-administrative and dissemination functions. Next, we compare the role of leadership in two examples of regional adaptation practices which were initiated by governmental actors with two examples which were initiated by non-governmental actors. The case studies are located in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. Our research question is twofold: to what extent can the five functions of leadership be identified in practices of climate change adaptation, and are there differences in the patterns of leadership between adaptation practices which are initiated by governmental and by non-governmental actors? The study shows that although all leadership functions were fulfilled in all four cases, patterns of leadership were different and the fulfilment of leadership functions posed different challenges to non-governmental actors and governmental actors. adaptation to climate change; complexity theory; leadership; multi-level governance; water governance;COMPLEXITY; POLICY","The nature and impact of climate change in the Challenge Program on Water and Food (CPWF) basins In this article the authors assess the potential impacts of projected climate change on water, livelihoods and food security in the Basin Focal Projet basins.

The change of land use and land cover (LULC) has considerable impacts on island ecosystems, and there is a critical need for a free and open-source tool for detecting land cover fluctuations and spatial distribution. This study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore land cover classification and the spatial pattern of major land cover change from 1990 to 2019 on Haitan Island, China. The land cover classification was performed using multiple spectral bands (RGB, NIR, SWIR), vegetation indices (NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI), and tasseled cap transformation of Landsat images based on the random forest supervised algorithm. The major land cover conversion processes (transfer to and from) between 1990 and 2019 were analyzed in detail for the years of 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2019, and the overall accuracies ranged from 88.43% to 91.08%, while the Kappa coefficients varied from 0.86 to 0.90. During 1990-2019, other land, cultivated land, sandy land, and water area decreased by 30.70%, 13.63%, 3.76%, and 0.95%, respectively, while forest and built-up land increased by 30.94% and 16.20% of the study area, respectively. The predominant land cover was other land (34.49%) and cultivated land (26.80%) in 1990, which transitioned to forest land (53.57%) and built-up land (23.07%) in 2019. Reforestation, cultivated land reduction, and built-up land expansion were the major land cover change processes on Haitan Island. The spatial pattern of forest, cultivated land, and built-up land change is mainly explained by the implementation of a 'Grain for Green Project' and 'Comprehensive Pilot Zone' policy on Haitan Island. Policy and human activities are the major drivers for land use change, including reforestation, population growth, and economic development. This study is unique because it demonstrates the use of GEE for continuous monitoring of the impact of reforestation efforts and urbanization in an island environment. anthropogenic activities; forest change; GEE; LULC; urbanization;TIME-SERIES; FOREST DISTURBANCE; DERIVATION; DYNAMICS; IMAGES; CHINA","Key Elements of Attentions for Enhancing Urban Resilience: A Comparison of Singapore, Hong Kong and Hangzhou Urban resilience is an attractive concept among academies and governments with the increasing severity of climate change and relevant disasters in cities. Few studies have been conducted to compare the key elements of attentions for enhancing urban resilience among Asian cities, although resilience is context-dependent. This study aims to compare the key elements of attentions for enhancing urban resilience among Singapore, Hong Kong and Hangzhou. A comprehensive literature review and expert interview validation were used to solicit the preliminary elements of attentions for enhancing urban resilience. Planners and researchers in the field of urban planning were surveyed to assess the significance level of the preliminary elements in the three case cities, as professional knowledge is required in the survey. Statistics were used to identify the key elements of attentions in the three case cities. Results demonstrate that the three cities have various elements of attentions for enhancing urban resilience despite sharing many similarities, which also demonstrate the guidance limitation of the general urban resilience framework. It also provides a reference for other international comparisons. urban resilience; elements of attentions; comparison; Asian cities;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; CITIES; CHINA; MODEL; INFRASTRUCTURE; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; SETTLEMENT","Managing Supplier Social and Environmental Impacts with Voluntary Versus Mandatory Disclosure to Investors A buying firm might in the future incur costs associated with a supplier's carbon dioxide emissions, safety violations, or other social or environmental impacts. Learning about a supplier's impacts requires costly effort, but it is necessary (and sometimes sufficient) to reduce those impacts. The capital market valuation of a buying firm reflects investors' estimate of future costs associated with a supplier's impacts, as well as any costs that the buying firm incurs in order to learn about and reduce a supplier's impacts. This paper analyzes a game theoretic model in which a manager-with the objective of maximizing the capital market valuation of the buying firm-decides whether to learn about a supplier's impacts, how much cost to incur to reduce the supplier's impacts, and whether to disclose the supplier's impacts to investors. The investors have rational expectations (e.g., that a manager might withhold bad news about the supplier's impacts ) and value the buying firm accordingly. The paper considers a mandate to disclose information learned about a supplier's impacts. The paper shows that the disclosure mandate deters learning and thus, under plausible conditions, results in higher expected impacts. The disclosure mandate can result in lower expected impacts only if buying firms face moderately high future costs associated with suppliers' impacts. In contrast, a disclosure mandate always increases a buying firm's expected discounted profit and capital market valuation. A disclosure mandate can induce cooperation among buying firms with a shared supplier, yet result in higher expected impacts by the supplier. When a buying firm has alternative suppliers, the disclosure mandate favors commitment to a supplier to facilitate learning about that supplier's impacts (instead of searching for a lower-impact supplier). ","Ongoing and emerging arbovirus threats in Europe During the last decades, arboviruses that are endemic in Europe have expanded their geographic range and caused an increasing number of human outbreaks. These viruses include West Nile virus, which is expanding its area of circulation in central and southern Europe; Usutu virus, with increasing evidence of a role in human disease; tick-borne encephalitis virus, which is being detected in northern areas and at higher altitudes as a consequence of climate warming; Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, which is endemic in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, but has been recently detected in Spain; other viruses, such as California encephalitis virus antigenic group, which circulate in northern and central Europe but whose relevance for human disease in largely unknown. In addition, the rise in global travel and trade has posed Europe to an increased risk of introduction and expansion of exotic arthropod vectors and autochthonous transmission of arboviruses, like dengue and chikungunya viruses, following new introductions from endemic areas. Implementation of integrated arbovirus surveillance programs has been crucial to adopt proper control measures.

Considerable literature highlights that local knowledge can play an important role in climate change adaptation, particularly in small island countries. However, there is less understanding on how to practically integrate and apply local knowledge in climate change adaptation, particularly in the Cook Islands. This research investigated the role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation in the Cook Islands, aiming to understand the role of local knowledge in adaptation policies and the challenges of incorporating local knowledge into climate change adaptation policy through semistructured interviews with key informants and local participants. Key informants often recognized the important role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation while local knowledge was less recognized by local participants. Concerns over both the usefulness of the knowledge today and the loss of this knowledge were expressed. Additionally, challenges to integrating local knowledge into climate change policy were identified, including development pressure, out-migration, and a lack of understanding of local knowledge. This study offers insight into the role of local knowledge in climate change adaptation for other small island countries facing similar challenges.

Shell formation is an extremely complex process requiring a detailed understanding of biomineralization processes. Sodium incorporation into the shells would increase if bivalves rely on the exchange of Na+/H+ to maintain homeostasis for shell formation, thereby shedding new light on the acid-base and ionic regulation at the calcifying front. Here, we investigated the combined effects of seawater pH (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) and temperature (16 and 22 degrees C) on the growth and sodium composition of the shells of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, and the Yesso scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis. Exposure of M. edulis to low pH (7.7 and 7.4) caused a significant decrease of shell formation, whereas a 6 degrees C warming significantly depressed the rate of shell growth in P. yessoensis. On the other hand, while the amount of Na incorporated into the shells of P. yessoensis did not increase in acidified seawater, an increase of Na/Ca-shell with decreasing pH was observed in M. edulis, the latter agreeing well with the aforementioned hypothesis. Moreover, a combined analysis of the shell growth and sodium content provides a more detailed understanding of shell formation processes. Under acidified conditions, mussels may maintain more alkaline conditions favorable for calcification, but a significant decrease of shell formation indicates that the mineralization processes are impaired. The opposite occurs in scallops; virtually unaffected shell growth implies that shell mineralization functions well. Finding of the present study may pave the way for deciphering the mechanisms underlying the impacts of ocean acidification and warming on bivalve shell formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, most studies on CAS have concentrated on management and productivity of the coffee plants with little known about the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. We conducted a study to quantify and compare the SOC stocks among Coffea arabica L. (Arabica coffee), Coffee canephora Pierre ex Froehn (Robusta coffee) agroforestry systems and Coffee monoculture (coffee monocrops) in Uganda. Soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm and tested using routine soil testing procedures. We found that there was higher SOC under CAS than coffee monocrops. When intercropped with non- fruit tree species, Robusta CAS produced higher SOC (57.564 tC/ha) compared to the Arabica CAS (54.543 tC/ha). In contrast, Arabica CAS stored more SOC (54.01 tC/ha) compared to Robusta CAS (49.635 tC/Kg) when intercropped with fruit trees like Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. and Mangifera indica L Under the coffee monocrop systems, Robusta coffee sequestered 4.86 tC/ha more SOC than Arabica coffee. The study showed that a farmer growing Robusta coffee intercropped with non-fruit trees is likely to benefit more from soil carbon credits than a farmer growing Arabica coffee with the same trees. Farmers growing Arabica coffee would sequester more carbon if intercropped with fruit trees. There is need for policy incentives that encourage the planting and maintenance of shade trees in coffee plantations for the benefit of carbon sequestration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Degraded riparian ecosystems are associated with many serious anthropogenic problems including increased river bank erosion, water quality decline, increased flood risk and biodiversity loss. Conventional approaches to riparian restoration, however, are frequently too narrow in focus - spatially, temporally, ecologically and socially - to adequately or equitably address the goals to which they aspire. Climate change, along with the intensification of other human pressures, means that static, historically oriented restoration objectives focused solely on prior ecological composition and structure are unlikely to be defensible, achievable or appropriate in the Anthropocene. Conversely, open-ended restoration strategies lacking clear objectives and targets entail substantial risks such as significant biodiversity losses, especially of native species. A functional approach to planning and prioritising riparian restoration interventions offers an intermediate alternative that is still framed by measurable targets but allows for greater consideration of broader temporal, spatial and cultural influences. Here, we provide an overview of major riparian functions across multiple scales and identify key drivers of, and threats to, these. We also discuss practical approaches to restoring and promoting riparian functions and highlight some key concerns for the development of policy and management of robust riparian restoration in the Anthropocene. climate change; ecosystem services; novel ecosystems; passive regeneration; revegetation; rivers;CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER RESTORATION; FOREST SUCCESSION; FOOD-WEB; MANAGEMENT; FLOODPLAIN; ECOSYSTEMS; LANDSCAPE; STREAM; VEGETATION","A hydrological toolkit to delineate patterns of blue and green water in a regional semi-arid climate in Iran via CMIP5 models Water scarcity and the climate change impacts on water components will drastically alter everybody's life. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been utilized in this study in combination with Sequential Uncertainty Fitting Program (SUFI-2) to simulate precipitation (P), temperature (T), blue water (BW), green water flow (GWF), and green water storage (GWS) in Kashafrood River Basin, Iran. The outputs of two Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models (MIROC-ESM and GFDL-ESM2G) arc selected for hydrological modeling under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of 4.5 and 8.5 and for the near future (2014-2042) and far future (2043-2100) periods compared to historical period (1995-2011). The results of RCPs, in comparison with the historical period, show that P and BW are increased and in GFDL-ESM2G are better than MIROC-ESM, while T tends to increase, and MIROC-ESM is better than GFDL-ESM2G.

In small-scale and medium-scale reservoir-based irrigation schemes in the Upper East region of Ghana, we explored options for improving the traditional, dry season irrigation practices and assessed the potential for supplemental irrigation in the rainy season. The AquaCrop model was used to (i) assess current water management in the typical tomato-maize rotational system; (ii) develop an improved irrigation schedule for dry season cultivation of tomato; and (iii) determine the requirement for supplemental irrigation of maize in the rainy season under different climate scenarios. The improved irrigation schedule for dry season tomato cultivation would result in a water saving of 130-1325 mm compared to traditional irrigation practices, accompanied by approximately a 4-14% increase in tomato yield. The supplemental irrigation of maize would require 107-126 mm of water in periods of low rainfall and frequent dry spells, and 88-105 mm in periods of high rainfall and rare dry spells. Therefore, year-round irrigated crop production may be feasible, using water saved during dry season tomato cultivation for supplemental irrigation of maize in the rainy season.

These are undoubtedly significant challenges for SIDS, including atoll nations such as Kiribati. Nevertheless, securing small island state futures also requires a renewed commitment to addressing the obvious and immediate threats of urbanisation, pollution and sanitation. Looking at pressures of development on freshwater, this article argues that the future survival of small island states and their societies also greatly depends on managing the impacts of development. Approaches which can concurrently strengthen the resilience of communities and their ecosystems will result in mutual benefits for both sustainable development and climate change adaptation.

It is also used in industries for locating and zoning the hazardous areas inside the premises as per the level of hazards. Hazard maps are used mainly for land management, hazard identification, geological surveys for insurance rate adjustments and hazard mitigation. In concern with its industrial and urban planning, hazard mapping is done by all the authority and workers to identify hazard at a particular place, and thus, they learn to develop maps for every hazardous location for identifying and mitigating potential hazards with special emphasis on economic and social parameter. This work is perhaps an attempt to catalogue all the hazardous map systems and techniques for developing hazardous maps associated with sustainable urban planning and industrial development, and suggestions to use hazardous maps for sustainable development have also been touched upon.

In response, improvements in the sustainability of water supplies are feasible through the use of a combination of water sources wherein rainwater harvesting is employed for a portion of the year. This can potentially reduce the duration of the year during which arsenic-contaminated groundwater is utilized. As demonstrated, a rainwater cistern volume of 0.5 m(3) in the Jessore district area of Bangladesh can provide rainwater for periods averaging 266 days of the year, which allows groundwater at 184 mu g/L arsenic to be used as a water supply for the remainder of the year. This dual supply approach provides the body burden equivalent to the interim drinking water guideline of arsenic concentration of 50 mu g/L for 365 days of the year (assuming the water consumption rate is 4 L/cap/day for a family of five with a rainwater collection area of 15 m(2)). If the water use rate is 20 L/cap/day, the same cistern can provide water for 150 days of the year; however, although this is insufficient to supply water to meet the body burden equivalent guideline of 50 mu g/L. Results are provided also for different rooftop areas, sizes of cisterns and alternative arsenic guidelines [World Health Organization (WHO) and Bangladeshi]. These findings provide useful guidelines on supply options to meet sustainability targets of water supply. However, they also demonstrate that the use of cisterns cannot assist the meeting of the 10 mu g/L WHO target arsenic body burden, if the arsenic contamination in the groundwater is high (e. g., at 100 mu g/L). arsenic; Bangladesh; carcinogens; contamination; climate change; groundwater; rainwater harvesting; risk assessment; water supply;nan","Assessing Hydrological Alteration Caused by Climate Change and Reservoir Operations in the San Joaquin River Basin, California Freshwater aquatic ecosystems are highly sensitive to flow regime alteration caused by anthropogenic activities, including river regulation and atmospheric warming-induced climate change. Either climate change or reservoir operations are among the main drivers of changes in the flow regime of rivers globally. Using modeled unregulated and simulated regulated streamflow under historical and future climate scenarios, this study evaluated potential changes to the flow regime due to climate change and reservoir operations for the major tributaries of the San Joaquin River Basin, California United States. We selected a set of Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) to evaluate historical and projected future trends of streamflow dynamics: rise and fall rates, durations and counts of low and high pulses, and the magnitude of extremes. Results show that most indicators have pronounced departures from baseline conditions under anticipated future climate conditions given existing reservoir operations. For example, the high pulse count decreases during regulated flow conditions compared to increased frequency under unregulated flow conditions. Finally, we observed a higher degree of flow regime alteration due to reservoir operations than climate change. The degree of alteration ranges from 1.0 to 9.0% across the basin among all future climate scenarios, while reservoir operations alter the flow regime with a degree of alteration from 8.0 to 25%.

Subsequently, following years of continued single-trait selection, the beef production potential of dairy bred calves has declined. Thus, male HF calves are commonly seen as a by-product of the dairy industry. Limited markets, perceived low economic value and high rearing costs mean that these surplus calves are often euthanised shortly after birth or exported to the EU for further production. Welfare concerns have been raised regarding both euthanasia and long distance transportation of these calves. Furthermore, total UK beef consumption increased by 8.5% from 2009 to 2019. Thus, in light of this growing demand, beef from the dairy herd could be better utilized within the UK. Therefore, the potential for these calves to be used in a sustainable, cost-effective beef production system with high welfare standards within the UK requires investigation. Thus, the aim of this review was to evaluate both steer and bull beef production systems, examining the impact on performance, health, welfare, and economic potential to enable a sustainable farming practice, while meeting UK market requirements. The principal conclusions from this review indicate that there is the potential for these calves to be used in UK based production systems and meet market requirements. Of the steer production systems, a 24 month system appears to achieve a balance between input costs, growth from pasture and carcass output, albeit the literature is undecided on the optimum system. The situation is similar for bull beef production systems, high input systems do achieve the greatest gain in the shortest period of time, however, these systems are not sustainable in volatile markets with fluctuating concentrate prices. Thus, again the inclusion of a grazing period, may increase the resilience of these systems. Furthermore, production systems incorporating a period at pasture are seen to have animal welfare benefits. The main welfare concern for surplus dairy bred calves is often poor colostrum management at birth. While in steer systems, consideration needs to be given to welfare regarding castration, with the negative impacts being minimized by completing this procedure soon after birth.

Few existing climate adaptation frameworks prescribe where to place management actions to be most effective under anticipated future climate conditions. We developed an approach to spatially allocate climate adaptation actions and applied the method to whitebark pine (WBP; Pinus albicaulis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). WBP is expected to be vulnerable to climate-mediated shifts in suitable habitat, pests, pathogens, and fire. We spatially prioritized management actions aimed at mitigating climate impacts to WBP under two management strategies: (1) current management and (2) climate-informed management. The current strategy reflected management actions permissible under existing policy and access constraints. Our goal was to understand how consideration of climate might alter the placement of management actions, so the climate-informed strategies did not include these constraints. The spatial distribution of actions differed among the current and climate-informed management strategies, with 33-60% more wilderness area prioritized for action under climate-informed management. High priority areas for implementing management actions include the 1-8% of the GYE where current and climate-informed management agreed, since this is where actions are most likely to be successful in the long-term and where current management permits implementation. Areas where climate-informed strategies agreed with one another but not with current management (6-22% of the GYE) are potential locations for experimental testing of management actions. Our method for spatial climate adaptation planning is applicable to any species for which information regarding climate vulnerability and climate-mediated risk factors is available.

Mangrove deforestation has resulted in a loss of coastal ecosystem services and associated economic benefits. Quang Ninh is the third largest mangrove area in Vietnam, but has experienced mangrove deforestation and degradation since 1987. The study used historical Landsat-5/8 and Sentinel-2 data to quantify spatial-temporal dynamics of mangrove extent from 1987 to 2020. The CMRI was used to construct LULC and post-classification comparison was used for change detection analysis over the study period. The overall accuracies of 94.8%, 94.1% 92.4%, and 89.9% were recorded in 2020 (Kappa = 0.917), 2017 (Kappa = 0.906), 2010 (Kappa = 0.872), and 2000 (Kappa = 0.832), respectively. The dynamics of mangrove forests in Quang Ninh were influenced by mangrove deforestation and afforestation. The extent of mangrove forests decreased by 2168.3 ha from 1987 to 2020. Mangrove deforestation was mainly caused by unplanned aquaculture, urban development, and other land uses. However, the root of mangrove deforestation is found due to inappropriate regulations and institutional schemes related to mangrove management. The study suggests that community-based mangrove management model and blue carbon approach are suggested in Quang Ninh and Vietnam.& nbsp;","Coordinated primary control reserve by flexible demand and wind power through ancillary service-centered virtual power plant With the steady increase of intermittent renewable power generation in generation portfolio of some power systems with limited hydro power generation and reduced access to synchronized controllable units such as thermal power plants, enabling participation of flexible loads to provide primary control reserve has recently gained attention. In this paper, a virtual power plant (VPP) as an aggregator of demand response (DR) resources and wind farms is developed. It facilitates providing primary control reserve by aggregation of DR resources and coordination of the primary reserve between those aggregated DR and wind farms. As a result, wind farms can be operated with less available capacity allocated for primary control reserve. This approach contributes to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a power system with a high proportion of wind-thermal units in the generation portfolio. Decentralized activation of DR for providing primary control reserve is proposed. For the VPP, an intraday and a near real-time scheduling algorithm in compliance with the German electricity market regulations are devised. The selection method of the DR resources, the adaptive power-frequency droop characteristics of resources, the aggregation process of the resources, and coordination of the primary reserve between wind farms and the DR resources are described. Demand response also effectively contributes to grid frequency stability by providing inertia response to frequency deviations, in addition to the steady-state primary control reserve. The simulation results of a representative high voltage transmission network model confirm the added value of the proposed VPP in enhancing the integration of wind power generation. demand response; droop control; electric vehicle; primary control reserve; reduced network model; thermostatically controlled load; virtual power plant; wind farm;nan","Investigation of aerosol indirect effects using a cumulus microphysics parameterization in a regional climate model A new Zhang and McFarlane (ZM) cumulus scheme includes a two-moment cloud microphysics parameterization for convective clouds. This allows aerosol effects to be investigated more comprehensively by linking aerosols with microphysical processes in both stratiform clouds that are explicitly resolved and convective clouds that are parameterized in climate models. This new scheme is implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting model, coupled with the physics and aerosol packages from the Community Atmospheric Model version 5. A case of July 2008 during the East Asian summer monsoon is selected to evaluate the performance of the new ZM and to investigate aerosol effects on monsoon precipitation. The precipitation and radiative fluxes simulated by the new ZM show a better agreement with observations compared to simulations with the original ZM that does not include convective cloud microphysics and aerosol-convective cloud interactions. Detailed analysis suggests that an increase in detrained cloud water and ice mass by the new ZM is responsible for this improvement. Aerosol impacts on cloud properties, precipitation, and radiation are examined by reducing the primary aerosols and anthropogenic emissions to 30% of those in the present (polluted) condition. The simulated surface precipitation is reduced by 9.8% from clean to polluted environment, and the reduction is less significant when microphysics processes are excluded from the cumulus clouds. Cloud fraction is reduced by the increased aerosols due to suppressed convection, except during some heavy precipitation periods when cloud fraction, cloud top height, and rain rate are increased due to enhanced convection. nan;COMMUNITY ATMOSPHERE MODEL; ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS; CLOUD MICROPHYSICS; PART I; CONVECTIVE CLOUDS; OPTICAL DEPTH; AIR-QUALITY; IMPACT; MONSOON; CHINA","A computable general equilibrium analysis of environmental tax reform in Japan with a forward-looking dynamic model The Japanese government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. However, it is not yet clear which policy measures the government will adopt to achieve this goal. In this regard, environmental tax reform, which is the combination of carbon regulation and the reduction of existing distortionary taxes, has attracted much attention. This paper examines the effects of an environmental tax reform in Japan. Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we analyze the quantitative impacts of an environmental tax reform and clarify which types of environmental tax reform are the most desirable. In the simulation, we introduce a carbon tax and consider the following four scenarios for the use of the carbon tax revenue: (1) a lump-sum rebate to the household, (2) a cut in income taxes, (3) a cut in corporate taxes and (4) a cut in consumption taxes. The first scenario is a pure carbon tax, and the other three scenarios are types of environmental tax reform. Our CGE simulation shows that (1) environmental tax reform tends to generate more desirable impacts than the pure carbon tax and that (2) the strong double dividend is obtained in some cases. In particular, we show that a cut in corporate taxes leads to the most desirable policy in terms of GDP and national income.

Most of the theory underlying these predictions assumes a moving optimum phenotype, with predictions expressed in terms of the temporal variance and auto-correlation of this optimum. However, empirical studies seldom estimate patterns of fluctuations of an optimum phenotype, precluding further progress in connecting theory with observations. To bridge this gap, we assess the evidence for temporal variation in selection on breeding date by modeling a fitness function with a fluctuating optimum, across 39 populations of 21 wild animals, one of the largest compilations of long-term datasets with individual measurements of trait and fitness components. We find compelling evidence for fluctuations in the fitness function, causing temporal variation in the magnitude, but not the direction of selection. However, fluctuations of the optimum phenotype need not directly translate into variation in selection gradients, because their impact can be buffered by partial tracking of the optimum by the mean phenotype. Analyzing individuals that reproduce in consecutive years, we find that plastic changes track movements of the optimum phenotype across years, especially in bird species, reducing temporal variation in directional selection. This suggests that phenological plasticity has evolved to cope with fluctuations in the optimum, despite their currently modest contribution to variation in selection. adaptation; fluctuating environment; fitness landscape; meta-analysis; phenotypic plasticity;CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; DIRECTIONAL SELECTION; EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES; NATURAL-SELECTION; GENETIC-VARIATION; ADAPTATION; TIME; PHENOLOGY; VARIABILITY","Multivariate analyses of Ethiopian durum wheat revealed stable and high yielding genotypes Improving crop adaptation and stability across diverse and changing environmental conditions is essential to increasing grain yield per unit area. In turn, this contributes to meeting the increasing global food demand. Nevertheless, a number of factors challenge the efficiency of crop improvement programs, of which genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) is one of the major factors. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and phenotypic stability of 385 Ethiopian durum wheat landraces and 35 cultivars; assess the pattern of genotype by environment interaction (GEI) effect, and identify stable and high-yielding land-races or cultivars using the additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) and genotype main effect plus genotype by environment interaction biplot (GGE-biplot). The experiment was laid out in an alpha lattice design with two replications at five test sites (Akaki, Chefe Donsa, Holeta, Kulumsa, and Sinana). The combined analysis of variance revealed highly significant effects (P <= 0.01) of environments (E), genotype (G), and GEI on a phenotypic variation of traits evaluated, including grain yield. For all traits, the amount of phenotypic variance and GEI explained by the GGE biplot was higher than in AMMI2, but both exhibited significant effects of E and GEI on the genotypes. The AMMI model identified G169, G420, G413, G139, G415, G416, G417, and G418 as stable genotypes across testing sites. Whereas, the GGE biplot identified G169, G420, G415, G139, G106, G412, G413, and G417 as both high-yielding and stable across test sites. Hence, genotypes identified as stable and high yielding in the present study could be used in a durum wheat breeding program aimed at identifying genes and molecular markers associated with the crop's productivity traits as well as developing stable and high-yielding cultivars for use in East Africa and beyond. nan;X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; GGE BIPLOT ANALYSIS; TRITICUM-TURGIDUM L; GRAIN-YIELD; LANDRACE POPULATIONS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMMI ANALYSIS; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; MODEL SELECTION; SPRING WHEAT","The influence of climate and topography in patterns of territory establishment in a range-expanding bird The Dartford Warbler Sylvia undata has recently expanded its range northwards and upwards in the UK, consistent with the hypothesis that this cold-sensitive species has responded to a warming climate. We interrogated distribution data, collected during four national surveys of this species between 1974 and 2006, to assess whether this large-scale range expansion has been accompanied by finer-scale changes in topographic characteristics of breeding locations. Within sites occupied in successive surveys, there was some evidence of limited altitudinal expansion between surveys. Within wider landscapes occupied in successive surveys, the preceding winter climate tended to be harsher at newly colonized sites than at sites that had already been occupied in the previous survey, while territories in newly colonized sites also tended to be on steeper slopes, especially if at higher altitude, and (in 1994 only) to be more south-facing. Territories in sites that had already been occupied in the previous survey tended to be lower altitude, less steep and more north-facing than territories in newly colonized landscapes. In 2006 only, the winter climate was significantly milder in newly colonized landscapes than in already occupied sites. The combined effects of a changing climate and topography may have influenced the pattern of in-filling in the existing range, while colonization of distant areas, especially more latterly, may have been facilitated by a combination of increased dispersal pressure from the existing range and warming of climate which made higher altitude habitat in the new areas more suitable for occupancy. Careful consideration needs to be given to the importance of fine-scale topographical variation in determining species' responses to climate change in order to underpin robust adaptation strategies. adaptation; aspect; climate change; colonization; dispersal; global warming; niche; slope;DARTFORD WARBLERS; POPULATION; IMPACTS; BOUNDARIES; MOORLAND; UK","Increasing the agricultural, environmental and economic benefits of farming based on suitable crop rotations and optimum fertilizer applications A suitable crop rotation with optimum fertilizer application can balance the need for high crop yields with minimal environmental risk. This has not yet been achieved in China, and the Chinese Government now requires rotations that include a fallow period with the aim of improving soil quality. As a step towards achieving these aims, a 5-year field experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of different rates of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in three typical and acceptable crop rotations on grain yield, nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), N balance and economic benefit at Jiangjin, Chongqing, China. The rotations were rice-flooded fallow (RF), rice-wheat (RW) and maize-wheat (MW). Three fertilizer treatments were tested over five years. The RW rotation with reduced fertilizer application had the highest grain yield and generated the highest economic benefit. The MW rotation was not suitable for the region that we studied because high precipitation can cause serious disease problems for the wheat. The RF rotation with reduced fertilizer application proved to be the best system for ensuring food security, increasing economic benefit and reducing environmental risk.

In this study, we explore how water and resource managers' scales of decision-making and scope of decision responsibilities influence climate information use in two Great Lakes watersheds. We find that despite availability of tailored climate information, actual use of information remains low. Reasons include (a) lack of willingness to place climate on agendas because local managers perceive climate change as politically risky, (b) lack of formal mandate or authority at the city and county scale to translate climate information into on-the-ground action, (c) problems with the information itself, and (d) perceived lack of demand for climate information by those managers who have the mandate and authority to use (or help others use) climate information. Our findings suggest that (1) scientists and information brokers should produce information that meets a range of decision needs and reserve intensive tailoring efforts for decision makers who have willingness and authority to use climate information; (2) without support from higher levels of decision-making (e.g., state), it is unlikely that climate information use will accelerate significantly; and (3) the trend towards characterizing climate specific actions within a broader concept of sustainability practices, or ""adaptation by stealth,"" should be supported as a component of the climate adaptation repertoire. nan;BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; WATER MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; COPRODUCTION; GOVERNANCE; FORECASTS; PERCEPTIONS; USABILITY; POLICY","The impact of climate change on maize yields and its variability in Telangana, India: A panel approach study The present study explores the effect of climate change on maize yields and its variance in Telangana utilizing Just-Pope production function, spanning the period 1956-2015.

The empirical results of the work reveal that the average minimum temperature has a significant unfavorable effect on maize yield in Telangana. Maximum temperature and actual rainfall are positively related with maize yield; however, the maximum temperature is not statistically significant. Furthermore, rainfall and minimum temperature are risk-shrinking factors, but the maximum temperature is a risk-enhancing factor for maize yields during the study period.

Setting the stage for the 2014 World Parks Congress Protected areas are regarded as the most important tool in the conservation toolbox. They cover > 12% of the Earth's terrestrial area, with over half of this designated since 1970, and are thus a unique example of governments and other stakeholders consciously changing management of land and water at a significant scale. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) has a global programme to complete ecologically-representative protected area networks, and this is driving the creation of large numbers of new protected areas. But there is also growing criticism of protected areas because of the social costs of protection and doubts about their effectiveness. We acknowledge this criticism but believe that it is over-stated and applied to a protected area model that has already been replaced by newer thinking. As protected areas are becoming more complex in concept and more complicated in management, we review the six most important changes affecting them over the last 2 decades: (1) a new protected area definition with more emphasis on nature conservation; (2) a plurality of management and governance models; (3) acknowledgement of wider protected area benefits beyond nature conservation; (4) greater social safeguards for protected areas; (5) evidence that protected areas are effective conservation tools; and (6) a new emphasis on larger protected areas, transboundary protected areas, connectivity conservation and landscape approaches.

Also, it will analyse the possibility that Island States could continue having some sort of status analogous to statehood even if it was to lose all territory. Finally, the idea of a ""government-in-exile"" will be discussed, where the State could retain its identity waiting for a future re-emergence of the island. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The rain-fed agriculture system is vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of agricultural production. The impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable agricultural production system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate agricultural production as well as all sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural production under prevailing climate change and variability.

Adaptation and mitigation should therefore be analysed together, as they indeed are, albeit in a rudimentary way, in cost-benefit analyses of emission abatement. However, adaptation and mitigation are done by different people operating at different spatial and temporal scales. This hampers analysis of the trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. An exception is facilitative adaptation (enhancing adaptive capacity), which, like mitigation, requires long-term policies at macro level. Facilitative adaptation and mitigation not only both reduce impacts, but they also compete for resources. ","Adapting crops and cropping systems to future climates to ensure food security: The role of crop modelling Food production systems in the next decades need to adapt, not only to increase production to meet the demand of a higher population and changes in diets using less land, water and nutrients, but also to reduce their carbon footprint and to warmer temperatures and altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change. Crop simulation models offer a research tool for evaluating trade-offs of these potential adaptations and can form the basis of decision-support systems for farmers, and tools for education and training. We suggest that there are four areas in adapting crops and cropping systems that crop modelling can contribute: determining where and how well crops of the future will grow; contributing to crop improvement programmes; identifying what future crop management practices will be appropriate and assessing risk to crop production in the face of greater climate variability.

Despite the growing popularity of glaciers as tourist destinations, up to now only very limited research has been undertaken into this form of tourism. The purpose of this paper is to systematically assess the nature and scope of research into glacier tourism in academic literature and to identify gaps in knowledge in this relatively new field of research. A scoping literature review was conducted of English language academic literature including peer-reviewed articles, reports and academic book chapters, in order to synthesize what is currently known about glacier tourism. From the initially identified 166 sources, 53 sources were ultimately included for review. The greater part of the reviewed literature consists of descriptive empirical studies. The review identified three central themes: perceptions and values of glaciers; the effects of glacier tourism on the social and ecological environment in which it takes place; and climate change and variability. The majority of reviewed studies address the last theme (n = 25). Research on glacier tourism is limited but growing. It deals with a broad scope of topics and addresses glacier tourism in a variety of ways. The literature review demonstrates the need for additional research into several issues, including: (1) designing a coherent conceptual framework that incorporates the main elements of glacier tourism; (2) examining the motives, preferences, experiences and behaviours of glacier tourists, as well as of the motivational push and pull factors of glacier tourism; and (3) conducting cross-area or sub-sector comparative analyses of existing or potential climate-induced impacts on glacier tourism or adaptation strategies and measures.

Across Africa, access to advanced options for increasing maize yields are inadequate. This is daunting as most of the cultivation of maize is in the hands of smallholder farmers who have inadequate access to modern methods of farming. This has resulted in an increase in dependency on harvest area to increase yields. However, it is still unclear how this maize-yield-harvest-area dynamic plays out across different regions of Africa. This study uses crop yield and harvest area time series data from FAOSTAT for the period 1961-2019. The data are analyzed using linear interpolation, the normalization technique, the rate of change, the Pearson correlation coefficient, the coefficient of determination and regression analysis. The results show that maize yields and harvest area have increased by 71.35% and 60.12%, respectively across Africa. Regionally, West, Middle and East Africa witnessed a positive relationship between maize yields and harvest area while in North and Southern Africa, maize yields and harvest area have an inverse relationship. For example, in assessing the relationship between maize yield and harvest area in Africa, this work observes that North Africa has a correlation of -35% and an R-2 of 12%, while Southern Africa has a correlation of -36% and R-2 of 13%. On the other hand, West Africa has a correlation of 87% and an R-2 of 76%, while Middle Africa recorded a correlation of 66% and an R-2 of 42%. East Africa recorded a correlation of 76% and R-2 of 61%. These results confirm that maize yield and harvest area have a positive relationship in West, Middle and East Africa and a negative relationship in North and Southern Africa. These results underscore the fact that in North and Southern Africa, maize production is less dependent on harvest area as is the case in the other regions of Africa. Such findings have implications for adaptation planning especially in sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity is closely related to land and forest degradation. maize; yield; production; harvest area; intensive farming; extensive farming; Africa;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SHIFTING CULTIVATION; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; INTENSIFICATION; SYSTEMS; TRENDS; MODEL","Does funds-based adaptation finance reach the most vulnerable countries? The evolving architecture of global climate change adaptation finance is shifting towards fund mechanisms with competitive application and allocation principles. At the same time, prioritization of the most vulnerable countries is a key goal within this emerging architecture. The paper analyses whether the Green Climate Fund (GCF), by far the largest climate change fund, has so far delivered on its promise to prioritize the most vulnerable countries. For our analysis, we consider the USD 2.5 billion GCF funding allocated until the end of the first mobilization phase and disaggregate it project-by-project into its mitigation and adaptation related amounts. We then analyze the adaptation flows in terms of the recipient country's level of vulnerability and institutional capacity. We further analyze whether funds are being accessed through independent national entities or international intermediaries and whether recipient countries have developing country priority status. The results show that funds-based adaptation finance creates an ambiguous picture: On the one hand, the GCF is on track in allocating its funds largely to country groups which its statutes aim to prioritize, particularly LDCs, African countries and SIDS. At the same time, the proposal process results in the fact that many countries with the highest climate vulnerability but weak government institutions and fragile state-bureaucracies have missed out and not been able to access project funding, mostly LDCs in Africa and conflict-ridden countries. Further, most countries have not yet been able to access project funds independently through their national entities, limiting direct access and country ownership - the strengthening of which is a major goal of the fund. The findings suggest that simplified approval tracks need to be strengthened in the emerging climate finance architecture so that populations in countries with the lowest institutional capacity but highest vulnerability are not being left behind in the long-run.

Place-based communication of climate change may catalyze action by making climate change more personally relevant. However, there is no one general public, so communication efforts can unintentionally polarize beliefs. This study aims to fill the gap in knowledge about how and why different audiences respond to place-based climate change communication, which could aid climate change communication efforts and climate scientists. Results from an experimental survey of 655 Californians and follow-up interviews indicate that prior climate change beliefs influence the effectiveness of place-based climate change communication. In particular, those who were already ""concerned'' about climate change, as classified by the Six Americas, were the only group to show a significant response to an intervention. This study also finds no difference in willingness to adapt to climate change between local and global framings. However, those exposed to a local framing were more likely to take personal-scale adaptation actions, while those exposed to a global framing were more likely to take policy-scale adaptation actions. These results, and the theories of place attachment and psychological distance, suggest that place-based communication may only be applicable for certain audiences (e.g., the concerned) and when the scale of the intervention matches the scale of action. nan;SCIENCE COMMUNICATION; CALIFORNIA DROUGHT; RISK; POLARIZATION; ATTACHMENT; RESPONSES; OPINIONS; EXTREMES; SENSE","Choosing the LID for Urban Storm Management in the South of Taiyuan Basin by Comparing the Storm Water Reduction Efficiency Low impact development (LID) is a storm management philosophy. This paper aims at choosing the LID for urban storm management by comparing the efficiency in the south urban district in the Taiyuan Basin. Firstly, we set up a 1D-2D model to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic process of the area. Then the efficiency of different LID scenarios was analyzed by ratio of surcharging pipeline, percentage of ponding road, external outflow, infiltration, surface runoff, facility storage, and LID area ratio. It was found that the continuous porous pavement and rain garden are beneficial for use in residential and commercial settings in urban areas, and the rain garden performs more effectively and efficiently than the continuous porous pavement. The area occupied by LID might be under 20% of the impervious building area, because the LID performance was not improved significantly with the LID area when the ratio exceeded 20%. The LIDs could be more useful for small return periods and short duration storms, and could not replace conventional runoff management practices and drainage systems. urban storm water management; low impact development; PCSWMM; rain garden; continuous porous pavement;LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; QUALITY; SYSTEM; RIVER; BMPS","Livelihood vulnerabilities and diversification of fishing households in Ghana This article reports on a study that employed the livelihood vulnerability approach and Simpson's diversification index to examine the vulnerability and diversification of fishing households in Ghana, using primary data from 715 households. It found significant differences between the vulnerability indexes of the combined areas below the Akosombo dam and the area upstream of the dam. A majority of the households have diversified their activities. Therefore, policy interventions to make fishing households less vulnerable should focus on households upstream of the Akosombo dam. Policy interventions that enhance the diversification of the fishing households to enable them reduce their income risks are important.

Numerous management strategies and regulations have been developed to monitor and reduce population declines. In Puerto Rico, an administrative order of 1999, regulates a closed season, prohibited the capture of crabs through the year from NPA's and below a minimum size for capture (64 mm). The goal of this research was to monitor spatial-temporal dynamics of crab captures after the implementation of the administrative order. Crabs captured in the Jobos Bay Estuary (JBE) were studied over a 15-year period. The size (carapace width) (CW), sex, and color were documented for 1 531 crabs from 31 crab hunters. Significant temporal difference in crab size was observed (Kruskal Wallis = 46.82, P < 6.187(e-9)), the smallest crabs were captured in 2004 and the largest crabs were captured in 2013. Crab size varied by color (Kruskal Wallis = 86.54, P < 2.2e(-16)), larger crabs were blue, medium sized crabs were brown and smallest crabs were orange. Since color is related to development stage and market value, color can be used as an educational and enforcement tool. There was significant spatial difference in the size of crabs captured (Kruskal Wallis = 252.54, P < 2.2(e-16)), smaller crabs were captured in smaller hunting areas. Only three percent of crabs captured from 2009 to 2018 were below the legal-size limit. Temperature had a weak significant positive relationship with crab size and in years when rainfall was lower smaller crabs were captured. Increases in crab size from 2004 to 2013 coincided with mangrove recovery and the current decrease of crab size coincides with droughts of 2015. Management plans in the Caribbean must include local actions to reduce hunting and climate variability impacts on crab habitat and food availability. spatial and temporal dynamics; climate variability; land crab fishery;CRUSTACEA BRACHYURA GECARCINIDAE; LAND CRAB; LATREILLE; MANGROVE; SIZE","World Regionalization of Climate Change (1961-2010) Traditional climate classification or regionalization characterizes the mean state of climate condition, which cannot meet the demand of addressing climate change currently. We have developed a climate change classification method, as well as the fundamental principles, an indicator system, and mapping techniques of climate change regionalization. This study used annual mean temperature and total precipitation as climatic indices, and linear trend and variation change as change indices to characterize climate change quantitatively. The study has proposed a scheme for world climate change regionalization based on a half century of climate data (1961-2010). Level-I regionalization divides the world into 12 tendency zones based on the linear trend of climate, level-II regionalization resulted in 28 fluctuation regions based on the variation change of climate. Climate change regionalization provides a scientific basis for countries and regions to develop plans for adapting to climate change, especially for managing climate-related disaster or environmental risks.

While increasing numbers of municipalities have revised or developed climate action plans (CAPs), our understanding of the impetus to plan for the climate challenge, processes for creating climate plans, and their resultant form remains limited. Purpose: We analyzed municipal CAPs to understand both their processes and their products, including the extent to which they represent innovation in planning. We ask the following questions: 1) Why do localities decide to undertake climate action planning, and what are the plans' chief drivers and obstacles? 2) How have localities structured their climate action planning processes? 3) How frequently are particular types of actions included in local CAPs, and how do localities determine which to adopt? Methods: We read and evaluated the content of 20 CAPs from municipalities of a range of sizes and locations using a scoring matrix, reconciling coding differences. We also interviewed 16 individuals associated with 15 of the plans and coded notes from these interviews to identify themes relevant to the processes of plan development. Results and conclusions: There is great diversity in what constitutes a CAP. Some plans are motivational documents, while others are extremely detailed implementation plans with concrete goals, clear objectives, and well-reasoned methods. The decision to prepare a CAP reflects the existence of local political will and leadership, which also influences the planning processes used, the form of the resultant plan, and the actions it identifies. We found CAPs to rely heavily on well-known land use and transportation solutions to the climate challenge such as enhanced transit, compact community design, and green building codes, to be implemented both by local government and the broader community. Informants reported that their CAPs favored actions that were highly visible (e.g., tree planting) or produced immediate results (e.g., energy or cost savings from weatherization). Takeaway for practice: The CAPs we studied were special-purpose plans, and planning departments and planning commissions were not central to plan development in the majority of cases reviewed here. We advise professional planners to involve themselves more in CAP processes.

With its Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, the 2030 Agenda stresses the critical role of cities in achieving sustainable development. In the context of SDG17 on partnerships, emphasis is also placed on the role of researchers and other scientific actors as change agents in the sustainability transformation. Against this backdrop, this article sheds light on different pathways through which science can contribute to urban sustainability. In particular, we discern four forms of science-policy-society interactions as key vectors: 1. sharing knowledge and providing scientific input to urban sustainability policy-making; 2. implementing transformative research projects; 3. contributing to local capacity building; and 4. self-governing towards sustainability. The pathways of influence are illustrated with empirical examples, and their interlinkages and limitations are discussed. We contend that there are numerous opportunities for actors from the field of sustainability science to engage with political and societal actors to enhance sustainable development at the local level. cities; science-policy interactions; SDG 11; sustainable development; urban sustainability;REAL-WORLD LABORATORIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CITIZEN SCIENCE; GOVERNANCE; EXPERIENCES; POLICY","The role of geodiversity in delivering ecosystem services and benefits in Scotland The ecosystem services approach is now a key driver for environmental policy and conservation management both in the UK and globally. Within this, geodiversity provides or underpins many essential provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services and so it is not only the inherent value of geodiversity that matters, but also its role in ecosystem functioning. Protecting geodiversity contributes to maintaining the resilience and adaptive capacity of biodiversity and supports critical ecosystem services. In addition, the analysis of palaeoenvironmental archives and geomorphological records provides a key long-term perspective on trends, rates of change and future trajectories in ecosystems and service delivery, an acknowledged gap within the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, as well as informing adaptive management of the effects of climate change, including sea-level rise. Better integration of geodiversity and biodiversity as part of Earth system science is critical for the future-proofing of ecosystems and their services and provides opportunities and challenges for applied geoscience. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE SENSITIVITY; VALUING GEODIVERSITY; QUATERNARY RESEARCH; MANURING PRACTICES; SCOTTISH RIVERS; GREAT-BRITAIN; BIODIVERSITY; FUTURE; CONSERVATION","Cyclone disaster vulnerability and response experiences in coastal Bangladesh For generations, cyclones and tidal surges have frequently devastated lives and property in coastal and island Bangladesh. This study explores vulnerability to cyclone hazards using first-hand coping recollections from prior to, during and after these events. Qualitative field data suggest that, beyond extreme cyclone forces, localised vulnerability is defined in terms of response processes, infrastructure, socially uneven exposure, settlement development patterns, and livelihoods. Prior to cyclones, religious activities increase and people try to save food and valuable possessions. Those in dispersed settlements who fail to reach cyclone shelters take refuge in thatched-roof houses and big-branch trees. However, women and children are affected more despite the modification of traditional hierarchies during cyclone periods. Instinctive survival strategies and intra-community cooperation improve coping post cyclone. This study recommends that disaster reduction programmes encourage cyclone mitigation while being aware of localised realities, endogenous risk analyses, and coping and adaptation of affected communities (as active survivors rather than helpless victims). coastal and island people of Bangladesh; coping; cyclone vulnerability; local response;APRIL 1991 CYCLONE; TROPICAL CYCLONES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARDS; ADAPTATION; PERCEPTION; FLOODPLAIN; HEALTH","Multi-decadal analysis of root-zone soil moisture applying the exponential filter across CONUS This study applied the exponential filter to produce an estimate of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). Four types of microwave-based, surface satellite soil moisture were used. The core remotely sensed data for this study came from NASA's long-lasting AMSR-E mission. Additionally, three other products were obtained from the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (CCI). These datasets were blended based on all available satellite observations (CCI-active, CCI-passive, and CCI-combined). All of these products were 0.25 degrees and taken daily. We applied the filter to produce a soil moisture index (SWI) that others have successfully used to estimate RZSM. The only unknown in this approach was the characteristic time of soil moisture variation (T). We examined five different eras (1997-2002; 2002-2005; 2005-2008; 2008-2011; 2011-2014) that represented periods with different satellite data sensors. SWI values were compared with in situ soil moisture data from the International Soil Moisture Network at a depth ranging from 20 to 25 cm. Selected networks included the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program (25 cm), Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN; 20.32 cm), SNOwpack TELemetry (SNOTEL; 20.32 cm), and the US Climate Reference Network (USCRN; 20 cm). We selected in situ stations that had reasonable completeness. These datasets were used to filter out periods with freezing temperatures and rainfall using data from the Parameter elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). Additionally, we only examined sites where surface and root-zone soil moisture had a reasonably high lagged r value (r > 0.5). The unknown T value was constrained based on two approaches: optimization of root mean square error (RMSE) and calculation based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value. Both approaches yielded comparable results; although, as to be expected, the optimization approach generally outperformed NDVI-based estimates. The best results were noted at stations that had an absolute bias within 10 %. SWI estimates were more impacted by the in situ network than the surface satellite product used to drive the exponential filter. The average Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSs) for ARM ranged from -0.1 to 0.3 and were similar to the results obtained from the USCRN network (0.20.3). NS values from the SCAN and SNOTEL networks were slightly higher (0.1-0.5). These results indicated that this approach had some skill in providing an estimate of RZSM. In terms of RMSE (in volumetric soil moisture), ARM values actually outperformed those from other networks (0.02-0.04). SCAN and USCRN RMSE average values ranged from 0.04 to 0.06 and SNOTEL average RMSE values were higher (0.05-0.07). These values were close to 0.04, which is the baseline value for accuracy designated for many satellite soil moisture missions. nan;NEAR-SURFACE; TEMPORAL STABILITY; SENSOR; MODEL; RETRIEVAL; PRODUCTS; NETWORK; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; VALIDATION","Climate Change and the Adaptation of the Political In the face of climate change, along what path might we attempt transformation that could create a just and livable planet? Recently we proposed a framework for anticipating the possible political-economic forms that might emerge as the world's climate changes. Our framework outlines four possible paths; two of those paths are defined by what is called ""Leviathan,"" the emergence of a form of planetary sovereignty. In this article we elaborate by examining the adaptive character of emergent planetary sovereignty. To grasp this, we need a theory that can see through our ostensibly ""postpolitical"" moment to grasp not the disintegration but the adaptation of the political. What does it mean to say the political adapts? Reduced to its essence, it is to say that if the character of political life prevents a radical response to crisis, then it is the political that must change. A materialist attempt to elaborate on this question must begin by reflecting on the manifest inequalities of power in the current mode of global political-economic regulation. After doing so, we conclude by arguing for a return to the concept of natural history. climate change; sovereignty; theory; futures; political;CARBON; RISK; CATASTROPHE","Carbon offset market methodologies applicable for coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the United States: A review Coastal wetlands have been valued for a variety of ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and long term storage. The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice. The slowly growing demand for carbon offsets in the carbon market could potentially be fulfilled from the blue carbon pool. While this carbon offset is in the early stages, this review may help the inclusion of carbon offset component in the coastal restoration and conservation projects in United States and potentially across the globe.

Regardless of hybrids, predawn water potential (Psi(pd)), net photosynthesis rates, and stomatal conductance decreased similarly upon drought imposition, but the absolute values of these variables were lower in BRS C 2501 than in BRS Manicore . Overall, drought-induced decreases in activities of key enzymes associated with carbon metabolism, including Rubisco, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, and sucrose-phosphate synthase, were stronger in BRS C 2501 than in BRS Manicore. Our data suggest that synthesis of starch (and possibly sucrose) was fundamentally limited by a lower substrate availability rather than by enzymatic constraints, particularly until day 34 after suspending watering. Drought stress provoked similar decreases in biomass accumulation in either hybrid; however, BRS Manicore plants displayed higher total leaf area and root length coupled with greater relative decreases in dry matter of above-ground parts than of roots as compared to BRS C 2501, thereby leading to an increased root-to-above ground ratio in the former. Upon resuming irrigation, the slow recovery of Psi(pd) preceded the recovery of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis irrespective of hybrid. BRS Manicore was better able to recover enzyme activities and carbohydrate status than BRS C 2501. In conclusion, both hybrids could tolerate (or survive) the severe drought conditions, but, overall, BRS Manicore plants were better able to adjust its physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits to cope with drought than did BRS C 2501.

This study analyzed spatio-temporal changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Hulun Lake Basin (HLB) from 1981 to 2019, and explored the relationship between climatic factors and NDVI datasets. Furthermore, the residual trend (RESTREND) method was used to distinguish between the impacts of changes in climate and human activities on vegetation dynamics. The results showed that NDVI of the basin initially increased to the 1990s, then decreased to the mid-2000s, and finally rebounded to 2019 owing to the periodic fluctuations in precipitation. There were 28.32% of the NDVI pixels significantly increasing and 13.85% of the pixels significantly decreasing. The increase proportion of vegetation coverage in forest, wetland and cultivated land was higher than other vegetation types. NDVI in the China Grass Zone (CGZ) significantly degraded by 20.39% compared with the Mongolia Grass Zone (MGZ) significantly degraded by 5.60%. NDVI was significantly correlated with precipitation and weakly correlated with temperature in the HLB, and precipitation was the principal factor influencing vegetation coverage. The results of RESTREND revealed that farmland reclamation, over-grazing, and open-pit mining led to greater browning of vegetation in the CGZ than in the MGZ. Meanwhile, the implementation of ecological protection and restoration projects have helped the greening of the vegetation in the CGZ (20.91%) compared with the MGZ (7.45%). China's ecological restoration projects are important for Mongolia to reverse the trend of serious ecological degradation. Our results can provide scientific decision-making for the local government to formulate differentiated vegetation ecological protection and restoration measures.

About 85% of these are Extensive Green Roofs (EGR). An EGR with several research features was installed on new buildings belonging to the University of Applied Sciences Neubrandenburg in 1999. The results of the almost 20-year permanent survey of the climate effects of the green roof in contrast to gravel roofs are presented here. High-quality sensors, similar to those used by official weather stations, are in use, and data is collected every 10 s and aggregated to hourly values which enable comparisons to official measurements made by the DWD in Neubrandenburg and Berlin. The results show the typical urban heat island effect (UHI) and the mitigation effect of EGR. Whilst the temperature increased over the years due to the urban heat island effect, the temperature within the growing media in the green roof remained constant. The EGR has a stabilization effect of 1.5 K. This is good news for all those seeking a UHI mitigation solution for city centers. In a best-case scenario, the green roof potential of cities in Germany is between 3 and 8%. A value of 50% can be achieved for all buildings; roofs represent about 1/4 of urban surfaces, and the cooling effect of 1.5 K in 20 years is a reasonable contribution to cooling cities and achieving environmental goals by greening urban surfaces. extensive green roofs; climate mitigation; surface temperatures; urban heat island effect; global warming;URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; PERFORMANCE; MANCHESTER; BUILDINGS; SUBSTRATE; SYSTEMS; WALLS","Assessing the effects of seawater temperature and pH on the bioaccumulation of emerging chemical contaminants in marine bivalves Emerging chemical contaminants [e.g. toxic metals speciation, flame retardants (FRs) and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), among others], that have not been historically recognized as pollutants nor their toxicological hazards, are increasingly more present in the marine environment. Furthermore, the effects of environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and pH) on bioaccumulation and elimination mechanisms of these emerging contaminants in marine biota have been poorly studied until now. In this context, the aim of this study was to assess, for the first time, the effect of warmer seawater temperatures (Delta = + 4 degrees C) and lower pH levels (Delta = 0.4 pH units), acting alone or combined, on the bioaccumulation and elimination of emerging FRs (dechloranes 602, 603 and 604, and TBBPA), inorganic arsenic (iAs), and PFCs (PFOA and PFOS) in two estuarine bivalve species (Mytilus galloprovincialis and Ruditapes philippinarum). Overall, results showed that warming alone or combined with acidification promoted the bioaccumulation of some compounds (i.e. dechloranes 602, 604, TBBPA), but also facilitated the elimination of others (i.e. iAs, TBBPA). Similarly, lower pH also resulted in higher levels of dechloranes, as well as enhanced iAs, PFOA and PFOS elimination. Data also suggests that, when both abiotic stressors are combined, bivalves' capacity to accumulate contaminants may be time-dependent, considering significantly drastic increase observed with Dec 602 and TBBPA, during the last 10 days of exposure, when compared to reference conditions. Such changes in contaminants' bioaccumulation/elimination patterns also suggest a potential increase of human health risks of some compounds, if the climate continues changing as forecasted. Therefore, this first study pointed out the urgent need for further research on the effects of abiotic conditions on emerging contaminants kinetics, to adequately estimate the potential toxicological hazards associated to these compounds and develop recommendations/regulations for their presence in seafood, considering the prevailing environmental conditions expected in tomorrow's ocean.

Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is one of the most important forest tree species in Europe potentially prone to climate changes. The northern limit of its distribution is in central Poland but fir stands were planted also in northern part of the country. It gives opportunity to investigate the potential for silver fir to expand into northern (cooler) Europe which could be an important issue in the face of changing climate. The aim of this research was to identify factors influencing the establishment and advancement of silver fir regeneration within and outside its natural range. Using data collected on sample plots in 48 stands, we examined influences of climatic and stand factors on establishment and development of silver fir regeneration. The Boruta algorithm was used to identify variables relevant for particular stages of fir regeneration (short and tall seedlings and saplings). The variable location (indicating that the analysed plot was located inside or outside the natural range of silver fir) was not the most important variable for any size classes of silver fir regeneration (Boruta algorithm). We found that the mean values of diameter of breast height (DBH) and height of the dominant firs were larger for northerly plantations than for stands within the natural range. The density of seedlings was similar within and outside the natural range but density of saplings was lower, especially tall saplings. Climatic variables (continentality index and summer heat: moisture ratio) were significant in the models predicting the probability of establishing tall seedlings and short saplings. Stand composition was an important factor for all the regeneration stages. For short seedlings, local (sample plot) stand composition was important. The establishment of short seedlings was negatively influenced by shade-tolerant species (sum of the heights of the shade-tolerant trees per plot). Species composition at the forest stand spatial scale was more important for tall seedlings and saplings. The proportion of Scots pine in forest stand volume positively influenced the establishment of tall seedlings. We found that with the growth of regeneration, the role of free space availability increased. The occurrence of tall seedlings and saplings was negatively influenced by increased space filling. Introducing silver fir outside of its natural range requires adjustment to management practices such as creation of vertically diversified mixed stands, decreasing stand stocking, regulation of stand species composition. A lack of experience with silver fir silviculture in northern Poland is one of important factors limiting the advancement of regeneration to the stage of high saplings outside the natural range.

However, water resources management using SD is usually in one direction, up to down or down to up, and does not consider internal and external system feedbacks, which may mislead managers and reduce the adaptability of water resources systems. Therefore, dynamic management of a water resources-socioeconomic-environmental (WSE) system based on feedbacks was established in this paper using SD, and a feedback function considering different intensities of feedbacks was proposed. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTHR), China, was chosen as the study area. Three subsystems were included in the WSE system: a socioeconomic subsystem, a water resources subsystem, and an environmental subsystem. We established and compared different dynamic management scenarios with various intensities of feedbacks. The results show that the shortage of water resources and pollution in the BTHR will continue to deteriorate from 2015 to 2030 if no management measures are taken, and the government should direct more attention to reducing the water demand of primary industry and population growth. In addition, we found that the three subsystems in the WSE system influence each other and evolve mutually. In particular, the influence of the water resources subsystem on the environmental subsystem is remarkable and cannot be ignored. This paper may act as a guide for adaptive and multi-objective management of WSE systems.

Total biomass (aboveground + belowground) and carbon in trees were 81.91 +/- 9.04 Mg ha(-1)and 38.47 +/- 4.25 Mg C ha(-1), respectively and contributed 27% of the total ecosystem carbon. Herbs and detritus carbon were 2.34 +/- 0.24 Mg C ha(-1)and 3.64 +/- 0.20 Mg C ha(-1)respectively while cumulative soil organic carbon (SOC) stock ranged from 89.90 +/- 2.16 (January) to 117.91 +/- 3.12 Mg C ha(-1)(August) in the 0-45 cm soil layer. Seasonal microbial biomass carbon (MBC) stock varied from 501.34 to 857.77 mu g g(-1)while annual CO(2)emission (SR) ranged from 112.11-219.29 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1). SOC, MBC and SR exhibited strong seasonality with a peak value in rainy and least in the winter season. Carbon density of trees exhibited a positive and significant relation with tree density (P < 0.05), basal area (P < 0.01) and aboveground biomass (P < 0.01). All the abiotic variables with the exception of bulk density and soil pH showed strong positive and significant relationship with SOC, MBC and SR. Total carbon sequestration of 11.91 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)and release of 3.46 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)resulting to a net ecosystem carbon balance of 8.45 Mg C ha(-1)year(-1)by a traditional agroforestry system suggests that besides provision of livelihood opportunities it can be used as an adaptation strategy in agricultural systems for mitigation of climate change.

Ex P. et C. Laws. and European Pinus sylvestris L. were determined using trees grown under almost identical growing conditions in a mixed stand in Bralitz, Northeast Germany. Single-tree delta C-13 analyses of tree-ring cellulose of both species were carried out at a yearly resolution for the period 1901-2001 and the results compared with growth (basal area increment). Annual mean delta C-13 values for P. ponderosa ranged from -21.6 parts per thousand to -25.2 parts per thousand and for P. sylvestris from -21.4 parts per thousand to -24.4 parts per thousand. Accordingly, C-13 discrimination (Delta) showed higher values for P. ponderosa throughout the investigation period. Five characteristic periods of Delta were identified for both the tree species, reflecting positive and negative influences of environmental factors. Good growing conditions such as after-thinning events had a positive effect on Delta, reflecting higher values, while poor conditions like aridity and air pollution had a negative influence, reflecting lower values. The dynamics of Delta were likewise reflected in the growth (basal area increment, BAI). Higher C-13 discrimination values of P. ponderosa led to higher BAIs of P. ponderosa in comparison with P. sylvestris. Correlation function analyses confirmed that P. sylvestris was more dependent on precipitation than P. ponderosa, which showed a closer relationship with temperature. The results confirm that under predominantly dry growing conditions, P. ponderosa showed better growth performance than P. sylvestris, indicating better common intrinsic water-use efficiency and, therefore, higher rates of net photosynthesis at a given transpiration. In view of the prospect of climate change, the results are very significant for assessing both trees' physiological properties and, hence, their potential for coping with future growing conditions. aridity; basal area increment; carbon isotope discrimination; carbon-13; follow-up; growth; Pinus sylvestris; Pinus ponderosa; tree rings;CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; TREE-RING CELLULOSE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; FRACTIONATION; LEAVES; CHRONOLOGIES; ASSIMILATION","Navigating climate change adaptation assistance for communities: a case study of Newtok Village, Alaska Climate change is significantly impacting Alaska Native Villages (federally recognized tribes) as well as other rural and place-based communities that wish to continue their traditional lifeways. While many communities are looking to state and federal governments for assistance with climate change and other emergencies, there are limits to assistance under the current political and legal framework. This article discusses strategies for climate change adaptation that Alaska Native Villages and similarly situated communities may be able to take on their own. The article acknowledges the limits to these strategies and the gaps likely to remain in adaptation assistance. The article considers the Native Village of Newtok, Alaska, which is relocating to another site as an adaptation to climate change, as a case study in navigating adaptation assistance. While each community is different, several factors that have helped Newtok may benefit other communities: strong leadership; unified community vision and policy; a local coordinator serving as a continued point of contact; strong capacity for grantwriting; trusted, reasonably priced consultants; professional accounting services; and a housing policy to ensure fairness.

As a central agenda-setting actor in the EU, we argue that understanding the institutional capacity for CPI inside the European Commission is especially important for understanding the advancement of CPI in the EU overall. We focus on the inner workings of the Commission, and we ask: what role does the leadership style of the Commission President play in advancing institutional capacity for implementing CPI? We assess the institutional capacity for CPI in the Commission during the Barroso and Juncker Presidencies, which display characteristics of bottom-up and top-down leadership styles, respectively. While we do not find that one presidential leadership style is necessarily 'better' than the other at enhancing institutional capacities for CPI, we highlight important differences along four key factors, namely: (1) political commitment to overarching climate objectives and to the necessity of implementing CPI; (2) recognition of functional overlaps between policy objectives and compatible beliefs for implementing CPI among policymakers; (3) an opportunity structure for innovative policy development and policy entrepreneurship; (4) and meaningful coordination and consultation mechanisms.

Consequences of victimisation in school BackgroundMainly Western studies suggest that bullying increases risk of subsequent offending. Less is known about risk of violence specifically. Very little such research is from Asia - none from Korea. AimThis study aimed to answer three research questions: Is being a victim of bullying in Korean schools associated with later perpetration of violent behaviour? Does type of bullying influence type of offending? Does school climate or parental control mediate this relationship? MethodJuvenile justice intake officers identified 606 young offenders who were asked to complete questionnaires about their school experience, school climate and parental supervision. We used multinomial logit model with maximum likelihood estimation to evaluate relationships between the variables of interest. ResultsOver half (310) of these young people had committed at least one violent offence. Seventy-six (13%) reported having experienced emotional bullying at school and 31 (5%) physical bullying. Violent offending was over twice as likely as property offending to be associated with emotional bullying history (OR 2.38, CI 1.13-5.01), but three times less likely with physical bullying (OR 0.31, CI 0.11-0.87). In addition, parental control (but not school climate) increased the likelihood of violent offending or other delinquency by 15% (OR 1.14, CI 1.02-1.26; OR 1.16, CI 1.01-1.32, respectively). Conclusions/ImplicationsOur overarching finding of a relationship between childhood experience of bullying and later delinquency is in line with Western findings. Where, however, the latter are equivocal on risk of later violence perpetration, we found that being emotionally bullied raises the risk of becoming violent. Our findings also underscore the importance of having studies from a range of cultures. Predictions from Western studies would be that parental control would be protective and school climate a potential risk factor for later violence, but, in Korea, where parenting styles tend to be highly authoritarian, we found differently. Copyright ","Workplace heat stress, health and productivity - an increasing challenge for low and middle-income countries during climate change Background: Global climate change is already increasing the average temperature and direct heat exposure in many places around the world. Objectives: To assess the potential impact on occupational health and work capacity for people exposed at work to increasing heat due to climate change. Design: A brief review of basic thermal physiology mechanisms, occupational heat exposure guidelines and heat exposure changes in selected cities. Results: In countries with very hot seasons, workers are already affected by working environments hotter than that with which human physiological mechanisms can cope. To protect workers from excessive heat, a number of heat exposure indices have been developed. One that is commonly used in occupational health is the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). We use WBGT to illustrate assessing the proportion of a working hour during which a worker can sustain work and the proportion of that same working hour that (s)he needs to rest to cool the body down and maintain core body temperature below 38 degrees C. Using this proportion a 'work capacity' estimate was calculated for selected heat exposure levels and work intensity levels. The work capacity rapidly reduces as the WBGT exceeds 26-30 degrees C and this can be used to estimate the impact of increasing heat exposure as a result of climate change in tropical countries. Conclusions: One result of climate change is a reduced work capacity in heat-exposed jobs and greater difficulty in achieving economic and social development in the countries affected by this somewhat neglected impact of climate change. climate change; work; heat; occupational health; productivity;nan","Diversification and labor productivity on US permaculture farms The relationship between diversification and labor productivity is a pressing issue for diversified farming systems (DFS), which must compete with the high labor productivity of specialized and mechanized industrial farming systems. Synergies between multiple production systems represent an alternative pathway for enhancing labor productivity, contrasting with the economies of scale achieved by industrial farming. Facing a lack of technical and institutional support for managing diversified systems, DFS turn to grassroots agroecological networks for support. Permaculture is a grassroots network with an emphasis on diversified production that-despite its international scope and high public profile-has received little scholarly attention. In this exploratory study we assessed the relationship between diversification, labor productivity and involvement with permaculture, using data from 196 enterprises (i.e., distinct sources of income or aspects of a farm business) on 36 permaculture farms in the USA. We characterized diversification in two ways: by income at the level of the whole farm, and by labor for production enterprises only. By fitting a multilevel model of labor productivity (enterprises nested within farms) we assessed the evidence for synergies in production, i.e., positive relationships between diversification and returns to labor. Results indicated that both production diversity and level of involvement in the permaculture network had significant positive effects on labor productivity. This effect disappeared, however, when both diversity and participation were at their highest levels. Results also indicate that high levels of diversification shift tree crops from the lowest labor productivity of any type of production enterprise to the highest. Through this first ever (to our knowledge) systematic investigation of permaculture farms, our results provide support for the presence of production synergies in DFS, and for the role of permaculture in helping farmers achieve these synergies.

In turn, a reduction in costs and increases in ease of construction and rate of implementation have led to sand-filled geotextile elements, such as bags, tubes, and containers, becoming an alternative or supplement to traditional coastal defence materials, such as rubble mounds, concrete, and so on. Not all coastal zones are appropriate for sand-filled geotextile structures as coastal defences. This article analyses suitable zones for locating geotextile bag revetments to protect coasts from storm erosion and concludes that the least suitable zones are the surf zone (on an open coast and on a slightly protected coast) and deep water (on an open coast), except if a suitable reinforcement is carried out when the demand makes it necessary this build this kind of defence.

This creates the need to extend these approaches by means of suitable tools that can help sequence actions and subsequently enable the outlining of relevant policies. This paper presents two sequencing approaches, namely, the ""Build to Target"" and ""Build Up"" approach, to aid in sub-selecting a set of preferred pathways. Both approaches differ in the levels of flexibility they offer. They are exemplified by means of two case studies wherein the Net Present Valuation and the Real Options Analysis are employed as selection criterions. The results demonstrate the benefit of these two approaches when used in conjunction with the adaptation pathways and show how the pathways selected by means of a Build to Target approach generally have a value greater than, or at least the same as, the pathways selected by the Build Up approach. Further, this paper also demonstrates the capacity of Real Options to quantify and capture the economic value of flexibility, which cannot be done by traditional valuation approaches such as Net Present Valuation. deep uncertainty; Real Options Analysis; sequencing approaches;URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SYSTEMS; DESIGN; RISK; ADAPTATION; PATHWAYS; SUSTAINABILITY; FLEXIBILITY; EXPANSION","The strategies and effectiveness of climate adaptation for the thousand pillars dwelling based on passive elements and passive spaces Relying on passive climate-responsive strategies, traditional dwellings can effectively control the indoor thermo-hygrometric and daylighting conditions by taking advantage of some favorable climatic elements like wind, solar radiation, etc. Furthermore, the building's elements and spaces can be regulated to make the indoor microclimate reach the comfort limits thanks to these passive strategies. In this paper, the Thousand Pillars Dwelling (TPD) is taken as a research objective to explore its climate adaptation strategies and effectiveness for the local climate in the view of passive elements (PEs) and passive spaces (PSs). By the methodologies of literature reviews, field investigations and software simulations, the buffer effect (BE) created by PEs (composed of doors, windows, walls etc.) and PSs (composed of patios, corridors etc.) contributing to the improvement of indoor comfort level (ICL) is researched qualitatively. An additional study on in-situ measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and illuminance in diverse parts of TPD was carried out to research their effectiveness of climate adaptation quantitatively. This study shows that BEs are effective at mitigating the impact of outdoor climate on internal spaces, which is helpful for the extension of indoor comfort time (EICT) by 3472 h per year. The research results of passive strategies are summarized from the study case of TPD and its effectiveness of climate adaptation can provide some methods and implications to create more comfortable indoor environments for rural residences.

The EU?s ambition is to position Europe as the world leader in NBS Research (via scientific research aiming at generating knowledge and theories) and Innovation (NBS implementation via identifying innovative approaches and best practices), as well as in a global market (for sharing, communicating, collaborating and promoting NBS). Considerable efforts have been made by the European Commission (the executive branch of the EU) as featured in a number of documents, funding programmes and Horizon 2020 (Research and Innovation) projects that span the period from 2012 to 2020. While the European Commission?s commitment to promoting NBS within its Member States and beyond is still an ongoing process, we aim to review the efforts undertaken, knowledge gained, and practices accomplished. This roadmap intends to provide interested practitioners, policymakers, researchers, as well as civil organisations with an updated understanding of the leading role of the EU in NBS conceptualisation and operationalisation. This can inform future directions of NBS Research and Innovation actions, which in turn address environmental and societal challenges prompted by urbanisation/re-urbanisation, globalisation/de-globalisation, climate change and, more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic.

We tested the hypothesis that the time to the onset of the phenological stages (TOPS) occurred earlier due to climate change and analyzed the consequences for farmers. Weather and phenological data from 1970 to 2018 were statistically processed. There was a rise in air temperature (T) during January through May, with a significant increase in March and April. Inverse linear relationships were found between TOPS and time, as well as between TOPS and some climate variables: maximum, mean and minimum T, and sunshine hours. There is an advance in the first three phenological stages, with stage 51 as the earliest. The impact is important in relation to insect pollination, pesticide application, and occurrence of climate accidents due to late frost. Insect pollination does not always occur simultaneously with the flowering of trees in spring. Rain and cold temperatures can interfere with pollination. Application of pesticides in orchards should be adjusted according to the weather course. Farmers should consider additional pesticide treatments to hamper development of specific pests and diseases. They should adjust irrigation scheduling and perhaps harvesting time. These results might be useful for farmers in other countries with similar environments.

However, despite the wide-spread prevalence of process-based evaluation in climate science practice, this sort of model evaluation has been undertheorized by philosophers of science. In this paper, I aim to expand this narrow philosophical view of climate model evaluation by providing a philosophical account of process evaluation that is rooted in a close examination of scientific practice. I propose dynamical adequacy as a metric by which scientists test and evaluate models that represent and produce key regional climate processes and features. I argue that process-based evaluation confirms the adequacy of a regional climate model for simulating and predicting future changes of a specific regional climate feature. I offer a case study of how, in practice, scientists establish the reliability of model projections by assessing the dynamical adequacy of such models. I also show how process-based evaluation mitigates some well-known shortcomings of model-fit assessment and supports the adequacy and reliability of climate model projections against philosophical objections, like confirmational holism. Such adequacy is especially important for decision makers who need reliable regional model projections to guide their climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.

Much of the knowledge about the timing of dune accumulation in the Thar stems from scattered and sporadic records, based on older luminescence dating protocols. If the Thar dune record is to be incorporated within a growing multiproxy framework of past climate and environmental dynamics, it is necessary to generate a systematic record of the timing of dunefield accumulation. From this, relationships to climate and other drivers of dune activity may then be better established. To this end, an intensive programme of field sampling and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was carried out from a dunefield in the east-central Thar Desert. This study presents the first detailed Holocene dune accumulation history from the region, and sheds light on the development of the multi-generational parabolic dune systems. In contrast to previously published work, we identify the importance of the Holocene and the last millennium as periods with a number of preserved accumulation phases. OSL ages suggest that accumulation was persistent during the early and mid-Holocene (within 11.7-5.5 ka), late Holocene (2-1 ka), as well as two major phases in the last millennium (600 - 200 a and within the last 70 a). Potential drivers of dune mobility in the last century include a strong anthropogenic dimension. Rapid net accumulation is recorded in the last 70 years, with rates varying between 2 and 5 m/year, in an environment where agricultural pressures have increased dramatically with the advent of irrigation schemes expanding into dunefield areas. ","An analysis of iLUC and biofuels - Regional quantification of climate-relevant land use change and options for combating it The study proposes a regional approach to calculating indirect land use change (iLUC). The goal is to determine the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of biofuels brought about by iLUC in a specific region. A regional approach can be based on the conditions specific to the respective region and the data for this region which, is contained in country statistics. This makes the results more resilient. It also appears that LUC is mainly caused locally or regionally. Relevant policy scenarios for different regions were calculated with a regional model. The calculations show reliable results. It is possible to introduce such a regional model in regulations for combating iLUC. The analysis of the policy options for combating iLUC shows that a regional approach would have a much more effective steering effect. biofuels; indirect land use change;nan","Is MSW derived DME a viable clean cooking fuel in Kolkata, India? An important energy poverty reduction initiative in India is aimed at replacing the use of solid cooking fuels with cleaner burning Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG). Projections suggest however that India will become increasingly dependent on LPG imports, the cost of which is strongly linked to the prevailing oil price and associated volatility. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a synthetic fuel which may be manufactured from domestically available carbonaceous feedstocks, and is compatible with blending with LPG. Very large quantities of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) are generated in India's metropolitan cities, 90% of which is disposed of onto unsanitary landfills, creating major environmental and health concerns. This article investigates the techno-economic merits of reducing these impacts by using a portion of the MSW generated in Kolkata (in the form of a Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF)) to produce DME. Results suggest that the production of DME from a 50:50 blend of locally available coal and RDF (comprising 10% of the MSW placed at Kolkata's main landfill) will enable the supply of a clean cooking fuel to approximately 15% of Kolkata's population, and become cost competitive with imported LPG at an Indian basket oil price of $130 per barrel. Results also suggest that, at this blend ratio, the fossil fuel derived greenhouse gas emissions at the DME production plant will be more than offset by landfill methane emissions avoided using the RDF.

Previous studies found that spatial pattern (composition and configuration) of impervious surfaces affected urban waterlogging. However, their relative importance remains unknown, and the scale-effect of the spatial pattern on urban waterlogging has been ignored. To move forward, our research studied the relationship between spatial patterns on the impervious surface and its subcategories (building and pavement) on urban waterlogging risk spots using Pearson correlation, partial redundancy analysis and performed at three grid scales (1 km x 1 km, 3 km x 3 km, 5 km x 5 km) and the catchment scale based on different spatial resolution land cover maps (2 m, 10 m and 30 m). We identified positively-correlated metrics with urban waterlogging risk spots, such as the composition of impervious surface (i.e., total impervious surface, building, pavement) and the aggregation metric of the total impervious surface at most scales, as well as two negatively correlated metrics (i.e., proximity metric of building, fragmentation metric of total impervious surface). Furthermore, the total variance of urban waterlogging risk spots explained by the spatial pattern of the total impervious surface and its subcategories increased with studied grid and catchment scales while decreasing from a fine to a coarse resolution. The relative contribution of the impervious surface composition and configuration to the variation of urban waterlogging risk spots varied across scales and among impervious surface types. The composition contributed more than the configuration did for the total impervious surface at both grid and catchment scales. Similar to total impervious surface, the composition of buildings was more important than its configuration was at all the grid scales, while the configuration of buildings was more important at the catchment scale. Contrary to the total impervious surface, the configuration of pavement at both the grid and catchment scales mattered more than their compositions did. Furthermore, the composition of the building was more important than that of pavement, but its configuration mattered less. Our study could provide a multi-scale landscape perspective with detailed suggestions for controlling the area of impervious surface and optimizing its spatial configuration in urban waterlogging risk mitigation and urban planning. impervious surface; landscape metrics; urban waterlogging; multiple scales; partial redundancy analysis;LAND-USE CHANGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM-RUNOFF; HYDROLOGIC RESPONSE; LANDSCAPE PATTERN; RIVER-BASIN; IMPACT; HETEROGENEITY; CATCHMENT; METRICS","Temporal and spatial variations of high-impact weather events in China during 1959-2014 The variation and trend in the frequency and duration of four types of high-impact weather (HIW) events were examined using daily surface climate data and linear regression method, and results show that for both the frequency and the duration, the trends of hot weather events were not significant in most parts of China, though for the China as a whole, they had increased with rates of 0.4 days and 0.1 spells of hot weather per decade respectively. The frequency of cold weather events had decreased significantly in most parts of China, particularly in northern, northeastern, and western China, where it increased at rates of 2-8 days per decade in most stations, but the duration of cold weather events were not significant in most parts of China. The frequency of gale weather events had decreased in almost all of China, with a rate of 3.7 days per decade for the China as a whole, and the duration of gale weather events had decreased mainly in northeastern and northern China, western Xinjiang, southwestern Sichuan, and some coastal areas of Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The frequency of rainstorm weather events was not significant in most parts of China, and the duration of rainstorm weather events was not significant in the whole of China. With global climate change, there would be an increase in the hot and rainstorm weather events, so mitigation/adaptation strategies for such weather events are essential for local government and social public. nan;EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; DAILY PRECIPITATION; AIR-TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; PROJECTION","Contributions of Climate Variability and Human Activities to Runoff Changes in the Upper Catchment of the Red River Basin, China Quantifying the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes will contribute to regional water resource planning and management. This study aims to separate the effects of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the upper catchment of the Red River Basin in China. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test methods were applied to identify the trends and change points of the hydro-meteorological variables. The hydrological sensitivity, climate elasticity and hydrological simulation methods were adopted to estimate the contributions of climate variability and human activities to runoff changes. Results showed that annual runoff significantly decreased by 1.57 mm/year during the period of 1961-2012. A change point in annual runoff coefficient occurred in 2002. Accordingly, the annual runoff series were divided into the baseline period (1961-2002) and the impacted period (2003-2012). Mean annual runoff of the impacted period decreased by 29.13% compared with the baseline period. Similar estimates of the contributions of climate variability and human activities were obtained by the three different methods. Climate variability was estimated to be responsible for 69%-71% of the reduction in annual runoff, and human activities accounted for 29%-31%. Climate variability was the main driving factor for runoff decrease in the catchment. climate variability; human activities; runoff change; hydrological sensitivity; climate elasticity; hydrological simulation; Red River;QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT; ARID REGION; STREAMFLOW; IMPACT; WATER; UNCERTAINTY; ATTRIBUTION; DISCHARGE; YELLOW; MODEL","Household and Community Social Capital Links to Smallholder Food Security Agricultural adaptation to climate change is critical for ensuring future food security. Social capital is important for climate change adaptation, but institutions and social networks at multiple scales (e.g., household, community, and institution) have been overlooked in studying agricultural climate change adaptation. We combine data from 13 sites in 11 low-income countries in East Africa, West Africa, and South Asia to explore how multiple scales of social capital relate to household food security outcomes among smallholder farmers. Using social network theory, we define three community organizational social network types (fragmented defined by lack of coordination, brokered defined as having a strong central actor, or shared defined by high coordination) and examine household social capital through group memberships. We find community and household social capital are positively related, with higher household group membership more likely in brokered and shared networks. Household group membership is associated with more than a 10% reduction in average months of food insecurity, an effect moderated by community social network type. In communities with fragmented and shared organizational networks, additional household group memberships is associated with consistent decreases in food insecurity, in some cases up to two months; whereas in brokered networks, reductions in food insecurity are only associated with membership in credit groups. These effects are confirmed by hierarchical random effects models, which control for demographic factors. This suggests that multiple scales of social capital-both within and outside the household-are correlated with household food security. This social capital may both be bridging (across groups) and bonding (within groups) with different implications for how social capital structure affects food security. Efforts to improve food security could recognize the potential for both household and community level social networks and collaboration, which further research can capture by analyzing multiple scales of social capital data. climate change; agriculture; network analysis; social networks; food security; organization;LOCAL COLLECTIVE ACTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AGRICULTURAL ADAPTATION; INCOME COUNTRIES; FARM HOUSEHOLDS; INSECURITY; GOVERNANCE; INNOVATION; NETWORKS; INTERVENTIONS","Human Migration in the Era of Climate Change Migration is one response to climatic stress and shocks. In this article we review the recent literature across various disciplines on the effects of climate change on migration. We explore key features of the relationship between climate change and migration, distinguishing between fast-onset and slow-onset climatic events and examining the causes of heterogeneity in migratory responses to climate events. We also seek to shed light on the interactions between different types of adaptations to climate events as well as the mechanisms underlying the relationship between climate change and migration. Based on our review of the existing literature, we identify gaps in the literature and present some general policy recommendations and priorities for research on climate-induced migration. ","Intensive field sampling increases the known extent of carbon-rich Amazonian peatland pole forests Peatland pole forest is the most carbon-dense ecosystem in Amazonia, but its spatial distribution and species composition are poorly known. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified variation in the floristic composition, peat thickness, and the amount of carbon stored above and below ground of 102 forest plots and 53 transects in northern Peruvian Amazonia. This large dataset includes 571 ground reference points of peat thickness measurements across six ecosystem types. These field data were also used to generate a new land-cover classification based on multiple satellite products using a random forest classification. Peatland pole forests are floristically distinctive and dominated by thin-stemmed woody species such as Pachira nitida (Malvaceae), Platycarpum loretense (Rubiaceae), and Hevea guianensis (Euphorbiaceae). In contrast, palm swamps and open peatlands are dominated by Mauritia flexuosa (Arecaceae). Peatland pole forests have high peat thickness (274 +/- 22 cm, mean +/- 95% CI, n = 184) similar to open peatlands (282 +/- 46 cm, n = 46), but greater than palm swamps (161 +/- 17 cm, n = 220) and seasonally-flooded forest, terra firme, and white-sand forest where peat is rare or absent. As a result, peatland pole forest has exceptional carbon density (1,133 +/- 93 Mg C ha(-1)). The new sites expand the known distribution of peatland pole forest by 61% within the Pastaza-Maranon Foreland basin, mainly alongside the Tigre river, to cover a total of 7540 km(2) in northern Peruvian Amazonia. However, only 15% of the pole forest area is within a protected area, whilst an additional 26% lies within indigenous territories. The current low levels of protection and forest degradation but high threat from road paving projects makes the Tigre river basin a priority for conservation. The long-term conservation of peatland pole forests has the potential to make a large contribution towards international commitments to mitigate climate change. carbon density; dominant species; Google Earth Engine; indigenous communities; natural resources; peatland degradation; RAMSAR sites;MAURITIA-FLEXUOSA; INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES; TROPICAL PEATLANDS; RIO TIGRE; BASIN; DEGRADATION; EXTRACTION; BIOMASS; LORETO; PALMS"
"5","A Continental Scale Assessment of Australia's Potential for Irrigation Debate about irrigation development of water resources in northern Australia has been hampered by a lack of quantitative information to enable accurate assessment of the volume of water that could potentially be regulated in the 'North' (north of the tropic of Capricorn). Too often the debate focuses solely on streamflow volumes and quantities of runoff. In this paper we present simple calculations to estimate a representative irrigation requirement and the potential exploitable yield in each of the 12 drainage divisions of Australia in order to more fully inform this on-going debate. Environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations are not examined. The results indicate that, despite northern Australia generating approximately 64% of the continent's runoff, only 45% of Australia's potentially exploitable yield is located in that portion of Australia, due to unfavourable streamflow characteristics, storage constraints and large evaporation losses. If exploitable yield and irrigation requirement were the sole factors constraining sustainable irrigation, under a full development scenario, southern Australia could hypothetically support an area of irrigation about 60% greater than that of northern Australia (based on only 36% of the country's runoff). Using 'best estimates' of rainfall and evapotranspiration projected under changes in climate resulting from a moderate emissions scenario, the percentage of Australia's exploitable yield located in northern Australia is estimated to increase from 45% to 47% by the year 2050, which equates to a 2% increase to the percentage of Australia's hypothetical area of irrigation that could be located in northern Australia. These results suggest that efforts towards achieving and developing sustainable irrigation practices in the South will remain most important in achieving Australia's long term irrigation potential. This study also highlights the need for better regional scale information on the potential to regulate streamflow in Australia, under current and future climates. Such information is essential to guide policy and planning, future Government and private investment, and to manage community expectations of Australia's water resources.

We forecasted the distribution of extant European large mammals (17 carnivores and 10 ungulates) based on 2 Rio+20 scenarios of socioeconomic development: business as usual and reduced impact through changes in human consumption of natural resources. These scenarios are linked to scenarios of land-use change and climate change through the spatial allocation of land conversion up to 2050. We used a hierarchical framework to forecast the extent and distribution of mammal habitat based on species' habitat preferences (as described in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List database) within a suitable climatic space fitted to the species' current geographic range. We analyzed the geographic and taxonomic variation of habitat loss for large mammals and the potential effect of the reduced impact policy on loss mitigation. Averaging across scenarios, European large mammals were predicted to lose 10% of their habitat by 2050 (25% in the worst-case scenario). Predicted loss was much higher for species in northwestern Europe, where habitat is expected to be lost due to climate and land-use change. Change in human consumption patterns was predicted to substantially improve the conservation of habitat for European large mammals, but not enough to reduce extinction risk if species cannot adapt locally to climate change or disperse. Escenarios de Perdida de Mamiferos Mayores en Europa para el Siglo XXI Las distribuciones y poblaciones de los mamiferos grandes estan declinando a nivel global, lo que conlleva un aumento en el riesgo de su extincion. Pronosticamos la distribucion de los mamiferos europeos existentes (17 carnivoros y 10 ungulados) con base en dos escenarios Rio+20 de desarrollo socio-economico: la normalidad y el impacto reducido a traves de los cambios en el consumo humano de los recursos naturales. Estos escenarios estan conectados a escenarios de cambio en el uso de suelo y cambio climatico por medio de la asignacion espacial de la conversion de suelo hasta el ano 2050. Usamos un marco de trabajo jerarquico para pronosticar la extension y la distribucion de los habitats de los mamiferos con base en las preferencias de habitat de las especies (como se describe en la base de datos de la Lista Roja de la Union Internacional para la Conservacion de especies) dentro de un espacio climatico adecuado para acomodar a las especies en su extension geografica actual. Analizamos la variacion geografica y taxonomica de la perdida de habitat para los mamiferos mayores y el efecto potencial de la politica de impacto reducido sobre la mitigacion de perdidas. En los escenarios en promedio, se predijo que los mamiferos mayores de Europa perderian el 10% de su habitat para 2050 (25% el peor de los casos). La perdida pronosticada fue mucho mas alta para las especies en el noroeste de Europa, en donde se espera perder habitats debido al cambio climatico y de uso de suelo. Se pronostico que los cambios en los patrones de consumo humano mejorarian considerablemente la conservacion del habitat de los grandes mamiferos de Europa, pero no lo suficiente para reducir el riesgo de extincion si las especies no se pueden adaptar localmente al cambio climatico o a la dispersion.

Spatially explicit simulations of landscape dynamics provide quantitative estimates of landscape structure and allow for the testing of alternative scenarios. We used a landscape fire succession model to estimate the historical range of variability of vegetation and fire in a dry forest landscape (size ca. 7900 km(2)) where the present-day risk of high severity fire threatens the persistence of older closed canopy forest which may serve as Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat. Our results indicated that historically, older forest may have comprised the largest percentage of the landscape (similar to 35%), followed by early successional forest (similar to 25%), with about 9% of the landscape in a closed canopy older forest condition. The amount and condition of older forest varied by potential vegetation type and land use allocation type. Vegetation successional stages had fine-grained spatial heterogeneity in patch characteristics, with older forest tending to have the largest patch sizes among the successional stages. Increasing fire severities posed a greater risk to Northern Spotted Owl habitat than increasing fire sizes or frequencies under historical fire regimes. Improved understanding of historical landscape-specific fire and vegetation conditions and their variability can assist forest managers to promote landscape resilience and increases of older forest, in dry forests with restricted amounts of habitat for sensitive species.

Understanding the genetic and environmental factors that mitigate coral bleaching susceptibility may aid local management efforts to help coral reefs survive climate change. Although bleaching susceptibility depends partly on the genetic identity of a coral's algal symbionts(2), the effect of symbiont density, and the factors controlling it, remain poorly understood. By applying a new metric of symbiont density(3) to study the coral Pocillopora damicornis during seasonal warming and acute bleaching, we show that symbiont cell ratio density is a function of both symbiont type and environmental conditions, and that corals with high densities are more susceptible to bleaching. Higher vulnerability of corals with more symbionts establishes a quantitative mechanistic link between symbiont density and the molecular basis for coral bleaching, and indicates that high densities do not buffer corals from thermal stress, as has been previously suggested(4). These results indicate that environmental conditions that increase symbiont densities, such as nutrient pollution(5,6), will exacerbate climate-change-induced coral bleaching, providing a mechanistic explanation for why local management to reduce these stressors will help coral reefs survive future warming. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; STYLOPHORA-PISTILLATA; OXIDATIVE STRESS; SYMBIODINIUM; PATTERNS; ACCLIMATION; POPULATION; ADAPTATION; ECOLOGY","Assessing the effects of flood resilience technologies on building scale The impacts of floods on housing are increasing due to more frequent and severe weather events as well as the ongoing development of settlements in flood-prone areas together with the rising vulnerability of assets at risk. Therefore, the improvement of the resilience properties of buildings to better cope with flooding has become a key issue towards more flood resilient cities in European research in recent years. The implementation of flood resilience technologies (FReT) on the individual property scale provides a previously untapped potential to reduce flood damage to buildings due to insufficient transparency of their effects. To overcome this obstacle, the paper presents a four-step extension of a synthetic approach for flood vulnerability analysis to provide evidence on the potential effects of FReT uptake concerning flood damage mitigation. The proposed approach has been integrated in the GIS-based flood damage simulation model HOWAD to support the assessment of FReT alternatives. The simulation of flood damage to buildings in the case study Heywood, Greater Manchester (United Kingdom) revealed the potential of the extended approach to determine the consequences of FReT implementation on building scale. flood resilience technologies; flood damage modelling; flood vulnerability assessment;DAMAGE ESTIMATION; VULNERABILITY","Mitigating the Risk of Extreme Water Scarcity and Dependency: The Case of Jordan Jordan faces great internal water scarcity and pollution, conflict over trans-boundary waters, and strong dependency on external water resources through trade. This paper analyzes these issues and subsequently reviews options to reduce the risk of extreme water scarcity and dependency. Based on estimates of water footprint, water availability, and virtual water trade, we find that groundwater consumption is nearly double the groundwater availability, water pollution aggravates blue water scarcity, and Jordan's external virtual water import dependency is 86%. The review of response options yields 10 ingredients for a strategy for Jordan to mitigate the risks of extreme water scarcity and dependency. With respect to these ingredients, Jordan's current water policy requires a strong redirection towards water demand management. Actual implementation of the plans in the national water strategy (against existing oppositions) would be a first step. However, more attention should be paid to reducing water demand by changing the consumption pattern of Jordanian consumers. Moreover, unsustainable exploitation of the fossil Disi aquifer should soon be halted and planned desalination projects require careful consideration regarding the sustainability of their energy supply. water scarcity; water pollution; water footprint; virtual water trade; water dependency; water risk; water security; sustainability; water policy;IRRIGATION WATER; VIRTUAL WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAFE YIELD; VALLEY; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; GROUNDWATER; STRATEGIES; FOOTPRINT","HER-2/neu Mediates Oncogenic Transformation via Altered CREB Expression and Function The cyclic (c) AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) plays a key role in many cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and signal transduction. Furthermore, CREB overexpression was found in tumors of distinct origin and evidence suggests an association with tumorigenicity. To establish a mechanistic link between HER-2/neu-mediated transformation and CREB protein expression and function, in vitro models of HER-2/neu-overexpressing and HER-2/neu-negative/silenced counterparts as well as human mammary carcinoma lesions with defined HER-2/neu status were used. HER-2/neu overexpression resulted in the induction and activation of CREB protein in vitro and in vivo, whereas short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated inhibition of HER-2/neu correlated with downregulated CREB activity. CREB activation in HER-2/neu-transformed cells enhanced distinct signal transduction pathways, whereas their inhibition negatively interfered with CREB expression and/or activation. CREB downregulation in HER-2/neu-transformed cells by shRNA and by the inhibitors KG-501 and lapatinib caused morphologic changes, reduced cell proliferation with G(0)-G(1) cell-cycle arrest, which was rescued by CREB expression. This was accompanied by reduced cell migration, wound healing, an increased fibronectin adherence, invasion, and matrixmetallo proteinase expression. In vivo shCREB-HER-2/neu(+) cells, but not control cells, exerted a significantly decreased tumorgenicity that was associated with decreased proliferative capacity, enhanced apoptosis, and increased frequency of Tlymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, CREB plays an important role in the HER-2/neu-mediated transformation by altering in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics. nan;ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; BREAST-CANCER; COLORECTAL-CANCER; DOWN-REGULATION; HUMAN-MELANOMA; TUMOR-GROWTH; CLASS-I; OVEREXPRESSION; THERAPY","A comprehensive analysis on definitions, development, and policies of nearly zero energy buildings in China With the rapid development of urbanization and the improvement of living standards of residents in China, the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the building sector is expected to increase in the near future. Nearly or net zero energy buildings have become a hot topic of research to reduce the fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. As the largest developing country and carbon emitter around the world, China has also made significant efforts on nearly zero energy buildings in recent decades. The central government has approved many demonstration projects on nearly zero energy buildings in different climate zones for more than ten years. This paper summarizes international definitions of zero-energy buildings, analyzes the latest definition and identifies the boundaries of nearly zero energy buildings in China. It provides an overview of the current situation, detailed policies and building codes of nearly zero energy buildings in China. Suggestions were given on the development and promotion of nearly zero energy buildings in China. These findings in this paper will help to guide the government to implement more efficient and effective policies and building codes of nearly zero-energy buildings in order to reduce carbon emissions in the building sector.

The minimum technical standards necessary for approaching ecological sustainability directly contravene the prospects for financial profitability. Therefore, industrial-scale SFM is likely to lead to the degradation and devaluation of primary tropical forests as surely as widespread conventional unmanaged logging does today Recent studies also show that logging in the tropics, even using SFM techniques, releases significant carbon dioxide and that carbon stocks once stored in logged timber and slash takes decades to rebuild. These results beg for a reevaluation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change proposals to apply a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation subsidy for the widespread implementation of SFM logging in tropical forests. However, encouraging models of the successful sustainable management of tropical forests for timber and nontimber products exist at local-community scales. sustainable forest management; high-value timber; primary tropical forest; logging; REDD;LONG-TERM IMPACTS; RAIN-FOREST; REDUCED-IMPACT; DEMOGRAPHIC-STRUCTURE; DIPTEROCARP FORESTS; MANAGED FORESTS; GROWTH-RATES; SEED; GAPS; BIODIVERSITY","Climate Change and Public Health Policy Climate change poses real and immediate impacts to the public health of populations around the globe.

Niching Penalized Chimp Optimization (NPChOA) is presented in this research in order to address the Environmental Economic Dispatch (EED) problem. In terms of global search capability, robustness, convergence rate, and durability, the proposed NPChOA outperforms the current ChOA. Following that, a novel constrained handling operator addresses the multi-objective optimization difficulty. The performance of NPChOA is evaluated using an IEEE 30 bus with six generators and a ten-unit system. The result of NPChOA is compared with Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Space Reduction Strategy Particle Swarm Optimization (SRSPSO), Chaotic Biogeography-Based Optimizer (CBBO), Dynamic Population Artificial Bee Colony (DPABC), Modified Bacterial Foraging Algorithm (MBFA), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Differential Evolution-Crossover Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (DE-CQPSO), standard ChOA, Dynamic Levy Flight ChOA (DLF-ChOA), and Weighted ChOA (WChOA) as the most recent modified version of ChOA to confirm its efficiency. NPChOA's evaluation score and convergence rate are outstanding compared to other benchmarks for single and multiobjective optimizations. The NPChOA's efficacy and robustness in dealing with environmental economic dispatch challenges have been demonstrated by discovering a good compromise value.

In this opinion paper, we propose a novel conceptual framework for understanding and assessing resilience in coupled socio-hydrological contexts, and encourage debate on the inter-connections between socio-hydrology and resilience. Taking a systems perspective, we argue that resilience is a set of systematic properties with three dimensions: absorptive, adaptive, and transformative, and contend that socio-hydrological systems can be viewed as various forms of human-water couplings, reflecting different aspects of these interactions. We propose a framework consisting of two parts. The first part addresses the identity of socio-hydrological resilience, answering questions such as ""resilience of what in relation to what"". We identify three existing framings of resilience for different types of human-water systems and subsystems, which have been used in different fields: (1) the water subsystem, highlighting hydrological resilience to anthropogenic hazards; (2) the human subsystem, foregrounding social resilience to hydrological hazards; and (3) the coupled human-water system, exhibiting socio-hydrological resilience. We argue that these three system types and resiliences afford new insights into the clarification and evaluation of different water management challenges. The first two types address hydrological and social states, while the third type emphasises the feedbacks and interactions between human and water compo-nents within complex systems subject to internal or external disturbances. In the second part, we focus on resilience management and develop the notion of the ""resilience canvas"", a novel heuristic device to identify possible pathways and to facilitate the design of bespoke strategies for enhancing resilience in the socio-hydrological context. The resilience canvas is constructed by combining absorptive and adaptive capacities as two axes. At the corners of the resulting two-dimensional space are four quadrants which we conceptualise as representing resilient, vulnerable, susceptible, and resistant system states. To address projected change-induced uncertainties, we recommend that efforts now be focused on shifting socio-hydrological systems from resistant towards resilient status. In sum, the novel framework proposed here clarifies the ambiguity inherent in socio-hydrological resilience, and provides a viable basis for further theoretical and practical development. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; WATER-RESOURCES; RIVER-BASIN; VULNERABILITY; SCIENCE; SYSTEMS; SUSTAINABILITY","The clean development mechanism's contribution to sustainable development: a review of the literature The challenges of how to respond to climate change and ensure sustainable development are currently high on the political agenda among the world's leading nations. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is part of the global carbon market developing rapidly as part of the Kyoto response towards the mitigation of global warming. One of the aims of the CDM is to achieve sustainable development in developing countries, but uncertainty prevails as to whether the CDM is doing what it promises to do. Close to 200 studies on the CDM have been carried out since its birth in 1997 including peer-reviewed articles and reports from the grey literature. This review of the literature serves to assess the state of knowledge on how the CDM contributes to sustainable development (SD) including poverty alleviation. The main finding of the review is that, left to market forces, the CDM does not significantly contribute to sustainable development. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION; CARBON MITIGATION; ADAPTATION","Revealing Biotic and Abiotic Controls of Harmful Algal Blooms in a Shallow Subtropical Lake through Statistical Machine Learning Harmful algal blooms are a growing human and environmental health hazard globally. Eco-physiological diversity of the cyanobacteria genera that make up these blooms creates challenges for water managers tasked with controlling the intensity and frequency of blooms, particularly of harmful taxa (e.g., toxin producers, N-2 fixers). Compounding these challenges is the ongoing debate over the efficacy of nutrient management strategies (phosphorus-only versus nitrogen and phosphorus), which increases decision-making uncertainty. To improve our understanding of how different cyanobacteria respond to nutrient levels and other biophysical factors, we analyzed a unique 17 year data set comprising monthly observations of cyanobacteria genera and zooplankton abundances, water quality, and flow in a bloom-impacted, subtropical, flow-through lake in Florida (United States). Using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm, an ensemble modeling approach, we characterized and quantified relationships among environmental conditions and five dominant cyanobacteria genera. Results highlighted nonlinear relationships and critical thresholds between cyanobacteria genera and environmental covariates, the potential for hydrology and temperature to limit the efficacy of cyanobacteria bloom management actions, and the importance of a dual nutrient management strategy for reducing bloom risk in the long term. nan;DUAL NUTRIENT N; FRESH-WATER; CYANOBACTERIUM MICROCYSTIS; CONTROLLING EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON SUCCESSION; BUOYANCY REGULATION; NITROGEN-FIXATION; GLOBAL EXPANSION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; P REDUCTIONS","Association of maternal ozone exposure with term low birth weight and susceptible window identification Background: Ozone pollution keeps deteriorating in the context of climate change. Maternal ozone exposure may be associated with low birth weight (LBW), but the results are still inconsistent. The identification of the critical exposure windows, a specific period of particular susceptibility during pregnancy, remains unresolved. We aimed to evaluate whether ozone exposure was associated with term LBW and further identify the susceptible exposure windows. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted in Guangzhou, a megacity in the most populous and economically developed city clusters in China. We included 444,096 singleton live births between January 2015 and July 2017. From 11 fixed stations, we collected daily 1-h maximum and 8-h maximum moving average ozone level (O-3-1 h and O-3-8 h) and calculated exposures for each participant based on their district of residence during pregnancy. We used traditional Logistic regression to estimate the trimester-specific association between ozone exposure and term LBW, and further estimated monthly- and weekly association by distributed lag models (DLMs) with Logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of term LBW were calculated for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone exposure. Stratified analyses and heterogeneity tests were conducted by maternal age and infant sex. Results: The incidence of term LBW was 1.9%. During the study period, the mean O-3-1 h and O-3-8 h levels were 112.6 mu g/m(3) and 84.5 mu g/m(3), respectively. Increased O-3-1 h (IQR: 90 mu g/m(3)) and O-3-8 h (73 mu g/m(3)) exposure during the second trimester were associated with increased risk of term LBW. At a monthly level, the term LBW risk was associated with O-3-1 h exposure during the 4th-6th month and O-3-8 h exposure during the 6th month. By estimating the weekly-specific association, we observed that critical exposure windows were the 15th-26th gestational weeks for O-3-1 h, and the 20th-26th weeks for O-3-8 h, respectively. Estimated ORs and 95% CIs ranged from 1.012 (1.000, 1.024) to 1.023 (1.007, 1.039). When examined by subgroups, the effects were present among women >= 35 years or < 25 years old and those with female babies. Conclusions: This study provides compelling evidence that exposure to O-3 was associated with increased risk of term LBW, and gestational weeks 15th-26th was found to be particularly susceptible. These findings provide a research basis for further mechanism examination, public health interventions, and targeted environmental policy-making.

In order to achieve this goal, first, the composition study was conducted in Sakarya, Turkey for one year. The results of first step are to be utilized as a reliable data source in establishing a complete picture of the environmental performances of municipal solid waste management systems with a life cycle perspective. The functional unit of the study was selected as one ton of municipal solid waste generated in Sakarya. System boundaries included collection and transportation of municipal solid waste and its treatment and disposal by MRF, incineration, composting and landfilling methods. Data on the process was gathered from a field study conducted in Sakarya, and from SimaPro 8.0.2 literature and libraries. The data was evaluated with CML-IA methodology by the means of abiotic depletion, abiotic depletion (fossil fuels), acidification, global warming, ozone depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidation. According to the results, while landfilling and incineration have been confirmed as the worst waste final disposal alternatives, composting and material recovery showed better performance. An integrated system (MRF, composting, incineration and landfilling) is considered as a solution towards improved sustainability to overcome the existing waste management problem. The paper showed LCA to be a valuable tool which can help governors and managers plan an integrated waste management strategy that provides more preferable environmental outcomes than the strategy suggested.

If the Social Security Administration determines a low-income individual has a disability, that person can move to another state and continue to receive benefits. But if that person moves to, say, Guam or the U.S. Virgin Islands, that person loses their right to federal aid. Similarly with SNAP (food stamps), federal spending rises with increased demand-whether because of a recession, a pandemic, or a climate disaster. But unlike the rest of the United States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa receive a limited amount of federal food assistance, regardless of need. That's why, after Hurricane Maria, despite additional congressional action, over a million Puerto Rican residents lost food assistance. And with Medicaid, federal law caps medical assistance for each of these five territories, a limit that does not exist for the fifty states or the District of Columbia. This Article draws much-needed attention to these discrepancies in legal status and social protection. It surveys the eligibility rules and financing structure of disability benefits, food assistance, and health insurance for low-income Americans in the states and the territories. A comprehensive account of these practices provokes questions about the tiers of citizenship built by a fragmented and devolved American state. Part I invokes the scholarship on social citizenship, the idea that an individual cannot meaningfully participate in society without some modicum of economic security. Part I then explores the tension between that normative commitment and one of the defining features of the American welfare state-federalism. It then elaborates the exceptional legal status of Americans who live in U.S. territories. Part II provides a comprehensive overview of federal food, medical, and disability assistance and, in doing so, demonstrates how the American territories inhabit a different and, in many ways, dilapidated corner of the American welfare state. Part III begins with an analysis of ongoing cases in federal court that challenge this facial discrimination. It then canvasses legislation introduced in Congress that would make significant progress in putting territorial Americans on par with Americans in the fifty states. To conclude, Part IV brings the states back in, using the earlier discussion of territories as an invitation to imagine an American welfare state built on a foundation other than a racial order. nan;SOCIAL CITIZENSHIP; UNITED-STATES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAFETY NET; LAW; RETHINKING; POVERTY; RIGHTS; DESERVINGNESS; VULNERABILITY","Adapting to climate change: perceptions of vulnerability of down-hill ski area operators in Southern and Middle Finland Climate change is likely to affect the tourism sector, particularly areas, such as snow-based tourism, that are directly dependent on climate and weather conditions. Especially vulnerable are low-lying ski areas. This study identifies the climatic factors that are crucial for economically successful operation of low-lying ski areas in Southern and Middle Finland and contemplates how these factors are seen to change with climate change. The study then analyses the preferences for and perceptions of adaptation strategies of downhill ski operators in terms of the adaptation measures they can implement or are willing to take. The findings indicate that climatic conditions set preconditions for the operation of the ski areas, but short-term operational prospects and inter-annual variability in weather conditions rather than foreseen changes in climatic conditions guide the operational decisions of the ski area operators. A key adaptation strategy to respond to uncertain snow conditions is artificial snowmaking, which lowers the vulnerability of the areas to the impacts of climate change too. climate; climate change adaptation; winter recreation; weather; skiing; tourism;ADAPTATION; TOURISM; INDUSTRY; RESORTS; SECTOR","Spatiotemporal climate variability and meteorological drought characterization in Ethiopia Increasing drought patterns with profound effects on livelihoods and food security have been documented in Ethiopia. From previous studies', assessments at various timescales, Ethiopia is regarded as a drought-prone country in East Africa. However, there is no documentation available. This paper investigates the spatiotemporal patterns of drought characteristics in 16 woredas (districts) as well as in the 14 homogeneous rainfall zones of homogeneous using monthly rainfall and temperature data over the period 1983 to 2020. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) were computed using time-series meteorological data to depict the spatial extent of drought characteristics and patterns at 4- and 12-month timescales. Within the period investigated, 12-month, 2015, and 2019 recorded the most extreme countrywide drought. The most prolonged drought duration lasted for 12 months in 2015. Although Ethiopia is a drought-prone country, the frequency, magnitude, and severity vary spatially by region. In planning for future actions, particular emphasis must be paid to the northeastern, eastern, northwestern, and southeastern parts of the country, which are more vulnerable. The findings could potentially influence and redirect national drought management and disaster preparedness programs for the affected areas.

There are many entry points for ""double duty"" actions that address climate adaptation and nutrition but they need to be implemented and scaled by governments.

However, for climate mitigation and adaption efforts, further studies are still needed to understand the regional consequences between the two global warming limits. Here we provide an assessment of changes in temperature extremes over China (relative to 1986-2005) at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming levels (relative to 1861-1900) by using the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models under three RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Results show that the increases in mean temperature and temperature extremes over China are greater than that in global mean temperature. With respect to 1986-2005, the temperature of hottest day (TXx) and coldest night (TNn) are projected to increase about 1/1.6 degrees C and 1.1/1.8 degrees C, whereas warm days (TX90p) and warm spell duration (WSDI) will increase about 7.5/13.8% and 15/30 d for the 1.5/2 degrees C global warming target, respectively. Under an additional 0.5 degrees C global warming, the projected increases of temperature in warmest day/night and coldest day/night are both more than 0.5 degrees C across almost the whole China. In Northwest China, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, the projected changes are particularly sensitive to the additional 0.5 degrees C global warming, for example, multi-model mean increase in coldest day (TXn) and coldest night (TNn) will be about 2 times higher than a change of 0.5 degrees C global warming. Although the area-averaged changes in temperature extremes are very similar for different scenarios, spatial hotspot still exists, such as in Northwest China and North China, the increases in temperatures are apparently larger in RCP8.5 than that in RCP4.5. 1.5 degrees C global warming; 2 degrees C global warming; Temperature extremes; CMIP5; China;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCENARIO","Population genetic structure of Iris ensata on sky-islands and its implications for assisted migration Due to global warming since the Last Glacial Maximum, many plant populations have retreated to mountain tops, i.e., sky-islands, which are isolated by low-elevation barriers and inhospitable habitats. Under projected environmental changes, these populations may decline and face local extinction. Iris ensata Thunb. populations at the species' most southern distribution range are in this position. We used eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers and three fragments of chloroplast genome to analyze population structure of six extant sky-island populations of I. ensata. A total of 83 alleles were found across 192 individuals from six populations. High levels of intra-population genetic diversity (H (E) = 0.578, H (O) = 0.608) of I. ensata were detected. Moderate but significant levels of genetic differentiation were also found among the populations (F (ST) = 0.133, P < 0.001). Mantel test showed no isolation-by-distance pattern (r = 0.339, P = 0.161). Assignment analysis classified all individuals into five groups, and four populations were dominated by only one group. Five chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) haplotypes were found, and one was shared by all populations. Two populations contained a private haplotype. Long-term fragmentation, but relatively large population sizes and restricted gene flow among populations, contributed to the above patterns. Under projected habitat changes, the studied populations are at risk of local extinction. We identified three populations that had a high priority of ex situ conservation to be the source populations for the future assisted migration. Number of individuals, how to select individuals, and a potential recipient site were discussed.

Since methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, the abatement of the emission is necessary to achieve a more sustainable urban water management. This requires thorough knowledge of the amount of methane that is emitted from a plant, but also of the possible sources and sinks of methane on the plant. In this study, the methane emission from a full-scale municipal wastewater facility with sludge digestion was evaluated during one year. At this plant the contribution of methane emissions to the greenhouse gas footprint were slightly higher than the CO2 emissions related to direct and indirect fossil fuel consumption for energy requirements. By setting up mass balances over the different unit processes, it could be established that three quarters of the total methane emission originated from the anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sludge. This amount exceeded the carbon dioxide emission that was avoided by utilizing the biogas. About 80% of the methane entering the activated sludge reactor was biologically oxidized. This knowledge led to the identification of possible measures for the abatement of the methane emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nineteen environmental and socio-economic indicators are identified to reflect the three components of vulnerability: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. The results of the study show that the regions most exposed to climate change and variability do not always overlap with those experiencing high sensitivity or low adaptive capacity. Furthermore, vulnerability to climate change and variability is intrinsically linked with social and economic development. The Western Cape and Gauteng provinces, which have high levels of infrastructure development, high literacy rates, and low shares of agriculture in total GDP, are relatively low on the vulnerability index. In contrast, the highly vulnerable regions of Limpopo, Kwazulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape are characterised by densely populated rural areas, large numbers of small-scale farmers, high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and high land degradation. These large differences in the extent of vulnerability among provinces suggest that policymakers should develop region-specific policies and address climate change at the local level.

Even though phenotypic characterization is an inexpensive approach for elucidating variation hidden in genetic resources, information on the genetic diversity patterns in large collections of landraces remains limited and this constitutes a major impediment for their optimal utilization in modern maize breeding programs. We investigated the extent of phenotypic diversity among 196 maize landraces, representing gene pools from Burkina Faso, Ghana and Togo, and 14 improved populations/varieties from the Maize Improvement Program of International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA-MIP). The germplasm was assessed for 26 agronomic traits. Highly significant differences (P ) were observed among the accessions for all measured traits. Cluster analysis separated the maize germplasm into five major groups, differentiated largely by phenology and overall phenotypic appeal, enabling identification of outstanding genotypes for further screening for stress tolerance. Wide genetic diversity was observed between Burkinabe and improved gene pools, suggesting that the original Sahelian gene pool might not have contributed much to modern cultivars. This gene pool offers opportunities for pre-breeding by providing novel alleles for enriching elite maize germplasm. Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H?) revealed high genetic variability among the landraces (H??=?0.73) and a narrow genetic base in the improved populations and varieties (H??=?0.46). These results provide new insights into the potential of tropical maize landraces for genetic improvement of maize.

Historical sea level records indicate that relative sea level (RSL) has been increasing along the Danish North Sea coast, south of Skagerrak, following the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. In the central Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas, RSL rise has been practically absent, due to the GMSL rise being off-set by the Fennoscandian post-glacial land-uplift. The new IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) reported that under RCP8.5 GMSL will increase more than the previous estimates in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) at the end of twenty-first century due to Antarctic ice sheet dynamics. We performed a regionalization of the SROCC sea level projections for the ""Danish Climate Atlas"" dataset, a nation-wide climate adaptation dataset based on IPCC and various national and international databases. In these complementary datasets, important local data have been considered, which have not been included in the IPCC SROCC GMSL rise estimates, i.e., more precise national-wide land-rise prediction and sets of sea level fingerprints. Our results indicate that sea level projections under RCP8.5 results in a > 40 cm RSL rise at the end of the twenty-first century in the Skagerrak Kattegat Seas, which might call for a new adaptation strategy in this region. The rate of mean sea level rise will exceed the rate of the land-rise earlier than the previous estimates by AR5 under the RCP8.5 scenario. In particular, we stress how these new estimates will affect future extreme sea levels in this region. Based on our results, we suggest this more recent GMSL projection needs to be considered in coastal risk assessments in the Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas also in this century. sea level rise; IPCC SROCC; North Sea; Baltic Sea; Denmark; storm surge;GLACIAL ISOSTATIC-ADJUSTMENT; PROBABILISTIC REANALYSIS; BALTIC SEA; RISE; ANTARCTICA; SCENARIOS; FRAMEWORK; MODEL","Assessment of seawater intrusion potential from sea-level rise and groundwater extraction in a coastal aquifer Groundwater is an important water resource in many coastal areas around the world. Excessive pumping can change the flow pattern so that seawater may migrate into the freshwater aquifer. In addition, the rise of the sea level due to climate change could accelerate the landward intrusion of seawater. This study addresses the problem of variable-density groundwater flow and miscible salt transport to assess the potential of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. Our conceptual model considers a complete hydrogeologic system including the river system, the seasonal groundwater recharge, the groundwater pumping, and the interaction between seawater and groundwater. Model calibration is performed using the covariance matrix adaptation-evolution strategy as a robust derivative-free global optimization algorithm. The advantage of this algorithm is its ability to reach a near global solution in solving the groundwater inverse problem, which is typically nonlinear and ill-posed. Simulations for the Nam Dinh Province, Vietnam over the period of 90years indicate that seawater intrusion will occur, but the extent of it will vary depending on scenarios. The extraction of groundwater is the key factor governing the intrusion of seawater. The magnitude of seawater intrusion caused by rising sea level sturned out to be relatively small. Sensitivity analysis reveals that uncertainties of transport parameters could significantly affect the assessment of seawater intrusion potential.

To address this issue, we investigated thermal relations of three sympatric lizard species (Eremias argus, Eremias multiocellata, and Phrynocephalus przewalskii) in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. We determined the thermoregulatory behavior, body temperature (T (b)), operative temperature (T (e)), selected body temperature (T (sel)), and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of adult lizards. Based on these physiological parameters, we quantified the accuracy and effectiveness of thermoregulation as well as thermal-safety margin for these species. The three species were accurate and effective thermoregulators. The P. przewalskii preferred open habitats, and had a higher T (b) than the two Eremias lizards, which preferred shade habitats and shuttled more frequently between the shade and sun. This indicated that the three sympatric lizards have different thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology, which might facilitate their coexistence in the desert steppe ecosystem. In addition, the P. przewalskii had higher T (sel) and CTmax, and a wider thermal-safety margin than the two Eremias lizards, suggesting that the two Eremias lizards would be more vulnerable to climate warming than P. przewalskii.

Saplings were grown under mountainous conditions for two growing seasons at ambient (400 mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) and elevated (700 mu mol CO2 mol(-1)) CO2 concentration. Half were not exposed to precipitation during the summer (June-August). After two seasons of cultivation under modified conditions, basic photosynthetic characteristics including light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (A(max)), stomatal conductance (G(Smax)), and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured under their growth CO2 concentrations together with in vivo carboxylation rate (V-C) and electron transport rate (J) derived from CO2-response curves at saturating light. An increase in A(max) under elevated CO2 was observed in oak saplings, whereas it remained unchanged or slightly declined in Norway spruce, indicating a down-regulation of photosynthesis. Such acclimation was associated with an acclimation of both J and V-C. Both species had increased WUE under elevated CO2 although, in well-watered oaks, WUE remained unchanged. Significant interactive effects of tree species, CO2 concentration, and water availability on gas-exchange parameters (A(max), G(Smax), WUE) were observed, while there was no effect on biochemical (V-C, J) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. The assimilation capacity (A(sat); CO2 assimilation rate at saturating light intensity and CO2 concentration) was substantially reduced in spruce under the combined conditions of water deficiency and elevated CO2, but not in oak. In addition, the stimulatory effect of elevated CO2 on A(max) persisted in oak, but completely diminished in water-limited spruce saplings. Our results suggest a strong species-specific response of trees to reduced summer precipitation under future conditions of elevated CO2 and a limited compensatory effect of elevated CO2 on CO2 uptake under water-limited conditions in coniferous spruce. chlorophyll fluorescence; climate change; electron transport rate; elevated carbon dioxide; photosynthetic acclimation; tree physiology; Rubisco carboxylation rate; water availability;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; DOWN-REGULATION; GAS-EXCHANGE; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; TEMPERATURE RESPONSE; GROWTH; CARBON; DROUGHT; C-3","Variability and time series trend analysis of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia: A case study in Woleka sub-basin Examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, trend analysis has been employed to inspect the change of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia using gridded monthly precipitation data obtained from Global Precipitation and Climate Centre (GPCC V7) and temperature data from Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 3.23) with 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees resolution from 1901 to 2014. Data have been analyzed using coefficient of variation, anomaly index, precipitation concentration index and Palmer drought severity index. Furthermore, Mann-Kendall test was used to detect the time series trend. The result revealed intra-and inter-annual variability of rainfall while Palmer drought severity index value proved the increasing trend of the number of drought years. Annual, belg and kiremt rainfall have decreased with a rate of 15.03, 1.93 and 13.12mm per decade respectively. The declining trend for annual and kiremt rainfall was found to be statistically significant while that of belg was not significant. The rate of change of temperature was found to be 0.046, 0.067 and 0.026 degrees C per decade for mean, minimum and maximum respectively. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis test result revealed increasing trend for mean and minimum average temperatures through time significantly while the trend for maximum temperature exhibited a non-significant increasing trend. We recommend strategies designed in the agricultural sector have to take the declining and erratic nature of rainfall and increasing trend of temperature into consideration.

As the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Technology Mechanism, the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) has strong convening power amongst the stakeholders who are responsible for climate actions in their country. Our research identified that the CTCN has successfully provided ""4 openness"" models (open network, open request for Technical Assistance, open technology transfer and finance, and open knowledge for the public) to global partners through its technical assistance (TA) services. Then, on the basis of previous empirical Technical Assistance data and network management a new open innovation model was proposed by considering the CTCN matchmaking activities with key stakeholders (innovation networks) during the climate technology transfer processes. This model explains that the role of the CTCN and innovation networks such as academia/research institutions, governments, and the private sector can be interpreted as outside-in innovation at the first technology outsourcing stage, coupled innovation at the second technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) stage, and inside-out innovation at the third technology diffusion stage. Moreover, further matchmaker's approaches for supporting developing countries to establish a conducive and sustainable innovation system were suggested for the extension of our new model. climate technology; open innovation; technical assistance; matchmaker; innovation system;INTERMEDIARIES; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEMS","Additionality When REDD Contracts Must be Self-Enforcing This paper examines self-enforcing contracts as a financial mechanism for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation when the opportunity cost of the land (i.e., landholder type) is private information and is imperfectly correlated over time (i.e., partially persistent types). Because self-enforcement limits the feasible incentives, the conservation levels are constrained by the surplus created. Regardless of the degree of persistence of such opportunity costs across contracting periods, a first-best self-enforcing contract can deliver ""additional"" carbon sequestration beyond the business as usual scenario only if the value of forest conservation is sufficiently high. Otherwise, self-enforcing contracts can induce some, suboptimal level of carbon sequestration. The degree of persistence of opportunity costs across periods does not affect the amount of total payments provided in the optimal menu of contracts, but greater persistence of opportunity cost types leads to contracts that feature more of the total payment as a bonus in contracts for landholders with a high opportunity cost for their land and more of the total payment as an upfront fixed payment for landholders with a low opportunity cost. ","Farmers' perceptions and adaptation strategies to climate change in Punjab agriculture Climate change is affecting the performance of agriculture. Farmers are the hardest hit as they have to continuously respond to climate variations. In order to know the farmers' perceptions about climate change and the adaptation strategies the present study collected the primary data from 200 farmers from different agro-climatic zones of Punjab. Multinomial logit model was used to identify the factors affecting the adaptation of climate resilient technologies. The findings revealed that most of the farmers (77%) perceived decrease in seasonal rainfall while 53% of them perceived decrease in rainfall in rabi season. Majority of the farmers (83.5% in kharif and 93% in rabi) perceived that temperature is higher than before. The adaptation choices mostly practiced by sample farmers were laser levelling of the field and improvement in irrigation structures, which was adopted by 30 and 27% of total adoption respectively. The regression model discerned determinants affecting adaptation choices were, viz. age, education, farm size, perception on temperature and extension lectures. Adaptation to climate change is constrained by several factors such as lack of knowledge about technology, lack of finance and credit availability and inadequate trainings and demonstrations about the climate resilient technologies.

Using recently developed indicators of climatic macrorefugia, environmental diversity, and corridors, we conducted a systematic, climate-informed prioritization of conservation values across North America. We explicitly considered complementarity of multiple conservation objectives, capturing key niche-based temperature and moisture thresholds for 324 tree species and 268 songbird species. Conservation rankings were influenced most strongly by climate corridors and species-specific refugia layers. Although areas of high conservation value under climate change were partially aligned with existing protected areas, similar to 80% of areas within the top quintile of biome-level conservation values lack formal protection. Results from this study and application of our approach elsewhere can help improve the long-term value of conservation investments at multiple spatial scales. climate corridors; climate-change adaptation; conservation planning; protected areas; refugia; Zonation;BIODIVERSITY; VELOCITY","Recent methods of drought stress tolerance in plants In the climate change scenario the drought has been diagnosed as major stress affecting crop productivity. This review demonstrates some recent findings on the amelioration of drought stress. Nanoparticles, synthetic growth regulators viz. Trinexapac-ethyl, and Biochar addition helps to economize the water budget of plants, enhances the bioavailability of water and nutrients as well as overcomes drought induced osmotic and oxidative stresses. Besides ABA, SA and JA are also involved in inducing tolerance to drought stress through modulation of physiological and biochemical processes in plants. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) offer new opportunities in agricultural biotechnology. These beneficial microorganisms colonize the rhizosphere/endo-rhizosphere of plants and impart drought tolerance by improving root architechture, enhancing water use efficiency, producing exopolysaccharides, phytohormones viz, ABA, SA and IAA and volatile compounds. Further PGPR also play positive role in combating osmotic and oxidative stresses induced by drought stress through enhancing the accumulation of osmolytes, antioxidants and upregulation or down regulation of stress responsive genes. In transgenic plants stress inducible genes enhanced abiotic stress tolerance by encoding key enzymes regulating biosynthesis of compatible solutes. The role of genes/cDNAs encoding proteins involved in regulating other genes/proteins, signal transduction process and strategies to improve drought stress tolerance have also been discussed.

Understanding the determinants of adaptive capacity is, therefore, crucial for effective responses to climate change. This paper offers an assessment of adaptive capacity across a range of sectors in South East Queensland, Australia. The paper has four parts, including (1) an overview of adaptive capacity, in particular as a learning process; (2) a description of the various methods used to determine adaptive capacity; (3) a synthesis of the determinants of adaptive capacity; and (4) the identification of mechanisms to build adaptive capacity in the region. We conclude that the major issue impacting adaptive capacity is not the availability of physical resources but the dominant social, political and institutional culture of the region.

In particular, grazing may alter the ecosystem services provided by soil, such as carbon and organic matter accumulation, carbon storage, and water infiltration. The present study evaluated the relative contents of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil organic carbon (SOC) on soil in a human induced grassland and an frequently grazed Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forest in Nevado de Toluca, Mexico. It assessed carbon stocks in 2 different soil layers (0-5 cm and 5-25 cm), as well as soil compaction and water infiltration in both land uses. Results showed slightly lower SOM (21.7%) and SOC (12.6%) in soils on which livestock were grazed than in forest soils (25.7% for SOM and 14.65%, for SOC) at both depths and a greater bulk density of livestock soils (0.86 g cm(-3)) than of forest soils (0.73 g cm(-3)), particularly in the 0-5 cm(-3) layer (0.88 g cm(-3)) of livestock soils. More than 40 years of livestock grazing has clearly impacted the capacity of soils to accumulate organic matter and organic carbon. However, carbon stocks and water infiltration were not significantly affected, as low carbon accumulation was compensated by changes in soil bulk density. These results indicate that extensive livestock ranching and resource conservation are not necessarily mutually exclusive in the study site. Direct and indirect mechanisms involved in the provision of the evaluated regulating services should be further studied, taking into account the highly variable social and environmental conditions of Nevado de Toluca. Management policies should also aim to maintain an equilibrium between livestock rancher needs and conservation of supporting and regulating ecosystem services that are highly relevant to the functioning of mountain ecosystems.

This has encouraged governments worldwide to fund the development of ultra-low carbon emission vehicles and replace internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs). Among EV drivers, 'range anxiety' is one of the main issues resulting from long charging durations. The reduction of charging duration by the introduction of DC fast/rapid charging stations is widely discussed in the literature. However, high charging demands due to fast charging stations may cause some challenges for power networks. In this paper, the impacts of different types of fast chargers on a UK generic distribution network are investigated. The most suitable and robust connection points of the network where fast chargers can be deployed are identified without affecting the stability and security of the system. The main findings show that network losses increase, voltages operate beyond strict limits, and system equipment becomes overloaded with increased fast charging activities in the network. Therefore, critical network points are reinforced with distributed generation units (DG) and static VAr compensator (SVC) devices to improve the system reliability and mitigate the impacts of such challenges.

Children are among the most vulnerable groups when disasters occur, yet their voices in disaster risk reduction are rarely heard. Using a qualitative methodology, this article examines the extent to which children are involved in disaster risk reduction in Muzarabani District, Zimbabwe. Despite evidence of the potential positive impact that children can have on DRR, their involvement in risk reduction planning in Zimbabwe is negligible. To achieve greater resilience to disasters requires that children's voices are heard and recognized as central to improved disaster risk reduction.

We assume a retreating ice sheet margin and prescribe meltwater and sediment supply to a channelized subglacial drainage system. The hydrodynamic model for the subglacial channel has its cross section governed by wall melting, creep closure, and sediment deposition. Sediment-carrying capacity typically increases downstream, before decreasing rapidly near the margin, suggesting that most deposition occurs there. This can lead to choking near the margin, which is offset by enhanced melting to keep the channel open. The model shows that the deposition rate varies roughly quadratically with sediment supply and inversely with water flux. For given sediment supply, the model suggests esker formation is most prevalent in smaller channels. Larger ice sheet melt rates likely produce more closely spaced eskers, but with smaller cross sections. esker; subglacial landforms; mathematical model; deglaciation;SUBGLACIAL DRAINAGE; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; ICE; LAURENTIDE; EROSION; DEGLACIATION; BENEATH","The Expanding Footprint of Rapid Arctic Change Arctic land ice is melting, sea ice is decreasing, and permafrost is thawing. Changes in these Arctic elements are interconnected, and most interactions accelerate the rate of change. The changes affect infrastructure, economics, and cultures of people inside and outside of the Arctic, including in temperate and tropical regions, through sea level rise, worsening storm and hurricane impacts, and enhanced warming. Coastal communities worldwide are already experiencing more regular flooding, drinking water contamination, and coastal erosion. We describe and summarize the nature of change for Arctic permafrost, land ice, and sea ice, and its influences on lower latitudes, particularly the United States. We emphasize that impacts will worsen in the future unless individuals, businesses, communities, and policy makers proactively engage in mitigation and adaptation activities to reduce the effects of Arctic changes and safeguard people and society.

During dust storms, daily averages of atmospheric PM concentrations can reach high levels above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for air quality. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of forests on PM distribution following dust events in a region that is subjected to frequent dust storms (Northern Negev, Israel). Dust was measured in a forest transect including urban environments that are nearby the forest and at a distal location. During a background period, without dust events, the forest with its surrounding areas were characterized by lower monthly average of PM concentrations (38 mu g/m(3)) compared with areas that are not affected by the forest (54 mu g/m(3)). Such difference can be meaningful for long-term human health exposure. A reduction in PM levels in the forest transect was evident at most measured dust events, depending on the storm intensity and the locations of the protected areas. A significant reduction in PM2.5/PM10 during dust events, indicates the high efficiency of the forest trees to absorb airborne PM2.5. Analysis of dust particles absorbed on the foliage revealed a total dust deposits of 8.1-92 g/m(2), which is equal to a minimum of 4182 tons removed from the atmosphere per a forest foliage area (30 km(2)). The findings can support environmental strategies to enhance life quality in regions that are subjected to dust storms, or under potential risk of dust-related PM due to land use and/or climate changes.

However, it remains unclear how different governance processes can coordinate competing resource uses despite incoherence of institutional resource regimes. This paper examines how institutional resource regimes and polycentric governance processes are co-evolving and to what extent these processes coordinate competing resource uses in incoherent resource regimes. Empirically, we performed an embedded case study of the institutional resource regime and governance processes of three water reservoir projects with contrasting outcomes in the region of Oberhasli in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, covering a timeframe starting from the early 20th century. Data were collected through 21 semi-structured interviews, document analysis, participatory observation, and transect walks. Analytically, we demonstrate how the combination of the Institutional Resource Regime and polycentric governance frameworks provides an opportunity to analyze co-evolving resource regimes and governance processes. The results show that the institutional resource regime has become increasingly incoherent over the past decades, but the evolution of polycentric processes to govern competing water uses compensated for regime incoherence. Polycentric governance improved the coordination of water uses, if mutual adjustment, trust and activation of overarching rules between actors with similar and opposing interests were present. We conclude that institutional regime incoherence may constitute a critical barrier to climate change adaptation, but polycentric governance processes may alleviate critical challenges arising from regime incoherence.

However, this approach ignores cross-border climate change impacts that occur remotely from the location of their initial impact and that may severely disrupt societies and livelihoods. We propose a conceptual framework and accompanying nomenclature for describing and analysing such cross-border impacts. The conceptual framework distinguishes an initial impact that is caused by a climate trigger within a specific region. Downstream consequences of that impact propagate through an impact transmission system while adaptation responses to deal with the impact propagate through a response transmission system. A key to understanding cross-border impacts and responses is a recognition of different types of climate triggers, categories of cross-border impacts, the scales and dynamics of impact transmission, the targets and dynamics of responses and the socio-economic and environmental context that also encompasses factors and processes unrelated to climate change. These insights can then provide a basis for identifying relevant causal relationships. We apply the framework to the floods that affected industrial production in Thailand in 2011, and to projected Arctic sea ice decline, and demonstrate that the framework can usefully capture the complex system dynamics of cross-border climate impacts. It also provides a useful mechanism to identify and understand adaptation strategies and their potential consequences in the wider context of resilience planning. The cross border dimensions of climate impacts could become increasingly important as climate changes intensify. We conclude that our framework will allow for these to be properly accounted for, help to identify new areas of empirical and model-based research and thereby support climate risk management.

LULC plays an important role in the ecological and environmental protection of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), which is a unique geographical location. The LULC of the QTP has undergone drastic changes during the past few decades due to local planning and policy implementation. Projects such as reforestation and grassland restoration are exerting pressure on land resources and may affect future land use patterns considerably. Current assessments of future land use changes rarely focus on the multiple demands for commodities and services. This study employed the CLUMondo model to predict future land use change trajectories for the period 2010-2030 under three different scenarios. The results indicate that land system changes varied notably under different land management strategies and exhibited large locational discrepancies. Moreover, future land system changes are mainly demonstrated in the form of management intensification under all three scenarios. High demand for livestock in the TREND scenario leads to grassland expansion as well, resulting in corresponding increase in the grassland cover density. Additionally, the expansion of forest area under the FOREST scenario suggests that caution should be exercised during afforestation in the QTP. The results of this study can guide and support future land-use planning, management, and policy formulation in the QTP.

Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call. biophilic cities.. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing. biophilic cities; sustainable cities; resilient cities;NATURAL-ENVIRONMENT; SOCIAL SUPPORT; NEARBY NATURE; HEALTH","Corporate climate risk and stock market reaction to performance briefings in China This study aims to enrich our understanding of the valuation consequence of climate risk in financial markets. The primary focus of our study is on the stock price reaction to firms' climate-risk-related information. We employ transcripts of Chinese listed firms' performance briefings to capture the climate risk at the firm level. Using a sample of Chinese listed firms between 2009 and 2021, we find that greater corporate climate risks lead to negative market reactions over a short time window, consistent with the market quickly comprehending corporate climate risks. This result holds for a series of robustness checks. We further find that the negative impact of corporate climate risk on the stock price reaction operates through the increased market trading activities, greater investor attention, and reduced positive media coverage. Finally, we demonstrate that industry carbon emission, local abnormal temperature, state ownership, institutional shareholding, and dividend payout are important moderators that shape the association of the corporate climate risk and the adverse market reaction. Our evidence suggests that disclosures of climate-related information can help the stock market to price climate risk more efficiently.

Despite having been discovered in Uganda for almost 60 years, <20 human cases were reported before 2007. The massive epidemics in the Pacific islands associated with the ZIKV Asian lineage in 2007 and 2013 were followed by explosive outbreaks in Latin America in 2015. Although increased mosquito breeding associated with the El Nino effect superimposed on global warming is suspected, genetic changes in its RNA virus genome may have led to better adaptation to mosquitoes, other animal reservoirs, and human. We reviewed the epidemiology, clinical manifestation, virology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, management, and prevention of this emerging infection. Laboratory diagnosis can be confounded by cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. Besides mosquito bite and transplacental transmission, the risk of other potential routes of transmission by transfusion, transplantation, sexual activity, breastfeeding, respiratory droplet, and animal bite is discussed. Epidemic control requires adequate clearance of mosquito breeding grounds, personal protection against mosquito bite, and hopefully a safe and effective vaccine.

Use and Role of Local and External Knowledge in Agroforestry Projects in Bolivia Agroforestry often relies on local knowledge, which is gaining recognition in development projects. However, how local knowledge can articulate with external and scientific knowledge is little known. Our study explored the use and integration of local and external knowledge in agroforestry projects in Bolivia. In 42 field visits and 62 interviews with agroforestry farmers, civil society representatives, and policymakers, we found a diverse knowledge base. We examined how local and external knowledge contribute to livelihood assets and tree and crop diversity. Projects based predominantly on external knowledge tended to promote a single combination of tree and crop species and targeted mainly financial capital, whereas projects with a local or mixed knowledge base tended to focus on food security and increased natural capital (e.g., soil restoration) and used a higher diversity of trees and crops than those with an external knowledge base. The integration of different forms of knowledge can enable farmers to better cope with new challenges emerging as a result of climate change, fluctuating market prices for cash crops, and surrounding destructive land use strategies such as uncontrolled fires and aerial fumigation with herbicides. However, many projects still tended to prioritize external knowledge and undervalue local knowledge-a tendency that has long been institutionalized in the formal educational system and in extension services. More dialogue is needed between different forms of knowledge, which can be promoted by strengthening local organizations and their networks, reforming agricultural educational institutions, and working in close interaction with policymakers.

Yet little is known about the capability of Antarctic notothenioid fish to cope with rising temperature in acidifying seawater. While the whole animal level is expected to be more sensitive towards hypercapnia and temperature, the basis of thermal tolerance is set at the cellular level, with a putative key role for mitochondria. This study therefore investigates the physiological responses of the Antarctic Notothenia rossii after long-term acclimation to increased temperatures (7 degrees C) and elevated PCO2 (0.2 kPa CO2) at different levels of physiological organisation. Results: For an integrated picture, we analysed the acclimation capacities of N. rossii by measuring routine metabolic rate (RMR), mitochondrial capacities (state III respiration) as well as intra- and extracellular acid-base status during acute thermal challenges and after long-term acclimation to changing temperature and hypercapnia. RMR was partially compensated during warm-acclimation (decreased below the rate observed after acute warming), while elevated PCO2 had no effect on cold or warm acclimated RMR. Mitochondrial state III respiration was unaffected by temperature acclimation but depressed in cold and warm hypercapnia-acclimated fish. In both cold- and warm-exposed N. rossii, hypercapnia acclimation resulted in a shift of extracellular pH (pH(e)) towards more alkaline values. A similar overcompensation was visible in muscle intracellular pH (pH(i)). pH(i) in liver displayed a slight acidosis after warm normo- or hypercapnia acclimation, nevertheless, long-term exposure to higher PCO2 was compensated for by intracellular bicarbonate accumulation. Conclusion: The partial warm compensation in whole animal metabolic rate indicates beginning limitations in tissue oxygen supply after warm-acclimation of N. rossii. Compensatory mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial capacities under chronic hypercapnia may include a new metabolic equilibrium to meet the elevated energy demand for acid-base regulation. New set points of acid-base regulation under hypercapnia, visible at the systemic and intracellular level, indicate that N. rossii can at least in part acclimate to ocean warming and acidification. It remains open whether the reduced capacities of mitochondrial energy metabolism are adaptive or would impair population fitness over longer timescales under chronically elevated temperature and PCO2.

Shaded coffee in agroforestry systems appear to be a good alternative to protect coffee from extreme temperatures while providing additional ecosystem services, such as extra food and soil protection. However, excessive shade might reduce coffee yields. This study analyzed the effect of shade cover (shade type represented by cropping system (Coffee-Open (CO), Coffee-Banana (CB), Coffee-shade tree (CT))), and shade intensity (represented by leaf area index of the shade cover) along an altitude gradient on: (i) microclimate, (ii) soil water content and (iii) coffee reproductive and vegetative growth. Data was collected during two coffee fruit development cycles (2015 and 2016) in smallholder coffee farms (n = 27) on the west slopes of Mt. Elgon Uganda. Shade cover buffered coffee trees from microclimate extremes (maximum temperature (-3 C) and temperature amplitude -3 & nbsp;C). Fruit set decreased with shade cover increases. Leaf set was shown to be the most important variable for vegetative and reproductive growth along several production cycles, and fruit drop was determined mainly by fruit set. Intermediated shade cover (LAI ~ 1 m(2) m(-2)), as occurred in coffee intercropped with bananas, showed an optimal balance between microclimate regulations, fruit set, and fruit drop, and provided staple food and an extra source of income.

As a result, riparian ecosystems can be described as mobile habitat mosaics characterized by variability and unpredictability. Any river restoration initiative should aim to mimic these attributes. This paper suggests that there needs to be an increased institutional capacity to accept some levels of both variability and unpredictability in the ecological outcomes of river restoration projects. Restoration projects have frequently used some form of historical or contemporary reference system to define objectives and to help in the evaluation process. Using these reference systems can give a false sense of the predictability of ecological outcomes. We suggest that reference systems need to be used with caution for six reasons: (1) there are often no appropriate reference systems to use, (2) many catchment parameters have changed since the times of chosen historic reference systems, (3) climate change has been continuous throughout the Holocene, (4) projected climate change is of uncertain magnitude, (5) alien species cannot be avoided, and (6) landscape context changes through time. As well as defining short-term objectives, we suggest that river restoration projects should also formulate longer-term (decadel) restoration trajectories that are less predictable but more representative of real system attributes. Restoration trajectories could be defined using a range of ecological outcomes to accommodate interannual variability. The challenges of defining what levels of variability are important for restoring European floodplain forests are used to demonstrate the difficulties of broadening approaches and creating trajectories. In particular, the changing significance of variability at different spatial and temporal scales is discussed. An account is given of a restoration project at Wicken Fen in the United Kingdom in which nondeterministic approaches to goal setting have been initiated. river restoration; predictability; variability; restoration trajectories; reference systems; Wicken Fen; floodplain forests; restoration objectives; restoration evaluation;RIVER; VEGETATION; DIVERSITY; PREDICTABILITY; REGENERATION; COMMUNITIES; FLOODPLAINS; DYNAMICS; FOREST; TIME","Evaluating the Impact of Climate Change on Water Quality and Quantity in an Urban Watershed Using an Ensemble Approach Considerable efforts are underway to restore watersheds and estuaries downstream impacted by urban development; however, climate change (CC) may be undermining them. Current methods are limited in their ability to predict hydrology and water quality with CC and assess its effect on the efficiency of stormwater control measures (SCMs). We developed a method using downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to project precipitation and temperatures; these were used to force a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Three scenarios, a historical and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with five GCMs, were used to produce ensemble results. All GCMs in both RCP scenarios projected increases in precipitation and temperature compared to historical conditions. Both RCPs exhibited their largest increases in precipitation, streamflow, total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loads in the winter, summer exhibited the largest increase in temperature. Median loads of TSS, TN, and TP increased 3.1%, 2.5%, and 9.9%, respectively, for RCP 4.5, and increased 3.8%, 3.1%, and 10.4%, respectively, for RCP 8.5. Median reductions in TSS, TN, and TP SCM efficiency for RCP 4.5 were projected to be 6%, 7%, and 11%, respectively; and 11%, 12%, and 17% for RCP 8.5, respectively. Thus, it is likely that additional efforts will be needed to meet water quality goals in the future. Methods such as these can help create climate resilient watershed improvement strategies and guide urban stormwater planning against likely future changes as a result of CC.

Deficit irrigation uses limited water resources to achieve stable crop yield according to the migration law of production parameters during crop growth. This study uses meta-analysis to quantitatively analyze the yield and water effects on winter wheat and summer maize under deficit irrigation in northern China based on previously published studies. The result shows that deficit irrigation results in an average yield reduction of 7.10% for wheat and an average yield reduction of 18.71% for maize, while the average water use efficiency (WUE) increases by 9.25% and 6.38% for wheat and maize, respectively. This research reveals the differences and effectiveness of deficit irrigation of wheat and maize in different regions and hydrological years and proposes appropriate water deficit levels and irrigation strategies. The optimal deficit irrigation schedule in different regions involves irrigating twice during the wheat growth with irrigation quotas of 100-200 mm. Generally, supplementary irrigation is carried out during the critical water demand period. When supplemental water (the sum of irrigation and precipitation) is 80% of full irrigation (FI), maize can obtain higher yield and WUE. This study provides a reference for irrigation strategies for winter wheat and summer maize in the major agricultural producing areas in northern China to mitigate the adverse effects of increased agricultural water use and extreme climates.

There is a need therefore to focus research efforts on these small coastal settlements in order to assist and support their communities to develop and implement adaptation. This article is an initial attempt to evaluate and categorise these issues for island settlements, based on case studies and general perspectives on adaptation. Six island settlement case studies are used from around the world: Cocos Islands (Australian territory); Shishmaref, USA; Broad Channel, USA; Samso, Denmark; Ciutadella de Menorca, Spain; and Port Vila, Vanuatu. This article describes and assesses impacts, adaptations, and capacity within each of the six case studies, and outlines the relationship of the Sustainable Development Goals system to small coastal settlements in general.

This study applied the Geographic Information System and statistical index method in LHM in Rwanda. Field surveys identified 336 points that were employed to construct a landslides inventory map. Ten landslides predicting factors were analyzed: normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, slope, aspects, lithology, soil texture, distance to rivers, distance to roads, rainfall, and land use. The factor variables were converted into categorized variables according to the percentile divisions of seed cells. Then, values of each factor's class weight were calculated and summed to create landslides hazard map. The estimated hazard map was split into five hazard classes (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high). The results indicated that the northern, western, and southern provinces are largely exposed to landslides hazard. The major landslides hazard influencing factors are elevation, slope, rainfall, and poor land management. Overall, this LHM would help policy makers to recognize each area's hazard extent, key triggering factors, and the required hazard mitigation measures. These measures include planting trees to enhance vegetation cover and reduce the runoff, and construction of buildings on low steep slope areas to reduce people's hazard exposure; while agroforestry and bench terraces would reduce sediments that take out the exposed soil (erosion) and pollute water quality. geographic information system; hazard; landslides; Rwanda;DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; CERTAINTY FACTOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; REGION; AREAS; VULNERABILITY; RAINFALL; RESILIENCE; EARTHQUAKE","Reuse and Recycling of Livestock and Municipal Wastewater in Chilean Agriculture: A Preliminary Assessment Chile is an agricultural power, but also one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and water shortage. About 50% of the irrigated agriculture land in Chile is in the central zone, thanks to its agricultural-climatic characteristics that provide an adequate water supply (100-4000 m(3)/s). However, the vulnerability scenario in this zone is high due to the seasonal availability of water resources. Therefore, opportunities to use non-conventional alternative sources (e.g., wastewater) become an appealing and feasible option due to the high population and animal density (>76%) in this part of the country. Moreover, the physicochemical characteristics of the municipal and livestock wastewater suggest that there are potential opportunities to recycle nutrients for agricultural production. In Chile, wastewater reuse opportunities are noted by the wide coverage of wastewater treatment programs, with municipal and intensified livestock production taking up most of the percentage (>99%). Nevertheless, more than 70% of wastewater treatment systems reach biological secondary treatment, which suggests reuse possibilities only for non-food crops. Therefore, this paper is focused on a preliminary analysis of the potential of reusing and recycling municipal and livestock wastewater for Chilean agriculture. There is some reuse work occurring in Chile, specifically in the use of municipal and livestock wastewater for cereal crops (animal feed), forests, and grasslands. However, aspects related to the long-term effects of these practices have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, municipal and livestock wastewater in Chile could be re-valued in agriculture, but the current quality and condition of treated wastewater do not ensure its safe use in food crops. In addition, state policies are needed to provide sustainability (circular and ethic economy) to water reusing/recycling in agriculture.

However, how and to what extent river damming can modify the hydrological function of wetlands remain largely unknown. In this study, we apply a distributed hydrological modeling platform for a larger river basin in Northeast China with a paired modeling scenario: (1) modeling with no dam present (i.e., under natural conditions), and (2) modeling with dam present (i.e., under disturbed conditions). The overarching goal of the study is to quantify the effect of damming on wetland hydrological processes. The modeling study demonstrates that river damming can alter the wetland effect on daily flow by significantly reducing flow under low flow conditions but slightly increasing flow under high flow conditions. Damming can impact the wetland function in alleviating floods with a 7% decrease when compared to the natural conditions without a dam. Consequently, the supporting effect of wetlands on baseflow is weakened substantially by damming regulation. These results indicate that river damming can impair flow regulation functions of downstream wetlands, and therefore, new flow regulation and optimization strategies for achieving complementary hydrological functions of wetlands and reservoirs are important to maximize basin resilience to hydrological extremes under climate change.

Young Merino wether sheep (n = 270) were allocated to one of three supplementation (Su) treatments and one of three regimes of nematode control (drench, Dr) in a factorial design. Each of the nine treatments was replicated three times in a randomised complete block. Animals received no supplement (SuO) or were given supplements at a level equivalent to 200 g day(-1), fed three times a week. The supplements contained 25% lucerne meal with either 75% sunflower meal (Su1) or 75% formaldehyde-treated sunflower meal (Su2). Nematode control regimes were: not drenched unless survival of individual animals was threatened (Dr0); drenched according to a strategic drenching programme (Dr1); treatment with a controlled-release albendazole capsule (Dr2). Infections with Haemonchus contortus were suppressed by use of closantel. Due to drought conditions and lack of pasture growth, lucerne hay was fed to all sheep from Week 14 onwards (350 g per head per day, fed twice a week). Supplementation reduced the need for 'survival drenching' in Dr0 sheep considerably. Live-weight gain was increased significantly by supplementation with Su1 or Su2 during the 36-week experiment. Undrenched animals given Su1 or Su2 tended to grow faster than unsupplemented animals in the Dr1 and Dr2 groups. Greasy wool production and fibre diameter were increased by supplementation and anthelmintic treatment. Faecal worm egg counts (FEC) in undrenched sheep were significantly lower for Su1 and Su2 sheep than for SuO sheep. There were no effects of supplementation on FEC in Dr1 or Dr2 sheep. Worm burden was generally unaffected by supplementation, while the drenching treatments Dr1 and Dr2 reduced worm burden at Week 16 and to a lesser extent at Week 27. Trichostrongylus colubriformis was the predominant nematode species, with smaller numbers of Nematodirus spp., Trichostrongylus vitrinus, Trichostrongylus axei and Ostertagia circumcincta also present. It was concluded that supplementary feeding with protein meal substantially reduced production losses attributable to nematode infections in young grazing sheep. This appears to be due to an enhanced resilience of the host, rather than any major changes in development of protective immunity.

In this paper we undertake a novel approach to studying resource growth problems using a computational form of adaptive management to find optimal strategies for prevalent natural resource management dilemmas. We scrutinize adaptive management, or learning-by-doing, to better understand how to simultaneously manage and learn about a system when its dynamics are unknown. We study important trade-offs in decision-making with respect to choosing optimal actions (harvest efforts) for sustainable management during change. This is operationalized through an artificially intelligent model where we analyze how different trends and fluctuations in growth rates of a renewable resource affect the performance of different management strategies. Our results show that the optimal strategy for managing resources with declining growth is capable of managing resources with fluctuating or increasing growth at a negligible cost, creating in a management strategy that is both efficient and robust towards future unknown changes. To obtain this strategy, adaptive management should strive for: high learning rates to new knowledge, high valuation of future outcomes and modest exploration around what is perceived as the optimal action. natural resource management; adaptive management; learning-by-doing; reinforcement learning; growth; climate change;SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FISHERIES MANAGEMENT; MARINE FISH; GOVERNANCE; CONSERVATION; UNCERTAINTY; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; LONG","Rehabilitating mangrove ecosystem services: A case study on the relative benefits of abandoned pond reversion from Panay Island, Philippines Mangroves provide vital climate change mitigation and adaptation (CCMA) ecosystem services (ES), yet have suffered extensive tropics-wide declines. To mitigate losses, rehabilitation is high on the conservation agenda. However, the relative functionality and ES delivery of rehabilitated mangroves in different intertidal locations is rarely assessed. In a case study from Panay Island, Philippines, using field- and satellite-derived methods, we assess carbon stocks and coastal protection potential of rehabilitated low-intertidal seafront and mid- to upper-intertidal abandoned (leased) fishpond areas, against reference natural mangroves. Due to large sizes and appropriate site conditions, targeted abandoned fishpond reversion to former mangrove was found to be favourable for enhancing CCMA in the coastal zone. In a municipality-specific case study, 96.7% of abandoned fishponds with high potential for effective greenbelt rehabilitation had favourable tenure status for reversion. These findings have implications for coastal zone management in Asia in the face of climate change. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Intermittent renewables increase the system-wide demand for flexibility and affect the operation of thermal power plants. We investigate the operation of future power plants by first composing a comprehensive overview of the operational flexibility of current and future power plants. Next, a combined long-term optimization and hourly simulation is performed with the soft-linked MARKAL-NL-UU and REPOWERS models for The Netherlands in 2030 and 2050. We quantify and compare the technical and economic performance of power plants for four distinctly different future scenarios. We find that future low-carbon power systems will have large shares of intermittent renewable sources (19-42%) and also a 2-38% higher variability in residual load compared to the Baseline scenario. Hence, power plant operation will be more variable, which reduces their efficiency by 0.6-1.6% compared to the full-load efficiency. Enough flexibility is present in future power systems to accommodate renewables, due to advances in power plant flexibility and interconnectors. As a result, generators with CCS have a large market share (23-64% of power generated). Moreover, the current energy-based market model generates insufficient revenues: the price received per MWh covers only 84% (+/- 30%) of the total generation costs per MWh of 77 (sic)/MWh (+/- 12(sic)). This will discourage new investments in generation capacity and reduce power system adequacy. New or additional market designs may be required to ensure system adequacy in future power systems.

Including such sub-grid variability alters the partitioning of net radiation between sensible heat flux and latent heat flux on land surface, which leads to changes in precipitation through various pathways/mechanisms. The areas with most substantial changes are Amazonia and Central Africa where convective rain is dominant and vegetation is very dense. In these areas, precipitation during December-January-February is increased by up to 2 mm/day. This increase is due to the enhanced large-scale circulation and atmospheric instability caused by including the sub-grid variability. Cloud feedback plays an important role in modifying the large-scale circulation and atmospheric instability. Turning off cloud feedback mitigates the changes in surface convergence and boundary layer height caused by inclusion of sub-grid variability of precipitation and water storage canopy, which moderate the effect on precipitation. nan;GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; SOIL-MOISTURE; SURFACE MODELS; CLIMATE MODELS; GLOBAL-MODELS; RAINFALL; GCM; REPRESENTATION; SENSITIVITY; FEEDBACK","Fiscal decentralization and economic growth revisited: an empirical analysis of poverty governance Based on the panel data of 24 provinces from 2010 to 2018, the static panel model was utilized to analyze the impact of fiscal decentralization and economic growth on poverty reduction, and the Moran index was used to calculate the spatial agglomeration effect of poverty degree. Further, we employed Spatial Dobbin model to examine the spatial effect of fiscal decentralization, economic growth, and poverty reduction. Findings of our results revealed that the rapid economic growth and fiscal revenue decentralization have a substantial inhibitory effect on poverty reduction, and fiscal expenditure decentralization has an important promoting influence on poverty reduction. Our results further showed that the degree of inter provincial poverty has significant effect on regional spatial agglomeration, indicating a pattern of high-value agglomeration in the northwestern and southern border areas and low-value agglomeration in the northeastern and central regions. Finally, the results revealed that economic growth rate and fiscal decentralization have spatial spillover effects on the poverty governance. Based on our study findings, policy suggestions are suggested, such as adjustment of the structure of fiscal expenditure, building a coordination mechanism between fairness and efficiency, and encouraging the activities of agricultural production departments.

While an increasing number of studies show that plasticity across generations (transgenerational plasticity or TGP) may occur, we have limited understanding of key aspects of TGP, such as the environmental conditions that may promote it, its relationship to within-generation plasticity (WGP) and its role in evolutionary potential. In this review, we consider how the detection of TGP in climate change experiments is affected by the predictability of environmental variation, as well as the timing and magnitude of environmental change cues applied. We also discuss the need to design experiments that are able to distinguish TGP from selection and TGP from WGP in multigenerational experiments. We conclude by suggesting future research directions that build on the knowledge to date and admit the limitations that exist, which will depend on the way environmental change is simulated and the type of experimental design used. Such an approach will open up this burgeoning area of research to a wider variety of organisms and allow better predictive capacity of the role of TGP in the response of organisms to future climate change. acclimation; adaptation; environmental predictability; maternal effects; non-genetic inheritance; paternal effects; phenotypic plasticity; selection; within-generation plasticity;TRANS-GENERATIONAL PLASTICITY; PARENTAL HYPOXIC EXPOSURE; CRYPTIC GENETIC-VARIATION; OFFSPRING SIZE VARIATION; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTABILITY; DEVELOPMENTAL PLASTICITY; NONGENETIC INHERITANCE; EMBRYONIC-DEVELOPMENT","Efficient strategies to assess yield stability in winter wheat Selecting contrasting environments allows decreasing phenotyping intensity but still maintaining high accuracy to assess yield stability. Improving yield stability of wheat varieties is important to cope with enhanced abiotic stresses caused by climate change. The objective of our study was to (1) develop and implement an improved heritability estimate to examine the required scale of phenotyping for assessing yield stability in wheat, (2) compare yield performance and yield stability of wheat hybrids and inbred lines, (3) investigate the association of agronomic traits with yield stability, and (4) explore the possibility of selecting subsets of environments allowing to portray large proportion of the variation of yield stability. Our study is based on phenotypic data from five series of official winter wheat registration trials in Germany each including 119-132 genotypes evaluated in up to 50 environments. Our findings suggested that phenotyping in at least 40 environments is required to reliably estimate yield stability to guarantee heritability estimates above 0.7. Contrasting the yield stability of hybrids versus lines revealed no significant differences. Absence of stable associations between yield stability and further agronomic traits suggested low potential of indirect selection to improve yield stability. Selecting posteriori contrasting environments based on the genotype-by-environment interaction effects allowed decreasing phenotyping intensity, but still maintaining high accuracy to assess yield stability. The huge potential of the developed strategy to select contrasting and informative environments has to be validated as a next step in an a priori scenario based on genotype-by-location interaction effects. nan;TRAITS; BARLEY; REPEATABILITY; STATISTICS; GENOTYPES; TRIALS","Interactive Effects of Fire and Nonnative Plants on Small Mammals in Grasslands Invasions by nonnative plants have changed the structure of many terrestrial ecosystems and altered important ecological processes such as fire, the dominant driver in grassland ecosystems. Reestablishing fire has been proposed as a mechanism to restore dominance of native plants in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants, yet fire may function differently in these altered systems, potentially affecting animals in novel ways. To assess whether invasions by nonnative plants alter the effects of fire on animals, we performed a manipulative experiment in semi-desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona that have been invaded by a perennial, nonnative grass from Africa, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). We applied fire to 36 of 54 1-ha plots established along an invasion gradient where dominance of E. lehmanniana ranged from 0% to 91% of total live plant biomass. Over the 5-year period from 2000 to 2004, we used mark-recapture methods to assess how population and community attributes of small mammals varied along the gradient of nonnative grass and in response to fire. We quantified changes in presence of 17 species, abundance of 9 species, total abundance of all species combined, species richness, and species composition. Based on 11,226 individual mammals from 24 species, we found that effects of nonnative-grass dominance varied with habitat preferences of each species, resulting in composition of the small-mammal community changing predictably along the invasion gradient. As dominance of nonnative grass increased, presence and abundance of granivorous heteromyids and insectivores (e. g., Chaetodipus, Perognathus, Onychomys; pocket mice and grasshopper mice) decreased, whereas presence and abundance of omnivorous and herbivorous murids (e. g., Reithrodontomys, Sigmodon; harvest mice and cotton rats) increased. Species richness of the small-mammal community averaged 8.4 species per plot and was highest at intermediate levels of nonnative-grass dominance where vegetation heterogeneity was greatest. Abundance of all small mammals combined averaged 26.9 individuals per plot and did not vary appreciably with nonnative-grass dominance. During the 4- to 8-week period immediately after fire, abundance of 6 of the 9 most common species changed, with 5 species decreasing and 1 species increasing on burned plots relative to unburned plots. During this same time period, species richness of small mammals decreased by an average of 3 species (38%) and total abundance of all species combined decreased by an average of 16 individuals (61%) on burned plots relative to unburned plots. Effects of fire on vegetation biomass, on presence of 9 of 17 mammalian species, and on abundance of 4 of 9 mammalian species remained evident >= 2 years after fire. Effects of fire on most small-mammal species varied with the degree of nonnative-grass dominance, suggesting that fire functioned differently in areas invaded by nonnative plants relative to areas dominated by native plants. Specifically, effects of fire on presence of 12 of 14 species and abundance of 7 of 9 species varied along the gradient of E. lehmanniana. During this post-fire period, however, composition of the small-mammal community in areas dominated by nonnative grass transitioned towards composition of areas dominated by native grasses, suggesting that fires had some restorative effect on habitat for small mammals. The relative strength of this effect will likely depend in general on the structural and compositional contrasts between invaded and native plant communities. Despite the reported neffectiveness of fire at reducing dominance of nonnative plants, restoring fire to grasslands invaded by nonnative plants can help maintain the mosaic of vegetation conditions necessary to support the diverse assemblage of animals that inhabit these fire-governed ecosystems.

However, detailed field-scale studies focussing on the soil and agronomic parameters of crops under these amendments are limited in dry tropical ecosystems. Therefore, we studied the impact of various soil amendments viz., rice-husk ash (RHA) and farmyard manure (FYM) along with mineral fertilizer on soil biophysical and agronomic parameters of wheat crop. We specifically explored the impact of the amendments on soil CO2 efflux (SCE, under different growth stages) and the harvest index of wheat crop, which are considered as the key indicators of soil viability and agronomic efficiency, respectively. SCE, soil moisture, soil temperature, soil N, microbial biomass and soil pH were found significantly varying under different treatments (P < 0.05). SCE was found maximum under sole FYM applied and minimum under mineral fertilizer applied treatments, whereas RHA application lowered the SCE as compared to sole FYM application. Moreover, SCE showed variation with plant growth stages, and found maximum during stem elongation followed by heading stage whereas minimum during ripening stage. Soil moisture was found to have considerable regulation for the overall variation in SCE (r(2) = 0.17; P = 0.04). In contrast to the soil properties, agronomic parameters (except harvest index) were found higher under mineral fertilizer applied treatments followed by sole FYM and combined FYM + RHA treatments, whereas sole RHA applied treatment showed minimum values. However, significant variations were observed only for harvest index, aboveground dry matter, grain and straw yields (P < 0.05). Further, harvest index was found highest under sole and combined FYM and RHA applied treatments whereas lowest in mineral fertilizer applied treatments. Soil C/N ratio (r(2) = 0.16; P = 0.04) and panicle length (r(2) = 0.18; P = 0.03), respectively as soil and agronomic parameters, have been found to have considerable control over harvest index. The findings revealed that soil viability is higher under sole FYM and combined FYM + RHA treatments whereas mineral fertilization enhances agronomic performance. Based on the studied two indicators, we conclude that both soil and agronomic sustainability can be maintained by using a combination of organic (FYM and RHA) fertilization with reduced inputs from mineral fertilizers. However, it further needs exploration for various soil and plant eco-physiological parameters of different crops at field level for wider adaptation in the dry tropical region.

Work Package 5 (WP5) provides the translational science on identification of: different users and providers, and their mandates; factors contributing to communication gaps and capacities between various users and providers; and mechanisms to work through such issues to develop and/or evolve a range of climate services. Key findings to emerge include that users from different sectors have varying capacities, requirements, and needs for information in their decision contexts, with a current strong preference for weather information. Separating climate and weather services when engaging users is often not constructive. Furthermore, there is a need to move to a service delivery model that is more user-driven and science informed; having sound climate science is not enough to develop services that are credible, salient, reliable, or timely for diverse user groups. Greater investment in building the capacity of the research community supporting and providing climate services to conduct translational sciences and develop regular user engagement processes is much needed. Such a move would help support the China Meteorological Administration's (CMA) ongoing efforts to improve climate services. It would also assist in potentially linking a broader group of ""super"" users who currently act as providers and purveyors of climate services because they find the existing offerings are not relevant to their needs or cannot access CMA's services. climate services; credibility; usefulness; diverse decision contexts; information users; information providers;nan","CERES-Rice model-based simulations of climate change impacts on rice yields and efficacy of adaptive options in Northeast China Global temperatures are rising, and concerns about the response of agricultural production to climate change are increasing. Adaptation is a key factor that will shape the severity of impacts of future climate change on food production. Based on actual meteorological, soil and agricultural management data at site scale, the CERES-Rice model, combined with the Regional Climate Model (RCM)-PRECIS, was used to simulate both the effects of climate change on rice yields and the efficacy of adaptive options in Northeast China. The impact simulation showed that rice yield changes ranged from +0.1% to -44.9% (A2 scenario) and from -0.3% to -40.1% (B2 scenario) without considering CO2 fertilisation effects. When considering CO2 fertilisation effects, rice yield reductions induced by temperature increases were decreased at all sites. The CO2 fertilisation effects may partly offset the negative impacts of climate change on rice yields. Adaptive option results revealed that the adverse impacts of climate change on rice yields could be mitigated by advancing the planting dates, transplanting mid-late-maturing rice cultivars to replace early-maturing ones, and breeding new rice cultivars with high thermal requirements. Our findings provide insight into the possible impacts of climate change on rice production, and we suggest which adaptive strategies could be used to cope with future climate change, thus providing evidence-based suggestions for government policy on adaptive strategies. adaptive options; CERES-Rice model; climate change impact; Northeast China; rice yield; simulation;ELEVATED CO2; WHEAT PRODUCTION; MAIZE PRODUCTION; CROP PRODUCTION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; ADAPTATION; FOOD; PHENOLOGY; RESPONSES; TRENDS","Representativeness of terrestrial ecosystems in Chile's protected area system Because protected areas are a major means of conservation, the extent to which ecosystems are represented under different protection regimes needs to be ascertained. A gap analysis approach was used to assess the representativeness of Chile's terrestrial ecosystems in differing kinds of protected areas. Terrestrial ecosystems were described in terms of potential vegetation, employing three protection scenarios. Scenario 1 was based exclusively on the Chilean National System of Protected Wild Areas (SNASPE). Scenario 2 included all types of public protected areas, namely SNASPE, nature sanctuaries and Ministry of National Heritage lands. Scenario 3 included all items in Scenario 2, but also included private protected areas and biodiversity priority sites. There is insufficient protection of terrestrial ecosystems under the Scenario 2. In addition to the low level of ecosystem protection provided by state protected areas (only 42 of the 127 terrestrial ecosystems had >10% of their area protected), 23 terrestrial ecosystems were identified as having no protection at the national level. Gaps in protection were concentrated in the North (both coastal and inland desertic scrub), Central (thorny scrub, thorny forests, sclerophyllous forests and deciduous coastal forests) and Austral (steppe ecosystems) regions of Chile. These gaps include ecosystems that are of global conservation importance.

These studies require the processing of millions of simulations to make assessments in national scales. Here we demonstrate a platform to run crop simulations with HTCondor as implemented across more than 120 000 cores on CSIRO network. The workflow of HTCondor usages was built through a server-client structure with standardized messages (simulations), which were queued by message queue sever. The new workflow maximized the performance of the CSIRO HTCondor service and could simultaneously utilize more than 8000 cores. A case study of 4.8 million APSIM simulations (ca. 2 mins each on model desktop), was completed in 32.5 h. This platform makes it is possible to assess all combinations of G x E x M in a short period. The generic platform has since been used to run other massive serial processing tasks.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is recognized as an efficient, sustainable, and feasible agricultural system that plays a vital role in addressing the potential impacts of climate change in Pakistan. First-hand information was collected from 450 farm households in 24 villages from Okara, Sahiwal, and Khanewal irrigation divisions, having various wheat-based cropping systems of Pakistan. This includes rice-wheat (RW), maize-wheat (MW), and cotton-wheat (CW) cropping systems in the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) irrigation system. This study estimated and compared the sustainability and efficiency analysis of CSA and conventional agricultural practices. This study also estimated the impact of water-smart practices of the CSA, technical training, and groundwater quality on agricultural production by using production function and bootstrap truncated regression. The findings of this study revealed that adopters of CSA of the wheat-based cropping systems have higher economic benefits and improved resource use efficiencies compared to the conventional farmers. The findings of the study also revealed the increased efficiency of CSA adopters over other two systems in CW cropping system. The water-smart practices of CSA, access to credit, technical training, use of groundwater of varying quality, and other inputs also showed variations in the agricultural production and resource use efficiency. It has been concluded that farmers can earn more profit, save inputs (such as water), and increase their production by adopting water-smart practices of CSA. Hence, the government and other relevant institutions should devise and implement policies that adequately addressed the importance and enhance the use of water-smart practices of CSA in Punjab and beyond.

But what, in this context, is meant by 'objective'? In practice, in an effort to address internal and external criticisms, the IPCC has regularly revised its methodological procedures; some of these procedures seem to meet the requirements of objectivity, at least as understood in a specific sense, but the relationship between objectivity and value-neutrality requires further investigation. The aim of this paper is to offer an appropriate philosophical account of objectivity, reconcilable with the fact that the IPCC is not value-free. I argue that Sandra Harding's notion of strong objectivity is particularly well suited to this goal, and I examine the extent to which the current IPCC procedures match her account.

This study evaluates the impact of drought on crop yield and cropping area over 10 climate zones in Texas from 2008 to 2016. It also depicts the spatiotemporal distribution of crop yield and cropping area changes at each climate zone across the state. We analyzed the impact of drought on crop yields and cropping areas before and after the 2011 severe drought using annual crop yields of four major crops. Results show that drought had a greater impact on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) and lesser impact on cotton (Gossypium spp.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] production across Texas. Cotton and corn hectarages were reduced during the drought period and increased after that, whereas winter wheat hectarage was reduced in the northern climate zones and increased in the southern climate zones before the drought. Results also indicate that drought impact on crop production may be reduced by replacing water-demanding crops such as corn with drought-tolerant crops such as sorghum and expanding irrigation hectarage during drought periods. It may be beneficial for Texas agricultural production to increase the hectarage of sorghum and other grains especially during drought periods. This study provides valuable information that can be used to adopt appropriate measures to cope with future drought challenges in drought-prone regions. nan;ADAPTING AGRICULTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HIGH-PLAINS; VARIABILITY","Public Attitudes toward Renewable Energy in Croatia Renewable energy sources (RES) play a key role in achieving the European Union's energy and climate objectives. As a member of the European Union, Croatia has committed to adopting European Directive 2009/28/EC, a directive on promoting the use of RES. Croatia shows good potential for the use of different types of RES. In the period 2009-2019, the share of renewable energy in energy consumption increased from 23.6 to 28.5 percent. The Croatian energy strategy aims to increase the national share of renewable energy to at least 32 percent by 2030. Acceptance and public support are essential for renewable energy to be introduced into energy policy and particularly to encourage renewable energy implementation in the residential sector. The purpose of the paper is to explore the public perception of renewable energy and citizens' willingness to pay for the use of RES. Data were collected through a 2021 survey of citizens 18 years and older. The survey results show a low level of implementation of RES technology in the residential sector; more than 80 percent of respondents did not use any sources of renewable energy in their households. Results related to respondents' knowledge of different sources of renewable energy suggest they have the most knowledge of solar, wind, and hydropower energy. Respondents believe that combating climate change, reducing dependency on energy imports, reducing environmental impacts, and improving health are the most important benefits of RES implementation. The survey reveals general support for RES among respondents; almost 89 percent of them would purchase renewable energy from local suppliers. In addition, 79 percent of survey participants were willing to pay for the introduction of RES technology into their households. The research shows that environmental concerns are the primary reason for citizens' higher willingness to pay for RES. renewable energy; economic impacts; environmental impact; citizens; green economy; knowledge; behavior; households; willingness to pay; survey;HUMAN-DEVELOPMENT INDEX; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSE RATES; IMPACT; CONSUMPTION; EUROPE; PREFERENCES; ACCEPTANCE; EMPLOYMENT","Systematic review approaches for climate change adaptation research Recent controversy has led to calls for increased standardization and transparency in the methods used to synthesize climate change research. Though these debates have focused largely on the biophysical dimensions of climate change, human dimensions research is equally in need of improved methodological approaches for research synthesis. Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applicability in an adaptation context. Customized review frameworks informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of systematic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice. We present guidelines, key considerations, and recommendations for systematic review in the social sciences in general and adaptation research in particular. We conclude by calling for increased conceptual and methodological development of systematic review approaches to address the methodological challenges of synthesizing and tracking adaptation to climate change.

The Agreement creates a global process of engagement, follow-up, regular stock-take exercises and cooperative action. On the one hand, it represents a step forward, overcoming the many divisions that had marked the Kyoto area: between developed and developing countries, between industrialized nations inside the Protocol and those outside, and between those supportive of market mechanisms and those that vehemently opposed them. On the other hand, individual country contributions fall short of the overall climate goal, and the risk is that the Paris Agreement remains a shell without sufficient action and support. It thus remains to be seen whether the Paris Agreement is the right framework through which to address the collective action problem of climate change.

From the perspective of construal level theory, decreasing psychological distance should not itself influence people's willingness to act but change the processes that underlie individual decision-making. We conducted two experiments in which we manipulated the psychological distance of climate change. We found that participants with a distant focus relied more on scepticism to represent risks and make decisions about supporting climate change, whereas participants with a proximal perspective relied more on fear when making such judgements. However, the predicted Fear x Distance interaction was only found when self-reported fear rather than experimentally manipulated fear was used as a moderator. Our results suggest that simply proximising won't increase engagement and call for a more differentiated perspective on the effects of psychological distance in the context of climate change.

The updated program, FullSWOF-ZG, was used to evaluate the performance of a road-bioretention strip (RBS) system and explore/understand key parameters of continuous RBS design. The program was validated using eight pervious surfaces under simulated rainfall events and tested with 20 experimental cases of a locally depressed curb inlet. The mean difference of simulated interception efficiencies (36.6%-86.0%) and observed interception efficiencies (34.8%-84.0%) of the curb inlet was 3.5%, which proves the program predicts the curb-inlet interception efficiency accurately. The 20 road-only and 20 RBS modeling cases were designed and modeled using the FullSWOF-ZG program. These case studies have different road lengths, curb inlet lengths, longitudinal slopes, cross slopes, bioretention-overflow inlet heights, and bioretention soil infiltration parameters. Only 34.6%-48.4% of the total runoff volume is intercepted by the RBS's curb inlet under heavy rainfall (250 mm/h) and the remaining part of the runoff flows downstream along the road, which may cause local inundation and become a safety hazard. The curb inlet becomes the bottleneck of the RBS system that could impede the runoff flowing into the bioretention strip for detention and infiltration to improve the stormwater quality. road-bioretention strip; hydraulic design calculation; curb inlet; FullSWOF_2D; sponge city paradigm; low impact development; stormwater management;OVERLAND-FLOW; PERFORMANCE; HYDROLOGY; REMOVAL; INLETS; RAIN","Identifying drivers of household coping strategies to multiple climatic hazards in Western Uganda: implications for adapting to future climate change This paper investigates what drives household coping strategies in rural Uganda under different climatic hazards. Rural households in sub-Saharan Africa draw on various coping strategies to reduce the impact of climatic hazards on their livelihoods. Research to date provides only limited understanding of how the coping strategy portfolio of households changes depending on the climatic stress. Using empirical data from Uganda, this research contributes to this gap by (1) exploring how household coping strategy relates to household characteristics and livelihood activity and (2) how these coping strategies vary depending on the hazard. Coping strategy is found to be hazard specific for households that lack market-orientated activities, whereas those with market access rely on economic activities regardless of hazard. To maintain and improve the livelihoods and coping strategies of those most vulnerable to climatic variability and change, policies that advocate diversification away from a sole reliance on customary activities need to recognize the level and opportunity for market-based activities. These interventions must account for different sensitivities to different hazards as well as the homogeneity of the community in order to effectively support rural communities to cope with climate variability. coping strategies; climate variability; livelihoods; extreme events; Uganda;DOUBLE-EXPOSURE; ADAPTATION; VULNERABILITY; POVERTY; LEVEL; DETERMINANTS; LIVELIHOODS; CAPACITY; IMPACTS; OPTIONS","Piscine predation on juvenile salmon in sub-arctic Alaskan rivers: Associations with season, habitat, predator size and streamflow Predation on anadromous salmon can have important consequences for both predators and prey. Salmon provide large seasonal pulses of energy and nutrients via carcasses, eggs and juveniles to many freshwater consumers, and conversely, predation can represent a significant source of mortality for juvenile salmon. Recent declines of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations in Alaska have raised concern that predation might inhibit their recovery. Here, we quantify patterns of predation by freshwater fishes on juvenile salmon across seasons, habitats, predator sizes and streamflow levels in the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of Alaska. We analysed piscivore stomach contents and identified prey using DNA sequence ""barcoding."" In coastal rivers, juvenile pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum (O. keta) salmon contributed heavily to Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) and Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma) diets, coho salmon (O. kisutch) prey were rare, and Chinook salmon were not detected. In interior rivers, Arctic grayling, burbot (Lota lota) and northern pike (Esox lucius) consumed small numbers of Chinook salmon. Predation on Chinook salmon was documented disproportionately in sloughs during a summer of exceptionally high streamflow. Dietary and distributional patterns suggested northern pike and burbot may exclude salmon from sloughs in low-gradient river reaches that would otherwise provide suitable rearing habitat. The data also provided tentative support for the hypothesis that high streamflow induces juvenile Chinook salmon to move from mainstem habitats into sloughs, where they face an increased risk of mortality. Incorporating predation risk into climate adaptation, fisheries management and habitat restoration decisions may help to facilitate Chinook salmon recovery.

Accounting for the different ways in which potential climate change scenarios can affect our infrastructure is paramount in determining appropriate adaptation and risk management strategies. Despite gaining some attention among researchers in recent years, this research area is still largely uninvestigated. Several studies have indicated bridges to be especially susceptible to the effects of climate change. This article presents the potential impacts of climate change on bridges and combines the findings of close to 70 research articles to construct a broad list of their possible adaptation techniques.

In this study, we evaluate local disaster recovery planning in eight southeastern states and find that such planning receives limited public support: Less than one-third of vulnerable local jurisdictions had a recovery plan, and those plans received low plan quality scores. Unfunded state mandates produce weaker plans than plans in other states without mandates. We find that a collaborative network of stakeholders initially intent on reordering priorities results in stronger plans. Takeaway for practice: Local recovery planning should be designed to operate under conditions of high uncertainty. Local jurisdictions can choose plan design options that reflect how they build capability for recovery planning: 1) standalone community-wide recovery plan; 2) comprehensive land use plan; 3) emergency management plan; and 4) small area recovery plan. Because recovery planning lacks a public constituency, and is new to most local jurisdictions, the stand-alone community-wide recovery plan design option is the most effective at building local commitment. This option involves a plan-making process that concentrates time, effort, and resources focused on a building a network of stakeholders who likely have the greatest responsibility in rebuilding efforts because they care most about the impacts of a disaster. resiliency; recovery plans; disasters;CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; INTERCODER RELIABILITY; QUALITY; MANDATES","Teaching Sustainable Development Goals in The Netherlands: a critical approach One of the main outcomes of the Rio+20 Conference was the agreement to set Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The most common terms in the17 goals are economic growth, resilience and inclusion, all of which are critically examined in this article. This article discusses how these goals are reflected within existing sustainability programs at a vocational college, and at the undergraduate and postgraduate university levels in The Netherlands. Within all three institutions the author has integrated lectures on sustainable development with specific emphasis on the SDGs. The aim was to engage students in critical discussion, allowing reflection on the issues and paradoxes that characterise the larger discourse of sustainability. The case studies illustrate how curriculum aimed at this awareness can be developed stimulating the students' recognition of critique of economic development, inclusion and resilience. As a result of the courses, the students were able to develop a certain degree of critical, imaginative, and innovative thinking about sustainable development in general and the SDGs in particular. Cradle to cradle and circular economy approaches were named as more promising for current production systems. This article concludes with the recommendation as to how the SDGs can be critically taught.

People affect ecosystems' capacity to deliver services that contribute to the well-being of humans and their resilience. The delivery of ecosystem services (ES) has often been considered as a linear and direct flow from nature to people without feedbacks or human inputs. We adjusted the widely used ES cascade to highlight how humans mediate each step in the ES delivery. We then applied the proposed framework to empirical field studies in Indonesia. We focused on the role of forested landscapes to increase rural people's resilience to climate hazards such as drought and floods. We found that human actions determine benefits from ES through several mechanisms (ES management, mobilization, allocation-appropriation, and appreciation). These mechanisms are influenced by peoples' decisions along the ES cascade, which depend on specific factors related to rules, assets, values, and spatial context. By facilitating or hindering ES flows, some stakeholders can determine who benefits from ES and influence the well-being of others. A better understanding of the mediating mechanisms, factors, and feedbacks in ES delivery can support the design of sound environmental assessments and sustainable land management practices.

Yet, because the emergency management model presumes that recovery quickly follows response, governments focus only on short-term, localized displacement. However, long-term and long-distance displacement exposes a gray area between immediate shelter and permanent housing, along with concerns about vulnerability, housing availability, and land development. We begin this article by discussing the transition between response and recovery. We then review literature regarding social vulnerability, displacement, provision of temporary housing, households' return decisions, and disaster-driven land development and housing construction processes. We close with thoughts on future research to increase planners' understanding of the issues involved and to help them craft effective policies. disasters; population displacement; affordable housing; social vulnerability; emergency management;SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; HAZARD; EARTHQUAKE; RECONSTRUCTION; GOVERNMENT; VIOLENCE; MODEL; WARS","Optimized Software Tools to Generate Large Spatio-Temporal Data Using the Datacubes Concept: Application to Crop Classification in Cap Bon, Tunisia In the context of a changing climate, monitoring agricultural systems is becoming increasingly important. Remote sensing products provide essential information for the crop classification application, which is used to produce thematic maps. High-resolution and regional-scale maps of agricultural land are required to develop better adapted future strategies. Nevertheless, the performance of crop classification using large spatio-temporal data remains challenging due to the difficulties in handling huge amounts of input data (different spatial and temporal resolutions). This paper proposes an innovative approach of remote sensing data management that was used to prepare the input data for the crop classification application. This classification was carried out in the Cap Bon region, Tunisia, to classify citrus groves among two other crop classes (olive groves and open field) using multi-temporal remote sensing data from Sentinel- 1 and Sentinel-2 satellite platforms. Thus, we described the new QGIS plugin ""Model Management Tool (MMT)"". This plugin was designed to manage large Earth observation (EO) data. This tool is based on the combination of two concepts: (i) the local nested grid (LNG) called Tuplekeys and (ii) Datacubes. Tuplekeys or special spatial regions were created within a LNG to allow a proper integration between the data of both sensors. The Datacubes concept allows to provide an arranged array of time-series multi-dimensional stacks (space, time and data) of gridded data. Two different classification processes were performed based on the selection of the input feature (the obtained time-series as input data: NDVI and NDVI + VV + VH) and on the most accurate algorithm for each scenario (22 tested classifiers). The obtained results revealed that the best classification performance and highest accuracy were obtained with the scenario using only optical-based information (NDVI), with an overall accuracy OA = 0.76. This result was obtained by support vector machine (SVM). As for the scenario relying on the combination of optical and SAR data (NDVI + VV + VH), it presented an OA = 0.58. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the new data management tool in organizing the input classification data. Additionally, our results highlight the importance of optical data to provide acceptable classification performance especially for a complex landscape such as that of the Cap Bon. The information obtained from this work will allow the estimation of the water requirements of citrus orchards and the improvement of irrigation scheduling methodologies. Likewise, many future methodologies will certainly rely on the combination of Tuplekeys and Datacubes concepts which have been tested within the MMT tool. crop classification; Sentinel-1; Sentinel-2; ARD; Datacubes; citrus; olive; interoperability; SVM; QGIS plugin; Earth observation;LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; DATA-CUBE; SPECKLE REDUCTION; FUSION; SAR; SENTINEL-2; MODEL; BACKSCATTER","Geopolitical Television Drama Within and Beyond the Nordic Region This article presents a framework for thinking about the intersections between geopolitics and Northern European television drama by examining the contemporary Nordic Noir genre of crime drama. Nordic Noir features not only the double plot that combines sociopolitical critique with crime drama, but also a third ""gaze"" that engages aesthetics and territorial features that further individual series' geopolitical critique. Nordic Noir has become especially attuned to contemporary geopolitical issues specific to its setting (climate change, East-West rivalries, etc.), through which viewers engage with region-specific geopolitical codes and visions. However, what happens when Nordic geopolitical television drama series are exported and transculturally adapted to different geopolitical and cultural realities? By examining the Southeast Asian localisation of The Bridge (Viu/HBO Asia, 2018-) that transforms Nordic Noir into ""tropical noir"", this article critically reflects on the geopolitical power and societal engagement of the Nordic Noir template both within and beyond the Nordic region.

However, the voluntary acceptance by landowners crucially depends on their economic outcome. We (i) assess the carbon sequestration potential of afforestation projects in various Chinese regions by comparing different tree species, project durations and regional particularities, (ii) analyze the costs and benefits of tree species used for timber and fruit production as well as bamboo, and (iii) compare them with alternative crops under different climatic and economic conditions. Finally, we calculate the minimum compensation required by farmers to convert cropland to forests assuming a joint production of timber or fruits and carbon sequestration. No compensation is needed when cropland with relatively low revenues is to be converted. In contrast, compensation payments must be high for converting land used for cash crops, such as sugarcane. For fruit trees, the amount of carbon sequestered is low, but selling fruits and nuts is quite profitable. Consequently, in most cases there is no compensation needed. The minimum price per carbon credit decreases with increasing project duration because more carbon is stored per hectare, and in consequence, the required payments per credit are lower. This does not hold for fast-growing trees like eucalyptus and poplar, for which the minimum price increases with extended project duration. Bamboo shows a high carbon sequestration potential, and becomes economically more attractive by including carbon revenues. Carbon credits can often compensate the opportunity costs of alternative land uses, except for afforestation on highly productive cropland. We demonstrate that the economic attractiveness of afforestation projects is strongly context dependent and varies substantially across regions. The findings can contribute to the cost-efficient design of carbon sequestration projects. The methodology can be applied to other regions in the developing world.

The plants were subjected to prolonged drought stress by withholding irrigation water. The relationship between predawn water potential and maximum stomatal conductance indicated significant differences in stomatal sensitivity to drought between the two varieties. Stomatal closure occurred at higher values of predawn water potential in Sabatiano compared with Mavrodafni. No significant differences were found in plant hydraulic conductance and osmotic potential at full turgor (pi(100)) between the two varieties. Leaf and root ABA concentrations increased more rapidly in Mavrodafni compared with Sabatiano at the beginning of the drought period. Furthermore, Mavrodafni also exhibited significantly higher xylem pH values as well as higher stomatal sensitivity to ABA and pH increase compared with Sabatiano. Results suggest that these two grapevine varieties might have evolved different strategies in order to adapt under drought conditions. In particular, the greater ability for drought adaptation in Sabatiano might be attributed to the more efficient regulation of stomatal closure. In contrast, chemical signalling in Mavrodafni seems to be the main mechanism for drought adaptation. abscisic acid; hydraulic conductance; isohydricity; stomatal conductance;PLANT HYDRAULIC CONDUCTANCE; SOURCED ABSCISIC-ACID; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; XYLEM SAP; COMPARTMENTAL DISTRIBUTION; INTACT LEAVES; ABA; REDISTRIBUTION; DEFICIT; STRESS","Declining human activity intensity on alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau Climate change and human activities have profoundly changed the structure and functioning of alpine grassland ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau, the most critical ecological safety shelter for Asia. However, it remains unclear to what degree human activity intensity has impacted the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. Here we quantify human activity intensity on alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau based on the relationship between actual and potential net primary production. We found that human activity intensity decreased by 16.1% from 2000 to 2017 across the alpine grasslands, which might be driven by recent ecological conservation policies, especially reductions in livestock numbers. Critical thresholds, which show marked grassland responses to different levels of human disturbances, were identified for each ecozone. The net primary production of dry grasslands on the western ecozones was more resistant to human disturbances but with lower resilience than other alpine grasslands on the plateau. Our findings are beneficial to design practical countermeasures to adapt to climate change and recover damaged grasslands on Tibetan Plateau.

Our study examines the range of research approaches and findings regarding the role of green roofs in mitigating urban heat and enhancing human comfort. This review provides an overview of 89 studies conducted in three main climate types (hot-humid, temperate, and dry), from 2000 till 2020. All of the reviewed studies confirm the cooling effect of green roofs and its contribution to reduced heat island intensity regardless of the background climatic condition. However, dry climate has the highest (3 degrees C) median cooling effect of green roofs among all the climates investigated. Hot- humid climate presents the lowest cooling potential (median = 1 degrees C) of green roofs among all the climate types. Moreover, green roofs contribute a median surface temperature reduction of 30 degrees C in hot-humid cities. This value is relatively low for temperate climates (28 degrees C). Notably, no study has examined the impact of green roofs on surface temperature reduction in dry climates. This review can benefit urban planners and various stakeholders. ","Comparative embryo/larval sensitivity of Australian marine bivalves to ten metals: A disjunct between physiology and phylogeny Metal contamination within the urbanized coastal zon is one threat linked to a decline in the abundance, distribution and/or species diversity of wild marine bivalve populations. This study determined the 48-h embryo/larval sensitivity (no-effect concentration (NEC) and median-effect concentration (EC50)) of ten marine bivalve species (nine endemic to Australia) to aluminium (Al), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), key metal contaminants impacting urbanized coastal zones in south-eastern Australia, in natural seawater (20-22 degrees C, 30 parts per thousand salinity, pH 7.8-7.9, 1.2 mg/L dissolved organic carbon). For all metals, except Fe, the order of sensitivity was oysters >= mussels >= scallops >= cockles >= clams, where the economically-important oysters, Magallana gigas and Saccostrea glomerate, were 2.6 (Al) to 4.2 (Cd) times more sensitive than the least sensitive clam species. For all bivalve species, the order of metal sensitivity was Cu > Pb > Zn = Ni > Co > Cd > Al > Cr(VI) > Mn >= Fe( III), where Cu was eight times more toxic than Zn or Ni, 28 times more toxic than Cd, 220 times more toxic than Cr(VI) and 570 times more toxic than Fe(III). Iron, unlike the other nine soluble metals, occurred as particulate Fe(III) oxyhydroxide, where EC50 values decreased with increasing exposure time as the larval (D-veliger) stage. There was no significant (p > 0.05) effect ofembryo/larval mass, or surface area/volume, on metal sensitivity. Further, there was no significant (p > 0.05) relationship between metal sensitivity and phylogeny (genetic distance). Divalent metal sensitivity was positively related (r(2) = 0.87) to cell surface metal-binding affinity. The current Australian marine water quality guideline for Ni is not protective of the ten bivalve species (NECs were 2-6-fold below the guideline), while the guideline for Zn is not protective of oysters.

Although currently Little used in Britain, the technique of underplanting allows regeneration and diversification of stands while avoiding some of the disadvantages of clearfelling. Two experiments were examined: (1) the growth and survival of five underplanted conifer species of differing shade tolerance in a shelterwood and (2) compared performance of underplanted and open-grown Douglas-fir seedlings on restocking sites. Underplanted Sitka spruce, Norway spruce, noble fir, European silver fir and Douglas-fir were all able to survive and grow. However increased exposure following overstorey removal resulted in some damage and 'socketing', especially to taller seedlings, particularly Douglas-fir. This may be linked to poor root development when growing under an overstorey. Microclimate conditions on some underplanted sites were more sheltered from extreme climatic conditions, and in some cases this improved survival of Douglas-fir seedlings. However, seedling growth rates were reduced compared with those on open sites probably due to Lower Light Levels. Underplanting may help to improve establishment success of some species, particularly in exposed areas. However, the shelter benefits of underplanting must be carefully balanced against the trade-off with Lower Light, and underplanting is Likely to be more successful where low canopy density is maintained. nan;SPRUCE PICEA-SITCHENSIS; DOUGLAS-FIR; SITKA SPRUCE; NORWAY SPRUCE; SHADE TOLERANCE; FROST DAMAGE; ADVANCE REGENERATION; NATURAL REGENERATION; WHITE SPRUCE; GROWTH","Adaptive management for complex communal rangelands in South Africa Many of the intransigent problems facing the world arise in complex systems. In this paper, I propose that communal rangelands in South Africa be recognised as complex social-ecological systems and that one of the reasons that development initiatives have had little impact on improving livelihoods and rangeland condition is that interventions have been based on reductionist thinking that has failed to recognise non-linearities and uncertainties in the system. This complexity resides in ecological, social and economic components of the system, and is characterised by dynamics operating at different scales within and beyond the boundaries of the rangelands. People and the environment are vulnerable to change in these systems from factors such as changing climate, economics, governance arrangements, as well as disasters. Policy that promotes adaptability and resilience, and is itself responsive to changing dynamics, should be sought.

For the first time, this study estimates the biomass and carbon storage potential of Northeast India's diverse land uses through a biomass estimation model developed for this region. The mean tree density in tropical, subtropical, and temperate forests was 539, 554, and 638 trees ha(-1), respectively. The mean vegetation carbon stock was the highest for temperate forests (122.09 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by subtropical plantations (115.45 Mg C ha(-1)), subtropical forests (106.01 Mg C ha(-1)), tropical forests (105.33 Mg C ha(-1)), tropical plantations (93.00 Mg C ha(-1)), and temperate plantations (50.10 Mg C ha(-1)). Among the forests, the mean soil organic carbon (SOC) stock up to 45 cm depth was the highest for tropical forests (72.54 Mg C ha(-1)), followed by temperate forests (63.4 Mg C ha(-1)) and subtropical forests (42.58 Mg C ha(-1)). A strong relationship between the tree basal area and biomass carbon storage was found for all land-use types. The land-use transformation from agriculture to agroforestry, and grassland to plantations increased both vegetation carbon (VC) and SOC stocks. The corresponding increase in VC and SOC was 40.80 and 43.34 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in the former, and 83.18 and 97.64 Mg C ha(-1) in the latter. In general, the landscape-level estimates were drawn from site-level estimates in a given land-use type, and therefore, the corresponding values might be overestimated. Nevertheless, the results provide baseline information on carbon stock which may serve as a reference for devising appropriate land-use change policies in the region.</p> nan;biodiversity hotspots; carbon storage; forest types; land use; species richness","Mountain adaptation of caprine herding in the eastern Pyrenees during the Bronze Age: A stable oxygen and carbon isotope analysis of teeth Pastoral activities in the northeastern Pyrenees increased substantially during the Bronze Age, raising the question of the modalities of occupations in zones where the snow cover limited access to grasslands for a significant part of the year. The present study explores how stable isotope analysis may characterize the adaptation of husbandry to mountain environments through herding strategies, including the vertical mobility of livestock. It also addresses the broader issue of the occupation of territories by Bronze Age communities in the Western Mediterranean area, focusing on possible links between coastal plains and mountainous areas. For this purpose, sequential stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses were conducted on caprines' teeth from the mountain site of Llo (Pyrenees-Orientales, 1630 m asl, Middle Bronze Age) and the permanent coastal site of Portal-Vielh (Herault, 0 m asl, Late Bronze Age). An exploratory analysis was also conducted on modern sedentary and transhumant ewes to investigate the effect of altitudinal mobility on enamel oxygen isotope values. The range of delta O-18 values measured in modern and archaeological caprines raised in mountain zones was lower than the one measured in the lowland caprines, while no significant difference could be observed in the range of delta C-13 values. Co-variations between delta C-13 and delta O-18 sequences reveal the most information. The positive correlation observed in all instances at low elevation sites was not the leading pattern at Llo, where a variety of schemes could be observed, including opposite delta C-13 and delta O-18 sequences. This opposition could not be explained by a reversal of the delta O-18 cycle due to vertical mobility. Other causes could involve changes in the pattern of variation of delta C-13 values, potentially linked to human responses to the local constraints, including vertical mobility and/or foddering. Portal-Vielh delivered a fully lowland signal. At Llo, although a full adaptation to a mountain environment seems clear, the question of the vertical mobility of the livestock cannot be resolved at the moment. Most importantly, Llo was characterized by a high inter-individual variability in the co-variation of delta C-13 and delta O-18 profiles, reflecting great plasticity of the husbandry practices on the inter-annual scale. This could have been a key to the adaptation to these marginal environments. The apparent disjunction between the coastal and mountain settlements, as far as herd trajectory is concerned, must be reaffirmed by further investigations in a larger number of sites.

We analyse new research across the social sciences to show that climate change threatens cultural dimensions of lives and livelihoods that include the material and lived aspects of culture, identity, community cohesion and sense of place. We find, furthermore, that there are important cultural dimensions to how societies respond and adapt to climate-related risks. We demonstrate how culture mediates changes in the environment and changes in societies, and we elucidate shortcomings in contemporary adaptation policy. nan;PLACE ATTACHMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; COMMUNITY; IDENTITY; VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; TRANSFORMATION; RESETTLEMENT; ANTHROPOLOGY; CITIZENSHIP","Mechanisms for policy (dis)integration: explaining food policy and climate change adaptation policy in the Netherlands Recent years have witnessed increased political interest to the challenge of organizing policy integration to govern societal problems that crosscut the boundaries of traditional government sectors and levels, including climate change, food insecurity, terrorism, and the instability of financial markets. Public policy scholars have recently suggested to study such attempts by conceptualizing policy integration as a multi-dimensional process. Although such a processual perspective has helped to comparatively assess policy (dis)integration, the mechanisms of (dis)integration over time remain undertheorized. Past studies have reported a number of relevant factors, but these have remained rather functionalistic observations that lack explanatory value. To address this gap, we propose a mechanism-based approach that uncovers the political processes that underlie policy (dis)integration over time. Rooted in different strands of social science literature, the mechanistic approach offers a model of causation to assess the plausible chain of key processes that are triggered under particular contextual conditions. We illustrate the framework by empirically investigating the mechanisms that explain the policy (dis)integration of food and climate change adaptation policy in the Netherlands. We end the paper with discussing various implications of our findings for processual approaches to policy integration.

The effects of place attachment intensity and place attachment styles on the link between perception of risk and emotional and behavioral coping The general aim is to advance the understanding of the role of both place attachment intensity and place attachment styles for adaptive coping strategies with flood risk. Place attachment styles are operationalized as secure, preoccupied, and fearful-avoidant. Risk coping strategies are conceptualized as emotional (i.e., distress), and behavioral coping strategies (i.e., positive, negative, and avoidant). Two main cross-sectional studies were conducted in both high and low-risk areas: one study in Italy (N = 100) and one study in Romania (N = 391). The first study aims to test the moderating effect of place attachment intensity and place attachment styles both on the relation between perception of risk and distress; and on the relation between perception of risk and positive, avoidant and negative behavioral coping. The second study tests the effects of place attachment styles on the relation between the objective risk level and both emotional and behavioral coping. Results show that, in the high-risk context, people with a higher place attachment or having a secure bond with the place, are more likely to feel distress, and less likely to use avoidant coping strategies when the perceived risk is high. As for the low-risk context, people having a fearful-avoidant bond are more inclined to choose avoidant coping when the perceived risk is high. When taking into account the actual risk level, and not the perceived risk, people with a secure bond will more likely choose positive coping, as opposed to people with a fearful-avoidant place attachment when exposed to a higher risk. Place attachment style can thus be a relevant variable affecting strategies of environmental risk coping, at both emotional and behavioral level: specifically, a secure place attachment style, though favoring psychological distress, can improve a more constructive and adaptive behavioral strategy in face of higher perceived or objective flood risk. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVACUATION; BELIEFS; REPRESENTATIONS; ADAPTATION; ACTIVATION; ADULTHOOD; SYSTEM; THREAT; SENSE","Estimating the magnitude and risk associated with heat exposure among Ghanaian mining workers Many occupational settings located outdoors in direct sun, such as open cut mining, pose a health, safety, and productivity risk to workers because of their increased exposure to heat. This issue is exacerbated by climate change effects, the physical nature of the work, the requirement to work extended shifts and the need to wear protective clothing which restricts evaporative cooling. Though Ghana has a rapidly expanding mining sector with a large workforce, there appears to be no study that has assessed the magnitude and risk of heat exposure on mining workers and its potential impact on this workforce. Questionnaires and temperature data loggers were used to assess the risk and extent of heat exposure in the working and living environments of Ghanaian miners. The variation in heat exposure risk factors across workers' gender, education level, workload, work hours, physical work exertion and proximity to heat sources is significant (p<0.05). Mining workers are vulnerable to the hazards of heat exposure which can endanger their health and safety, productive capacity, social well-being, adaptive capacity and resilience. An evaluation of indoor and outdoor Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) in the working and living environment showed that mining workers can be exposed to relatively high thermal load, thus raising their heat stress risk. Adequate adaptation policies and heat exposure management for workers are imperative to reduce heat stress risk, and improve productive capacity and the social health of mining workers.

It is produced under a state procurement policy, according to which farmers have to allocate half of their land for cotton, fulfill cotton output levels and sell the entire harvest of cotton to the state. Land is state owned and a land consolidation process is in place, where land allocated to a farm can be reduced if cotton production targets are not met. However, low production levels may not only arise due to bad management practices but also due to production risks, e.g., due to climatic variability or limited access to inputs such as irrigation water. In this study, we aim to assess policies that can improve cotton production levels and farm profits under land consolidation and agricultural risks. We use a recursive programming model, which considers risk-averse farmers and their farm size adjustments, together with irrigation water-crop yield response functions on different land productivity classes. We consider production, market and institutional risks and find that such risks affect resource allocation, production levels and thus also farm size developments. The farm land consolidation improves overall cotton output, yet, it reduces farm incomes as the state cotton procurement price is low. Under conditions of the state cotton procurement and land consolidation, increasing the cotton price can improve cotton production and farm profits and reduce farm size changes, but farm size changes still occur among farmers. Having secure land tenure together with land use flexibility and higher cotton prices allows farmers to improve incomes, reduce income disparity, diversify land uses, but results in lower cotton output than under the state cotton procurement policy.

The objectives, type of deposition, borrow area, responsible entities and geographic distribution of each intervention were identified and are herein briefly presented and discussed. Beach nourishments were mostly carried out to improve the stability of the coastline, as a mitigation measure for coastal erosion, and to increase beach width for recreational use, as a tool for adding value to the coast. Operations concentrated in: 1) urban areas where erosion can pose risks to people and assets, 2) close to river mouth/inlets where port structures are established, and 3) touristic areas with high recreational value. Port Administrations contributed most (in number and volume) for the nourishment operations (62% of all operations), favouring the placement of the dredged sediments on the nearshore, and, more recently, providing the sediment of opportunity for subaerial beach fills and/or dune reinforcement carried out in cooperation with the State Environment/Coastal Authorities. The increase in the number of beach nourishments was accompanied by a decrease in the number of ""hard"" coastal structures, concurring to the optimization of an integrated coastal sediment management policy, in a clear paradigm shift that started in the 90s in regard to the coastal protection/defence strategy. There is a growing awareness regarding the beneficial use of sediments dredged by Ports to counter the coastal sediment deficit, making coastal nourishments mainly supply-driven in mainland Portugal. Beach nourishment practice has evolved to be the major contributor to a regional and national-scale coastal protection strategy focused on coastal sediment management.

CRIDA guidelines complement existing institutional guidance on recognizing circumstances when more complex risk-based climate analysis may be needed, above those required by standard planning procedures. The procedures are based on the concept of 'decision-scaling' judgments to qualitatively assess levels of future risk and analytical uncertainty stemming from climate change-related uncertainties, and as a guide for choosing specific analytical approaches and appropriate levels of analysis. CRIDA addresses how much detail is appropriate for a given problem setting, depending on infrastructure type and function, whether it is new design or rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, modular design or long-life infrastructure. CRIDA was structured to resolve the contentious issue of deciding under what circumstances a 'top-down' climate scenario-driven analysis ought to be conducted versus a more traditional 'bottom-up' vulnerability assessment, based on conventional agency project feasibility procedures. The procedures for such vulnerability assessments and planning procedures are well-represented in classical approaches, such as those included in the 1983 U.S. Water Resources Council's 'Principles and Guidelines'. These commonly used procedures promote normative evaluation protocols and decision rules that generate alternative solutions which minimize risk-cost outcomes.

Chloride ingress leads to corrosion initiation and its interaction with service loading could reduce its operational life. Chloride ingress and corrosion propagation are highly influenced by weather conditions in the surrounding environment including climate change. Therefore, both structural design and maintenance should be adapted to these new environmental conditions. This study focuses on the assessment of the costs and benefits of climate adaptation strategies for existing RC structures subjected to chloride ingress and climate change. We studied RC structures built at different periods under different construction standards in France. The cost-effectiveness of adaptation measures was measured in terms of the benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) and the probability that BCR exceeds unity - i.e. Pr(BCR > 1). The results of the paper could provide practical advice to policy-makers to improve the management of existing RC structures under a changing climate by discussing the influence of the following factors on the mean BCR and Pr(BCR > 1): specific exposure conditions, climate change scenarios, risk reduction due to the implementation of adaptation strategies, type of structural component, years of construction and adaptation, discount rates and damage costs. concrete structures; reliability & risk analysis; benefit cost ratios; chlorides; durability; maintenance & inspection; temperature effects; climate change; adaptation;RC STRUCTURES; COVER CRACKING; MAINTENANCE; DURABILITY; INITIATION; SCENARIOS; TIME","Seven lessons for planning nature-based solutions in cities Nature-based solutions are proliferating in European cities over the past years as viable solutions to urban challenges such as climate change, urban degeneration and aging infrastructures. With evidence amounting about nature-based solutions, there is a need to translate knowledge about nature-based solutions to future policy and planning. In this paper, we analysed fifteen cases of nature-based solutions' experiments across 11 European cities. What makes our case studies stand out is the balanced focus between ecosystem and social benefits in contrast to many published cases on nature-based solutions that have a weighted focus on the climate benefits. From a cross-case comparative analysis we draw seven overarching lessons related to all stages of proof-of-concept and implementation of nature-based solutions in cities: (a) nature-based solutions need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens, (b) nature-based solutions create new green urban commons, (c) experimenting with nature-based solutions requires trust in the local government and in experimentation process itself, (d) co-creation of nature-based solutions requires diversity and learning from social innovation, (e) nature-based solutions require collaborative governance, (f) an inclusive narrative of mission for nature-based solutions can enable integration to many urban agendas and (g) design nature-based solutions so as to learn and replicate them on the long-term. The lessons we draw show that nature-based solutions require multiple disciplines for their design, diversity (of settings) for co-creation and recognition of the place-based transformative potential of nature-based solutions as 'superior' to grey infrastructure. We further discern that urban planners need to have an open approach to collaborative governance of nature-based solutions that allows learning with and about new appealing designs, perceptions and images of nature from different urban actors, allows forming of new institutions for operating and maintaining nature-based solutions to ensure inclusivity, livability and resilience.

For quality apple production in the orchards, knowledge of the real timing of phenological stages is essential for scientific management decisions. In the Kashmir region, the year 2017 had a normal weather phenomenon, whereas the year 2018 had an erratic weather phenomenon wherein unusually high temperatures prevailed in the winter months and may be a clear sign of climate change effect. Due to this higher temperature in winter months of the year 2018 before bud break, earliness of phenological stages happened as compared to the year 2017, viz. silver tip stage by 5.67 days, green tip stage by 6.61 days, pink bud stage by 10.09 days, initial bloom by 10.43 days, full bloom by 9.70 days, and petal fall by 8.00 days. The flowering duration was overall recorded 2.43 days more in 2018 as compared to that in 2017. Due to the earliness of phenological stages in 2018, all twenty-five cultivars of the apple remained at high risk of spring frost and scientific apple orchard interventions were badly hit as growers were surprised and unprepared. The information generated will be very useful for growers, students, researchers, policy makers, and all the concerned stakeholders to understand how apple phenology responds to normal and extreme erratic weather conditions and may happen more frequently in the future due to climate change.

PF. WRF is a new model that is a combination of the Weather Research and Forecasting ( WRF) atmospheric model and a parallel hydrology model (ParFlow) that fully integrates three-dimensional, variably saturated subsurface flow with overland flow. These models are coupled in an explicit, operator-splitting manner via the Noah land surface model (LSM). Here, the coupled model formulation and equations are presented and a balance of water between the subsurface, land surface, and atmosphere is verified. The improvement in important physical processes afforded by the coupled model using a number of semi-idealized simulations over the Little Washita watershed in the southern Great Plains is demonstrated. These simulations are initialized with a set of offline spinups to achieve a balanced state of initial conditions. To quantify the significance of subsurface physics, compared with other physical processes calculated in WRF, these simulations are carried out with two different surface spinups and three different microphysics parameterizations in WRF. These simulations illustrate enhancements to coupled model physics for two applications: water resources and wind-energy forecasting. For the water resources example, it is demonstrated how PF. WRF simulates explicit rainfall and water storage within the basin and runoff. Then the hydrographs predicted by different microphysics schemes within WRF are compared. Because soil moisture is expected to impact boundary layer winds, the applicability of the model to wind-energy applications is demonstrated by using PF. WRF and WRF simulations to provide estimates of wind and wind shear that are useful indicators of wind-power output. nan;SPATIALLY-VARIABLE WATER; ENERGY-BALANCE PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE SCENARIOS; SURFACE-HYDROLOGY MODEL; OKLAHOMA-TEXAS DROUGHT; SOUTHERN GREAT-PLAINS; LAND-SURFACE; SOIL-MOISTURE; MESOSCALE MODEL; BOUNDARY-LAYER","Late Glacial-early holocene vegetation and environmental changes in the western Iberian Central System inferred from a key site: The Navamurio record, Bejar range (Spain) A new record from a long sediment core (S3) in Navamuno (1505 m asl, western Iberian Central System) provides the reconstruction of the vegetation history and environmental changes in the region between 15.6 and 10.6 ka cal BP, namely during the Late Glacial and the early Holocene, using a multiproxy analysis (pollen-based vegetation and climate reconstruction, sedimentary macrocharcoals, loss-on-ignition, magnetic susceptibility and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements). The results are then compared with other sequences from the Iberian Central System and the whole Iberian Peninsula in order to better understand the past dynamics of the main forest constituents. The pollen record shows a shift from open pine forests similar to 15.6-14.7 ka cal BP (Oldest Dryas) to mixed open pine-birch woodlands similar to 14.7-14.0 ka cal BP (Belling). Woodlands were succeeded by a steppe-like landscape until similar to 13.4 ka cal BP (Older Dryas), which was replaced again by high-mountain pine forests and riparian woodlands similar to 13.4-12.6 ka cal BP (Altered). A great development of cold steppe grasslands linked to the decline of birch woodlands is documented similar to 12.6-11.7 ka cal BP (Younger Dryas). The early Holocene (11.7-10.6 ka cal BP) was characterized by a progressive reforestation of the study area by pine and birch forests in the highlands and oak woods in the lowlands. Temperate tree taxa (Carpinus betulus, Castanea saliva, Corylus avellana, Fraxinus, Juglans, Tilia, and Ulmus) were also common but likely at lower elevations. Pollen of Fagus sylvatica was already recorded during the Late Glacial and the early Holocene. The marked increasing local fire activity during the warmer and wetter Altered oscillation could be related to a rise in tree cover, supporting the climatically driven character of these fires. Nevertheless, the strong increase in fire activity during the Younger Dryas would probably be related to growing tree and shrub mortality, as well as to the wet/dry biphasic structure of this stadial. The standard ""Modern Analogue Technique"" has been also applied to the Navamuno sequence to provide quantitative climate estimations for the Late Glacial and the early Holocene periods. This record is one of the few continental archives that show the climatic trend between the Late Glacial and the early Holocene in central Iberia, agreeing with many other regional records from the Western Mediterranean.

Thus, estimating water storage in alpine glaciers is critical for predicting the trend of glacier melting. This study compiled a rich set of ice thickness observations for glaciers of varying sizes in western China. We here presented a first-order assessment of the various errors involved in interpreting ice thickness from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) observations. An empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) method was used for ice thickness interpolation and volume estimation. We then established a new volume-scaling law specific to western China glaciers based on these 36 volume-area pairs. And together with the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI), we obtain a regional volume estimate of 4451 +/- 298 km(3). By comparison, we believed that this result is the most reliable estimate of the total ice storage in western China and more reliably predicts gross glacier melting. However, our results show that the method of glacier division can strongly affect the total volume estimation, which previous studies ignored. This emphasizes the need for more surveyed glaciers data and more accurate glacier inventory to improve the evaluation of the climate impact on glacier melting water resources and to help ensure the future survival of these alpine glaciers.

This study compares different routes for RJF production integrated with sugarcane biorefineries in Brazil. Eight scenarios with sugarcane mills annexed to three ASTM approved RJF production technologies, i.e. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FT), and Alcohol to Jet (ATJ), were assessed. Host mills were considered to crush four million tonnes of sugarcane/year and recover straw from the field. In the designed scenarios, HEFA routes processed palm, macauba, or soybean oils, while FT conversion was based on gasification of either sugarcane or eucalyptus lignocellulosic material, and ATJ - converted isobutanol or ethanol into RJF. The biorefineries were assessed in terms of both economic and environmental performance, as well as towards their capability of substituting 5% of the consumption of jet fuel in Brazil in 2014 (equivalent to 375 million L/year). Considering the evaluated scenarios, HEFA-based biorefineries yielded the highest RJF production capacities: a single plant processing palm oil could supply 267 million L RJF/year (71% of the defined target). FT biorefineries presented the best economic performances, producing RJF at competitive cost but with a relatively low output. Finally, all conversion technologies were capable of producing RJF with low climate change impacts, with reductions of over 70% when benchmarked against fossil jet fuel. Carbon mitigation targets of the Brazilian aviation sector are further explored in this paper, showing the dimension of the effort in the coming years for fossil jet fuel replacement in commercial flights. The availability of sugarcane and other biomasses in the country makes Brazil a potentially important player for the deployment of large-scale projects with reasonable RJF market prices and reduced CO2 emissions for both internal and external markets.

The spatio-temporal pattern of rice exposure to heat stress (EHS) would provide strong supports for decision makers particularly in China, to cope with increasing heat stress threats under global warming. To obtain reliable assessments, the study period needs no less than thirty years. But how much would different temporal scales affect rice EHS pattern in China? Whether these differences potentially affect adaptation decisions? These problems still remain unclear. Here, we assessed the spatio-temporal patterns of rice EHS at three typical-used scales (1980-2009, 1970-2009 and 1960-2009), and accordingly projected EHS over the 2010s to further explore which scale could better capture recent EHS levels in China. The results showed that in the east of Sichuan Basin and the northwest of the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River, EHS was highest over 1960-2009, whereas southern China saw highest EHS over 1980-2009. The temporal pattern saw large differences in both the areas with significant trends and their trend levels, showing particular hot spots over 1980-2009. The projected EHS based on the datasets over 1970-2009 were more consistent with those over the 2010s in most cases. Based on the patterns at different temporal scales, adaptation decisions would also show different characteristics, such as more attentions would be paid to the south of Anhui province over the scale of 1980-2009. heat stress; spatial pattern; temporal scale; China;INCREASE","Alternative responses to rare selection events are differentially vulnerable to changes in the frequency, scope, and intensity of environmental extremes Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, severe, and/or widespread as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. While the economic and ecological implications of these changes have received considerable attention, the role of evolutionary processes in determining organismal responses to these critical challenges is currently unknown. Here we develop a novel theoretical framework that explores how alternative pathways for adaptation to rare selection events can influence population-level vulnerabilities to future changes in the frequency, scope, and intensity of environmental extremes. We begin by showing that different life histories and trait expression profiles can shift the balance between additive and multiplicative properties of fitness accumulation, favoring different evolutionary responses to identical environmental phenomena. We then demonstrate that these different adaptive outcomes lead to predictable differences in population-level vulnerabilities to rapid increases in the frequency, intensity, or scope of extreme weather events. Specifically, we show that when the primary mode of fitness accumulation is additive, evolution favors ignoring environmental extremes and lineages become highly vulnerable to extinction if the frequency or scope of extreme weather events suddenly increases. Conversely, when fitness accumulates primarily multiplicatively, evolution favors bet-hedging phenotypes that cope well with historical extremes and are instead vulnerable to sudden increases in extreme event intensity. Our findings address a critical gap in our understanding of the potential consequences of rare selection events and provide a relatively simple rubric for assessing the vulnerabilities of any population of interest to changes in a wide variety of extreme environmental phenomena. adaptation; bet-hedging; climate change; evolutionary rescue; evolutionary simulation model; extreme weather events; life history;CLIMATE-CHANGE; EVOLUTION; REPRODUCTION; MAINTENANCE; DIVERSITY; PREDATION","Using hydrologic simulation to identify contributions of climate change and human activity to runoff changes in the Kuye river basin, China Under the background of global climate change and local anthropogenic stresses, runoff has been in decline in most river basins in China over the past decades. Assessing the relative effect of climate change and human activities is essential not only for understanding the mechanism of hydrological response in the catchment, but also for local water resources management. The Kuye river, the first-order tributary of the middle Yellow river, has experienced significant runoff declines. In this study, the characteristics of hydro-climatic changes of the Kuye river catchment were analyzed based on the observed data for the period 1955-2010. Using the monthly climatic and hydrological data, the Yellow river water balance model (YRWBM) is calibrated and verified to a baseline period from 1955 to 1978. Subsequently, natural runoff for human-induced period (1979-1998) and strongly human-induced period (1999-2010) is reconstructed using the YRWBM model without considering local human impacts. Results indicate that the time series of runoff was divided into three periods at two critical years of 1979 and 1998. The YRWBM model performed well in simulating monthly discharges in the catchment, both NSES in calibration and verification were above 70 %, while RES in both periods were at less than 5 %. The absolute runoff reductions induced by climate change and human activities both have been growing. The percentage of runoff reduction attributed to climate variations from 60.56 % in human-induced periods to 43.50 % in strongly human-induced periods. At the same time the percentage of runoff reduction from human activities is from 39.44 % in human-induced periods to 56.50 % in strongly human-induced periods. Thus human activities demonstrated a dominant influence upon runoff decline gradually.

Its value in climate change adaptation is widely accepted in developing countries because it can enable access to local knowledge and resources. Women in coastal Bangladesh are subject to exclusion from access to natural resources and are frequently unable to connect with outsiders because of socio-cultural and religious barriers leading to a lack of opportunity for interaction with linking actors. To explore changes in linking social capital for adaptation among women in the post-cyclone Aila-2009 context, a mixed method approach was employed in the villages of Gabura Union (Bangladesh). We argue that the social disruption caused by Aila allowed women to form links with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), contributing to local adaptive responses (e.g. in agricultural innovation and household handicrafts production). Our observations suggest that of the three commonly identified forms of social capital (i.e. bonding, bridging and linking), bonding relationships within the family appeared to become weaker after a major disaster, which may be attributed to the disruption of reciprocal kinship ties and greater mobility of male family members to search for new economic opportunities in cities. Over time, linking relationships with NGOs contributed to strengthening bonding and bridging among women through establishment of social networks for knowledge sharing and production. These altered relationships and enhancement of linking social capital have produced new adaptation strategies that persisted beyond the immediate post-cyclone recovery period.

While there is an increasing focus on the adaptive potential of migration, the health impacts of climate-related migration, including planned relocation and forced displacement, have not been thoroughly examined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that migration is currently, and will increasingly be, influenced by environmental degradation and climate change, and that it needs to be addressed in a focused and coordinated manner. Discussion: This paper examines the links between climate change, migration, and health, considering diverse migration responses, including immobility, forced displacement and planned migration, as well as the associated health risks and opportunities in different contexts. Using case studies, the paper illustrates strategies to reduce the health risks associated with climate change-related migration. Conclusion: While there is an increasing body of research examining the climate change-migration nexus, a dual approach is now required. This approach must include debate and further research regarding the health consequences and responses associated with climate migration as well as immediate strengthening of health systems to make them both climate resilient and migrant inclusive.

The construction of thousands of kilometres of canals resulted in over-drainage and targets for agricultural production failed. Abandoned, the area has been subject to severe forest and peat fires. Restoration of degraded peatlands normally starts with restoring the water table to rewet the surface in order to control fire and to initiate reforestation. Canal blocking strategies are a potential means for accomplishing this. In a test plot in the Northern part of Block C of the former Mega Rice Project (MRP), a series of dams were constructed and (ground)water tables and subsidence rates were monitored to assess the effects of dam construction on peatland hydrology. The resulting higher water tables did not completely compensate for the negative effects of increased subsidence near the canals. The canals, which are ""eating"" themselves into the peatland, create depressions in the peatland surface leading to interception of overland- and interflow and increased risk of overtopping of dams during extreme rainfall events. The lessons learned are being used to improve blocking strategies and dam design. The changes in peatland topography caused by drainage, however, need to be better understood in order to further refine strategies for hydrological restoration of degraded peatlands in Indonesia.
