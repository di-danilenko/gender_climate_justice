"1","Is industrialization still a viable development strategy for developing countries under climate change? The implications of climate change for economic development strategies in developing countries are explored, in particular whether industrialization still represents a viable development strategy in the context of climate change. Synthesizing the relevant literature and drawing insights from a comparison of Chinese and Indian experiences, it is argued that industrialization still represents an effective and, to some extent, indispensable development strategy, especially for those low- and low-middle-income countries that are affected by deindustrialization. climate change; deindustrialization; developing countries; development strategies; economic development; industrialization;GROWTH; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; POVERTY","Impact of sea level rise on tidal range in Chesapeake and Delaware Bays Coastal inundation is affected not only by rising mean sea level but also by changing tides. A numerical model is developed to investigate how sea level rise and coastline changes may impact tides in two coastal-plain estuaries, Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. Despite their different tidal characteristics, the two estuaries display similar responses to the sea level rise and shoreline management scenarios. When hypothetic sea walls are erected at the present coastline to prevent low-lying land from flooding, tidal range increases, with greater amplification in the upper part of the two estuaries. When low-lying land is allowed to become permanently inundated by higher sea level, however, tidal range in both estuaries decreases. Analyses of the tidal energy budget show that the increased dissipation over the shallow water and newly inundated areas compensates for the reduced dissipation in deep water, leading to smaller tidal range. The changes in the tidal range are not proportional to the changes in the mean sea level, indicating a nonlinear tidal response to sea level rise. The ratio of tidal range change to sea level rise varies between -0.05 and 0.1 in Chesapeake Bay and between -0.2 and 0.25 in Delaware Bay. The model results suggest a potential adaptation strategy that uses inundation over low-lying areas to reduce tidal range at up-estuary locations. Plain Language Summary Coastal inundation occurs when sea levels are higher than the normal extent of the tide. Presently, estimates of future coastal inundation due to sea level rise are made by simply adding the expected sea level rise to the present-day tides. However, tides are themselves affected by changes in water depth, thus sea level rise will change the position of high and low tide. In this study, we investigate how sea level rise will change tides in two large coastal waterways, Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. We also investigate how tides will be affected if shoreline protection measures are put in place to prevent rising sea levels from encroaching over low-lying land. We find that if no shoreline protection measures are installed, higher sea levels will reduce tides in both Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Adding shoreline protection measures however increases the tides, particularly in the upper reaches of both estuaries, where major cities are located. sea level rise; tides; coastal inundation; tidal dissipation;SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; TIDES; VARIABILITY; SIMULATION; ESTUARY; FLUXES; DISSIPATION; ASYMMETRY; COAST; EAST","Development of the Design code for Building Structures in China This paper gives an overview on the development and updated state of design code for building structures in China. The history of establishing and developing of a structural design code in China can be roughly divided into four phases: introducing and using foreign codes (1950-1969), creating the main Chinese structural design code (1970-1985), establishing advanced Chinese structural design code (1986-2000), and building an integrated standard system (2001- 2011). Four levels (technical law, basic code, commonly used code, and specific code) are set to build the standard system for the design of building structures, which included 42 applicable codes, 30 under drafting codes, and 12 planned codes. In accordance with the applicable range, all technical codes are divided into four grades namely national, trade, local, and enterprise standards. Against the general background of global warming and climate changes, globalization of economy, and the events of massive earthquake and disasters caused by wind and snow under extreme weather, a new round revision of design code for building structures has been initiated in China and most of them have been completed in the end of 2011. The principles of low carbon economy and emission reduction have been considered in the new version of the codes. The main contents and revision points were briefly introduced on code of unified standard, loads, concrete structures, and seismic design. standard system; building structures; global warming; low carbon economy; conceptual design;RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; TALL BUILDINGS; PROBABILITY; INTEGRATION","Effects of urban environmental conditions and landscape structure on taxonomic and functional groups of insects Insects are a particularly sensitive group to urbanization, and they are also highly dependent on structural, compositional, and environmental characteristics of the landscape as well as its scale. The identification of the landscape variables and scale which influence this group are necessary for the development of sustainable landscape planning in the face of climate change and environmental degradation. Here we aim to determine the most important spatial scale for the diversity of taxonomic and functional groups of insects, testing the hypothesis that the importance of environmental and landscape structure-composition variables on insect diversity and functional groups vary with the spatial scale. Finally, we selected the scale with the highest proportion of explained variance for the total, analyzing the correlations of landscape variables with each group. We collected insects in 15 non-overlapped landscapes, classifying them according to their order and functional groups. We generated 6 concentric circles from a focal patch per landscape, using remote sensing data to characterize landscape environmental and structural-composition variables from 200 to 1200 m. Finally, we tested the hypothesis by using the Variable Importance for the Projection and R-2 from Partial Least Square Regressions metrics. We identified that the importance of landscape diversity varied across the different scales. We found that 600 m was the scale with the highest explained variance for orders and functional groups in the total set. The scale at diversity of orders and functional groups reached the highest explained variance diversity that varied among groups. Parasitoids, predators, and phytophages responded to smaller scales, while pollinators and micophages to, and saproxylics to larger scales. Urban area and temperature were negatively associated with total diversity, while variables linked with vegetation quality presented a positive correlation. The generated results may contribute to improve the understanding of the urban ecology of insects, aiming to contribute with sustainable urban planning and conservation. nan;biodiversity; biodiversity management; diversity; functional; groups; insect; level; order; urban microclimate; urbanization","Global Disappearance of Tropical Mountain Glaciers: Observations, Causes, and Challenges This article reviews the current status of tropical glaciers in the South American Andes, East Africa, and Australasia by shedding light on past, present, and future glacier coverage in the tropics, the influence of global and regional climates on the tropical glaciers, the regional importance of these glaciers, and challenges of ongoing glacier recessions. While tropical glaciers have predominantly receded since the Little Ice Age, the rate of shrinkage has accelerated since the late 1970s as a result of climate changes. As a result, socio-ecological implications occur around ecosystem health, natural hazards, freshwater resources, agriculture, hydropower, mining, human and animal health, traditions and spirituality, and peace. tropical glaciers; climate change; glacier extinction; water resources; adaptation strategies;LA-PAZ BOLIVIA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CORDILLERA-BLANCA; ANDEAN GLACIERS; WATER-RESOURCES; SIERRA-NEVADA; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; DILUVIAL HISTORY; ENSO INFLUENCE; MASS-BALANCE","Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: Transparency and integrated assessment modeling Integrated assessment models (IAMs) connect trends in future socioeconomic and technological development with impacts on the environment, such as global climate change. They occupy a critical position at the global science-policy interface. IAMs and associated scenarios have come under intense scrutiny, with critiques addressing both methodological and substantive issues, such as land use, carbon dioxide removal and technology performance. Criticisms have also addressed the transparency of IAM methods and assumptions as well as the transparency of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment of IAMs. This paper, authored by the co-chairs of IPCC Working Group III and members of the Technical Support Unit, documents activities aiming to enhance the transparency of IAMs and their assessment. It includes a history of IPCC's approach to scenarios covering the formation of the Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) in 2007 and the emergence of the approach by which IPCC facilitates the development of scenarios, but does not produce them itself. An IPCC Expert Meeting at the start of the current assessment cycle made transparency recommendations targeted at both the research community and IPCC. The community has taken steps to ""open the black box"" by moving toward open-source and web-publishing IAM documentation. IPCC has included an Annex to its next report focusing on scenarios and modeling methodologies. An open call for scenario data linked to the current IPCC report includes an expanded set of input and output variables. This paper ends with suggested criteria for measuring the success of these efforts to improve transparency.

Air pollution not only causes morbidity, but nearly 3 million people per year die from unhealthy indoor air exposure. Furthermore, allergic rhinitis and air pollution interact. This report summarizes the discussion of an International Expert Consensus on the management of allergic rhinitis aggravated by air pollution. The report begins with a review of indoor and outdoor air pollutants followed by epidemiologic evidence showing the impact of air pollution and climate change on the upper airway and allergic rhinitis. Mechanisms, particularly oxidative stress, potentially explaining the interactions between air pollution and allergic rhinitis are discussed. Treatment for the management of allergic rhinitis aggravated by air pollution primarily involves treating allergic rhinitis by guidelines and reducing exposure to pollutants. Fexofenadine a non-sedating oral antihistamine improves AR symptoms aggravated by air pollution. However, more efficacy studies on other pharmacological therapy of coexisting AR and air pollution are currently lacking.

Methods The distributed lag non-linear model was employed to assess age (0-18, 19-39, 40-64, and 65 years and above), sex-cause-specific deaths, ERVs, and outpatient visits associated with extreme high (99(th) percentile) and low (5(th) percentile) temperatures and PM2.5 and O-3 concentrations at 90(th) percentile. Random-effects meta-analysis was adopted to investigate cause-specific pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the whole studied areas. Results Only the mortality risk of COPD in the elderly men was significantly associated with the extreme low temperatures. Exposure to the 90(th) percentile PM2.5 was associated with outpatient visits for asthma in 0-18 years old boys [RR = 1.15 (95% CI: 1.09-1.22)]. Meanwhile, significant elevation of ERVs of asthma for females aged 40-64 years was associated with exposure to ozone, with the highest RR of 1.21 (95% CI: 1.05-1.39).

This article examines the potential contribution that transition experiments can make to this process. Transition experiments can be understood as deliberate interventions that test novel configurations of social and technical elements that could lead to substantial low-carbon change. The analysis suggests that transition experiments can provide four primary benefits that might be leveraged to open low-carbon pathways for Canada: learning, capacity building, de-risking, and public education and engagement. ","Spatio-temporal distribution of sugarcane potential yields and yield gaps in Southern China The sustainability and production capacity of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum (L.)) in Southern China is essential to ensure sugar security in China, yet potential crop yield and yield gap (the difference between actual and potential crop yield) of sugarcane is poorly known. In this study, the sugarcane growth and development model, QCANE, was validated for sugarcane phenology, stalk height, and yields, then used to simulate potential yields and yield gaps of sugarcane in Southern Chine (SC) between 1970 and 2014. Simulated potential yields decreased as longitude and latitude increased, driven by spatial variation in solar radiation and maximum temperature. The gap between potential and water-limited yields was noticeably larger in Yunnan province because of the prevalence of seasonal water deficiency. However, nitrogen stress was the dominant driver of the yield gap, given the abundant precipitation in SC. Across SC, large variation in the yield gap between water-and-nitrogen limited yields and on-farm yields was observed for different counties, a difference that was usually larger than the local yield gap. Averaged across SC, on-farm sugarcane yields were only 27% of potential yields, 31% of water-limited yields, and 52% of nitrogen-limited yields. This result highlights considerable potential to significantly increase sugarcane production by improving varieties, government support, effective management measures such as fertilization, irrigation, and mechanization.

Study findings will aid the development of future MSWM systems in Harare. A1 and A2 considered the landfilling and incineration, respectively, of indiscriminately collected MSW with energy recovery and byproduct treatment. Source-separated biodegradables were anaerobically treated with the remaining non-biodegradable fraction being incinerated in A3 and landfilled in A4. A5 and A6 had the same processes as in A3 and A4, respectively, except the inclusion of the recovery of 20% of the recoverable materials. The life cycle stages considered were collection and transportation, materials recovery, anaerobic digestion, landfilling and incineration. A5 emerged as the best option. Materials recovery contributed to impact potential reductions across the four impact categories. Sensitivity analysis revealed that doubling materials recovery and increasing it to 28% under A5 resulted in zero eutrophication and acidification, respectively. Increasing material recovery to 24% and 26% under A6 leads to zero acidification and eutrophication, respectively. Zero global warming and human health impacts under A6 are realised at 6% and 9% materials recovery levels, respectively. municipal solid waste management; life cycle assessment; life cycle impacts; life cycle stages; eutrophication; global warming; human health; acidification; Harare; Zimbabwe;LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS; DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; LCA; SYSTEMS; ENERGY; INCINERATION; STRATEGIES; QUANTIFICATION","Activities of the Research Institute for Geo-Hydrological Protection, of the Italian National Research Council, World Centre of Excellence on landslide risk In this report, we summarise the activities of the Research Institute for Geo-Hydrological Protection (IRPI, http://www.irpi.cnr.it/en/), of the Italian National Research Council (CNR, http://www.cnr.it/en/), as a World Centre of Excellence (WCoE) on Landslide Risk, of the International Programme on Landslides (IPL, http://iplhq.org).

To reveal the nature of water resource issues under changing situations, the water resources system needs to be studied from a macro and systematic perspective. This report develops a water resources system into a water resources compound system that is constantly evolving under the combined action of the development, resistant, and coordination mechanisms. Additionally, the water quotient is defined as a quantitative representation of the sustainable development state of the water resources compound system. Four cities in China, Beijing, Fuzhou, Urumqi, and Lhasa, were selected as the study areas. The differences in the three types of mechanisms and the water quotient of the water resources compound system of each city in 2013 were compared. The results indicate that the different subsystems that comprise the compound system of a given area have different development mechanisms and resistant mechanisms. There are clear differences in the mechanisms and the water quotients for the water resources compound systems of different regions. Pertinent measures should be taken into account during integrated water resource management to improve the sustainable development status of regional water resources compound systems. water resources; compound system; water quotient; sustainable development; atmosphere system; mechanism;HAI RIVER-BASINS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL WATER; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; CRISIS; SUSTAINABILITY; SIMULATION; CONFLICT; YIELD","Influencing factors and their influencing mechanisms on urban resilience in China With an increase in disturbance in cities, improving urban resilience has become a global consensus in order to achieve sustainable urban development. As the largest developing country in the world, China must improve its urban resilience to withstand various threats during its rapid development. Therefore, it is critical to identify key influencing factors and their influencing mechanisms on urban resilience in China. To achieve this objective, this study identified 12 key influencing factors through literature review and Delphi method under a 4R (i.e., robustness, rapidity, redundancy, and resourcefulness) framework, and used the DEMATEL and ISM methods to investigate their influencing mechanisms. The results indicate that: 1) Policy system is the most important cause factor and resource allocation is the most important effect factor; 2) Factors of resourcefulness are fundamental factors influencing urban resilience. Factors of robustness and rapidity are direct factors influencing urban resilience; 3) There are five influencing paths of influencing factors among the 4R dimensions. Resourcefulness could directly influence robustness, redundancy and rapidity. Redundancy could directly influence robustness and rapidity. In the end, three implications are proposed, including improving the policy system, strengthening the assessment of urban resilience, and integrating resilience concept into the urban system.

The Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) aims to expand the coverage of well-connected PAs and other effective area-based conservation measures to 30% by 2030. We proposed a framework to evaluate the connectivity of PAs and developed strategies to maintain and improve the connectivity of PAs based on PA connectivity indicators, and we applied this framework to China's terrestrial PAs. We considered that the concept of PA connectivity is at the level of both PA patches and PA networks, including four aspects: intra-patch connectivity, inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA-landscape connectivity. We found that among China's 2153 terrestrial PA patches, only 427 had good intra-patch connectivity, and their total area accounted for 11.28% of China's land area. If inter-patch connectivity, network connectivity, and PA-landscape connectivity were taken as the criteria to evaluate PA connectivity, respectively, then the coverage of well-connected terrestrial PAs in China was only 4.07%, 8.30%, and 5.92%, respectively. Only seven PA patches have good connectivity of all four aspects, covering only 2.69% of China's land. The intra-patch, inter-patch, network, and PA-landscape connectivity of China's terrestrial PA network reached 93.41%, 35.40%, 58.43%, and 8.58%, respectively. These conclusions indicated that there is still a big gap between China's PA connectivity and the Post-2020 GBF target, which urgently needs to be improved. We identified PA patches and PA networks of ecological zones that need to improve PA connectivity and identified improvement priorities for them. We also identified priority areas for connectivity restoration in existing PAs, potential ecological corridors between PAs, and priority areas for PA expansion to improve the connectivity of PAs in China. Application of our framework elsewhere should help governments and policymakers reach ambitious biodiversity conservation goals at national and global scales. biodiversity conservation; connectivity; protected areas; dispersal probability; least-cost distance; ecological corridor;LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; HABITAT PATCHES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NETWORK ANALYSIS; IMPACT; CORRIDORS; INDEXES; TARGETS","CAN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT HELP ALASKA'S NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGERS RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE? Many legal scholars have called attention to the inability of stationary natural resource management laws to respond to a changing climate. There are various proposals for remedying these laws, including the use of adaptive management, through which resource managers can monitor changes and adjust policies accordingly. Yet there are practical and political challenges to implementing adaptive management. This article considers the extent to which adaptive management has been or could be implemented in response to Alaska's rapid climate change. Alaska is an important case study as it is warming far more quickly than many other parts of the globe, paving the way for species shifts and new commercial and industrial developments. The article is informed by interviews with twelve natural resource managers and researchers in Alaska as well as additional interviews with Alaskan agency representatives and community members. It concludes that adaptive management is occurring at small scales in Alaska and elsewhere, typically involving actions by lower-level managers in the context of permits or regulations that apply to a single species. These adaptive measures may not be labeled as ""adaptive management"" in agency regulations or even directly provided for in regulations, but they occur in spite of the many challenges to adaptive management. nan;CHANGE ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY","Numerical Study on Microclimate and Outdoor Thermal Comfort of Street Canyon Typology in Extremely Hot Weather-A Case Study of Busan, South Korea As cities are extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, they are fundamental in addressing these changes. However, streets, which are external spaces accessed by citizens in daily life, play an important role in improving the urban environment and public health. This study considered Busan in South Korea as a case study to investigate street canyons, including street canyon geometries and tree configurations, of old, present, and new city centers. The influence of morphological factors on the microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort was evaluated using the ENVI-met program for extremely hot weather. Changes in the street width, street orientation, and street canyon aspect ratio had a significantly higher impact on the microclimate and thermal comfort index (p < 0.01). These results indicated that the orientation of the main street should be consistent with the prevailing wind direction of Busan. Further, the shading of adjacent buildings improved the outdoor thermal comfort and reduced the significance of tree configuration in deeper street canyons. In addition, tree height had a more significant impact on street environment than other tree configuration factors, especially when the tree height increased from 9 m to 12 m. We recommended that the thermal comfort level can be improved by dynamically adjusting the relationship between the planting distance and tree height in streets having shallow street canyons. street canyon; orthogonal experimental design; microclimate; thermal comfort index; ENVI-met;URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; ENVI-MET; MITIGATION STRATEGIES; HONG-KONG; SIMULATION; IMPACT; TEMPERATURE; CITY; CLIMATE; MODEL","Selection and drift influence genetic differentiation of insular Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) on Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island Island populations have long been important for understanding the dynamics and mechanisms of evolution in natural systems. While genetic drift is often strong on islands due to founder events and population bottlenecks, the strength of selection can also be strong enough to counteract the effects of drift. Here, we used several analyses to identify the roles of genetic drift and selection on genetic differentiation and diversity of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) across eastern Canada, including the islands of Cape Breton and Newfoundland. Specifically, we assessed whether we could identify a genetic component to the observed morphological differentiation that has been reported across insular and mainland lynx. We used a dinucleotide repeat within the promoter region of a functional gene that has been linked to mammalian body size, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). We found high genetic differentiation at neutral molecular markers but convergence of allele frequencies at the IGF-1 locus. Thus, we showed that while genetic drift has influenced the observed genetic structure of lynx at neutral molecular markers, natural selection has also played a role in the observed patterns of genetic diversity at the IGF-1 locus of insular lynx. adaptation; Canada lynx; genetic drift; IGF-1; island rule; natural selection;EFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZE; BODY-SIZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RE-IMPLEMENTATION; F-ST; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION; RANGE; DIVERSITY; MAMMALS","Changing monsoon patterns, snow and glacial melt, its impacts and adaptation options in northern India: Synthesis This paper gives a synthesis of this special issue on the sensitivity to climate change of the main bio-physical processes in the Hindukush-Karakoram-Himalayas.

Then using copula function, the joint probability distribution of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration is built, and the conditional probabilities of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration are also presented. The results show that the first-order markov joint transition probability to rich-rich state and rich-poor state of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration is larger. The joint encounter frequency of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration in synchronous encounter situation is different with that in asynchronous encounter situation. The selected frank copula showing the joint probability distribution characteristics of rainfall and reference crop evapotranspiration is reasonable. When reference crop evapotranspiration is less than 1,865 mm, the sort of its conditional probability in different rainfall states is rich rainfall > normal rainfall > poor rainfall, which presents an opposite to the conditional probability of rainfall in different reference crop evapotranspiration states when rainfall is less than 1,105 mm.

However, almost all current Chinese policies are emphasizing the control of CO2 emissions only, and no goals have been established for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions, China risks missing early opportunities for lower-cost abatement of the latter. Aiming to disclose the different effects of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions and provide some suggestions for non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions reduction in China, this paper focuses on identifying the price impacts and transmitting paths among different sectors of imposing CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) emission taxes using the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) model, then further compares the sources of CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions based on the big data from the first national census of pollution sources. When the same emission tax is imposed for every ton of CO(2)e, the results clearly show that the prices in all sectors have the greatest increase for CO2 emissions tax scenario relative to CH4 and N2O emissions tax scenarios. With respect to sectors with larger CH4 and N2O emissions, price change in sectors with larger CO2 emissions will be responsible for the price change of almost all sectors. Moreover, from the perspective of sources of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions, CO2 emissions are from almost all industries of the entire economy, and CH4 and N2O emissions are from agriculture, energy mining, and waste. These results indicate that the tax reducing CH4 and N2O emissions will cause lower impacts than the abatement of CO2 emissions. Integrating the current national policies with the above results, Chinese government should also pay more attention to CH4 and N2O emission reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is a financially intensive operation requiring high start-up investment and involving operating costs that are dependent on weather conditions. Operational costs and the expansion of artificial snowmaking systems increase the price of ski passes. In our work, we analyzed the operations of a public company that operates the largest ski resorts in Serbia and directs the flow of winter sports tourism. We tried to determine, by means of correlation, the extent to which ski pass prices in the biggest winter resort in Serbia are influenced by factors such as natural snow cover, number of tourist overnights, ski run length, and local wages. The results of the survey indicate an increasing transformation of the ski resort into a thematic attraction independent of climatic factors in terms of determining ski pass prices. artificial snowmaking; correlation; ski pass; price; public; policy; Kopaonik;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SNOW PRODUCTION; SKI INDUSTRY; WEATHER; FUTURE; ADAPTATION; VARIABILITY; IMPACT; ANALOG; AREA","Development of Resilience Index Based on Flooding Damage in Urban Areas Flooding volume in urban areas is not linearly proportional to flooding damage because, in some areas, no flooding damage occurs until the flooding depth reaches a certain point, whereas flooding damage occurs in other areas whenever flooding occurs. Flooding damage is different from flooding volume because each subarea has different components. A resilience index for urban drainage systems was developed based on flooding damage. In this study, the resilience index based on flooding damage in urban areas was applied to the Sintaein basin in Jeongup, Korea. The target watershed was divided into five subareas according to the status of land use in each subarea. The damage functions between flooding volume and flooding damage were calculated by multi-dimensional flood damage analysis. The extent of flooding damage per minute was determined from the results of flooding volume per minute using damage functions. The values of the resilience index based on flooding damages were distributed from 0.797292 to 0.933741. The resilience index based on flooding damage suggested in this study can reflect changes in urban areas and can be used for the evaluation of flood control plans such as the installation, replacement, and rehabilitation of drainage facilities. flooding damage; resilience index; multi-dimensional flood damage analysis;CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; MANAGEMENT; DRAINAGE; CITIES","Out of the weeds?

We assembled a comprehensive occurrence database for 896 terrestrial invasive plant species from 33 regional collections of field and museum data and projected species ranges using MaxEnt species distribution models based on current (1950-2000 average) and future (2040-2060 average) climate. We quantified geographic invasion risk as differences in species richness, invasion debt, range inning, and identification of hotspots. Potential invasive plant richness was higher than observed richness, particularly in eastern temperate forests, where as many as 83% of species with suitable climate have not yet established. A small percentage (median = 0.22%) of species' potential ranges are currently occupied by them. With climate change, potential invasive plant richness declined by a median of 7.3% by 2050. About 80% of invasive plant hotspots were geographically stable with climate change, with the remaining 20% shifting northward. Invasion hotspots and current invasion debt reveal extensive, ongoing risk from existing invasive plants across the U.S., particularly in the Southeast. Climate change alters the spatial distributions of focal species for monitoring and is likely to reduce overall invasion risk in many areas. Early detection and rapid response programs could be most effective in stemming the spread of invasive plant species in areas with increased risk under climate change, while areas with persistent high risk are candidates for containment and control. The areas with reduced risk are prime locations for invasion of new imports from tropical and subtropical climates, highlighting the simultaneous need for prevention strategies.

Although conceptual approaches to tackle uncertainty seem diverse, a synthesis reveals more similarities than differences in the concepts published, especially if one adopts a model application-oriented focus. Given our findings, we slightly adapt the uncertainty framework table (UFT) developed by Walker et al. (2003) and apply it for an existing integrated modeling framework for the bio-economy. The use of color coded UFTs with a graphical visualization of uncertainty propagation pathways has facilitated a better overview and communication of uncertainties and uncertainty propagation pathways among the authors. Systematic consideration of uncertainties in integrated modeling may allow for more trust in model results and, if simulations are conducted, for a better robustness check of policy interventions.

However, the continent remains the most vulnerable continent to the effects of climate change. The agricultural sector in Africa is among the most vulnerable sectors to climate change. Also, as a dominant agricultural sector, African agriculture is increasingly contributing to climate change through GHG emissions. Research has so far focused on the effects of GHG emissions on the agricultural and other sectors with very little emphasis on monitoring and quantifying the spatial distribution of GHG emissions from agricultural land in Africa. This study develops a new index: African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI) that uses scores and specific scale ranges for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) to map the spatial variations in regional GHG emissions across Africa. The data for the three main GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N(2)0) were downloaded from FAOSTAT. The data were analyzed through the newly developed African Agricultural Land Greenhouse Gas Index (AALGGI). This is an empirical index with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher levels of emissions. The results show that Southern and North African regions have the lowest amounts of agricultural land GHG emissions, with AALGGIs of 3.5 and 4.5, respectively. East Africa records the highest levels of GHG emissions, with an AALGGI of 8 followed by West Africa with an AALGGI of 7.5. With the continental mean or baseline AALGGI being 5.8, East and Middle Africa are above the mean AALGGI. These results underscore the fact that though Africa, in general, is not a heavy emitter of GHGs, African agricultural lands are increasingly emitting more GHGs into the global GHG budget. The low AALGGIs in the more developed parts of Africa such as Southern and North Africa are explained by their domination in other GHG emitting sectors such as industrialization and energy. The high rates of emissions in East Africa and Middle Africa are mainly linked to intensive traditional farming practices/processes and deforestation. These findings underscore the need to further leverage climate change mitigation actions and policy in Africa and most importantly the co-benefits of mitigation and adaptations in the most vulnerable regions.

This paper undertakes the first investigation of the vulnerable group in the coal mine area, China and aims to clarify the influencing factors of local residents' environmental behavior. The differences of environmental behavior among different groups are divided by gender, age, educational level, proximity and household income using rank sum test. Furthermore, this paper discusses the effects of natural environment perception, social environment perception and environmental attitudes using the structural equation model. The results are as follow: most of the residents keep silent in the face of environmental pollution, and this is different from the Western environmental resistance behavior. No prior research has studied this silent group in the environmental behavior context. This study proves the heterogeneity in this association between socio-demographic and environmental behavior. Natural environment perception has a significant positive effect on environmental behavior. The environmental attitude has a significant negative effect on environmental behavior. Perception of the social environment has no significant effect on environmental behavior. The paper finally proposes that the government should consider these factors when it creates environmental policy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The term decision support describes a diverse class of resources designed to help manage this complexity and assist decision makers in understanding impacts and evaluating management options. Most climate-related decision support resources implicitly assume that decision making is primarily limited by the quantity and quality of available information. However, a wide variety of evidence suggests that institutional, political, and communication processes are also integral to organizational decision making. Decision support resources designed to address these processes are underrepresented in existing tools. These persistent biases in the design and delivery of decision support may under-mine efforts to move decision support from research to practice. The development of new approaches to decision support that consider a wider range of relevant issues is limited by the lack of information about the characteristics, context, and alternatives associated with climate-related decisions. We propose a new approach called a decision assessment and decision inventory that will provide systematic information describing the relevant attributes of climate-related decisions. This information can be used to improve the design of decision support resources, as well as to prioritize research and development investments. Application of this approach will help provide more effective decision support based on a balanced foundation of analytical tools, environmental data, and relevant information about decisions and decision makers.

This commentary builds upon the analytical distinctions of resilience provided by Urquiza et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001508.). In response to this article, we emphasize several distinctions between resilience and other systems concepts. These include distinctions between resilience, risk, and vulnerability, the tradeoff between resilience and efficiency, resilience contrasted with robustness, the relationship between resilience and sustainability, and finally methods for building resilience-by-design or resilience-by-intervention. Improving understanding of these concepts will enable planners to select resilience strategies that best support their system goals. We use examples from the 2020-2021 coronavirus pandemic to illustrate the concepts and the juxtapositions between them. Plain Language Summary This commentary builds upon the discussion of resilience in Urquiza et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001508). We discuss several distinctions related to resilience, both in urban contexts and the broader resilience literature. These include resilience versus risk and vulnerability, resilience versus efficiency, resilience versus robustness, and resilience versus sustainability. Finally, we contrast resilience-by-design with resilience-by 64 intervention. Understanding the differences between these concepts can help planners select strategies that best support their system goals.

However, for climate mitigation and adaption efforts, further studies are still needed to understand the regional consequences between the two global warming limits. Here we provide an assessment of changes in temperature extremes over China (relative to 1986-2005) at 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming levels (relative to 1861-1900) by using the 5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models under three RCP scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5). Results show that the increases in mean temperature and temperature extremes over China are greater than that in global mean temperature. With respect to 1986-2005, the temperature of hottest day (TXx) and coldest night (TNn) are projected to increase about 1/1.6 degrees C and 1.1/1.8 degrees C, whereas warm days (TX90p) and warm spell duration (WSDI) will increase about 7.5/13.8% and 15/30 d for the 1.5/2 degrees C global warming target, respectively. Under an additional 0.5 degrees C global warming, the projected increases of temperature in warmest day/night and coldest day/night are both more than 0.5 degrees C across almost the whole China. In Northwest China, Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, the projected changes are particularly sensitive to the additional 0.5 degrees C global warming, for example, multi-model mean increase in coldest day (TXn) and coldest night (TNn) will be about 2 times higher than a change of 0.5 degrees C global warming. Although the area-averaged changes in temperature extremes are very similar for different scenarios, spatial hotspot still exists, such as in Northwest China and North China, the increases in temperatures are apparently larger in RCP8.5 than that in RCP4.5. 1.5 degrees C global warming; 2 degrees C global warming; Temperature extremes; CMIP5; China;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCENARIO","Green finance: An empirical analysis of the Green Climate Fund portfolio structure While multilateral climate negotiations are at a deadlock, climate finance faces a crossroads as the lending community needs to develop renewed strategies on the 'Future of Environment Funds'. Most policy and scholarly attention have been directed on how to improve the largest multilateral climate fund - the Green Climate Fund (GCF) - own funding, compared to surprisingly few studies on the allocation strategies of the GCF funding. A conventional view so far has been of a Fund devoted mostly to finance non-bankable projects with public funding. Yet, improving the ability of the GCF to channelize both public and private sources of finance, and to contribute to de-risking more traditional sources of finance, would scale up climate finance and at the same time also improve the GCF own attractiveness for contributors. In this paper we empirically analyse the GCF portfolio structure and strategy and suggest the GCF can skillfully fund non-bankable parts of larger ""nearly bankable projects"". This supports a view of the GCF that departs from the conventional one.

We also determined for the land use sector 1) how much time is needed to plan the mitigation strategy, and 2) how much time is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? We used a bottom-up type model on emission mitigation named Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use Bottom-up model (AFOLU-B model) to consider a characteristics time sequence of actions, effects and costs of mitigation countermeasures. To input to the model, we developed future scenarios on human activities in these sectors based on data from Indonesian government. We found that i) evaluation on effects and costs of mitigation measures from a long-term viewpoint and their continuing implementation are required to increase future mitigation potentials under a limited budget. ii) a long-term reduction target will also play an important role for cost-effective countermeasure selection. iii) reforestation of slow glowing species and enhanced natural regeneration will cause great increase in mitigation potential in the country.

Therefore, Korea has devoted significant effort to the management of slope disasters. The Ministry of the Interior and Safety of Korea, which oversees the safety of the nation's people, has allocated a four-year budget of $557 million to investigate, assess, and maintain steep slope sites. However, there have been fatalities caused by steep slope site evaluations based on inadequate knowledge and a single retaining walls and embankments (RW&E) assessment table. Therefore, the assessment table for RW&E-type steep slopes needs to be improved in terms of its accuracy, simplicity, and ease of use. In this study, domestic and global evaluation methods were reviewed, problems associated with the existing RW&E assessment table were identified, and a focus group interview was conducted. The RW&E assessment table was improved through an indicator feasibility survey and analytic hierarchy processing. The improved assessment table was categorized from one to four classifications to reduce the ambiguity of the evaluation: concrete, reinforced soil-retaining walls, stone embankments, and gabions. This study will provide the sustainability of slope safety and serve as a reference for classification and evaluation criteria across all national institutions that conduct RW&E evaluations. disaster management; hazard assessment table; retaining wall; steep slope; analytical hierarchic process (AHP);nan","""Certain Uncertainty: The Role of Internal Climate Variability in Projections of Regional Climate Change and Risk Management"" Internal climate variability co-exists with anthropogenic climate change and places limits on the accuracy of regional climate projections due to its inherent unpredictability.

The goal is to determine the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of biofuels brought about by iLUC in a specific region. A regional approach can be based on the conditions specific to the respective region and the data for this region which, is contained in country statistics. This makes the results more resilient. It also appears that LUC is mainly caused locally or regionally. Relevant policy scenarios for different regions were calculated with a regional model. The calculations show reliable results. It is possible to introduce such a regional model in regulations for combating iLUC. The analysis of the policy options for combating iLUC shows that a regional approach would have a much more effective steering effect. biofuels; indirect land use change;nan","Evolutionary Climate-Change Modelling: A Multi-Agent Climate-Economic Model In climate-economic modelling, agent-based models are still an exception. Although numerous authors have discussed the usefulness of the approach, only a few models exist. The paper proposes an update to a multi-agent climate-economic model, namely the ""battle of perspectives"" (Janssen, 1996; Janssen and de Vries 1998). The approach of the paper is twofold. First, the reimplementation of the model follows the ""model to model"" concept. Supporters of the approach argue that replication is a useful way to check a model's accuracy and robustness. Second, updating a model with current data and new scientific evidence is a robustness check in itself. The long-term validity and usefulness of a model depends on the variability of the data on which it is based, as well as on the model's sensitivity to data changes. By offering this update, the paper contributes to the development of agent-based models in climate-economics. Acknowledging evolutionary processes in climate-policy represents a useful complement to intertemporal cost-benefit analyses, the latter of which derive optimal protection paths but are not able to explain why people do not follow them. Since the replication and update succeeded, the paper recommends using the model as a basis for further analysis. ","Landslide databases in the Geological Surveys of Europe Landslides are one of the most widespread geohazards in Europe, producing significant social and economic impacts. Rapid population growth in urban areas throughout many countries in Europe and extreme climatic scenarios can considerably increase landslide risk in the near future. Variability exists between European countries in both the statutory treatment of landslide risk and the use of official assessment guidelines. This suggests that a European Landslides Directive that provides a common legal framework for dealing with landslides is necessary. With this long-term goal in mind, this work analyzes the landslide databases from the Geological Surveys of Europe focusing on their interoperability and completeness. The same landslide classification could be used for the 849,543 landslide records from the Geological Surveys, from which 36% are slides, 10% are falls, 20% are flows, 11% are complex slides, and 24% either remain unclassified or correspond to another typology. Most of them are mapped with the same symbol at a scale of 1:25,000 or greater, providing the necessary information to elaborate European-scale susceptibility maps for each landslide type. A landslide density map was produced for the available records from the Geological Surveys (LANDEN map) showing, for the first time, 210,544 km(2) landslide-prone areas and 23,681 administrative areas where the Geological Surveys from Europe have recorded landslides. The comparison of this map with the European landslide susceptibility map (ELSUS 1000 v1) is successful for most of the territory (69.7%) showing certain variability between countries. This comparison also permitted the identification of 0.98 Mkm(2) (28.9%) of landslide-susceptible areas without records from the Geological Surveys, which have been used to evaluate the landslide database completeness. The estimated completeness of the landslide databases (LDBs) from the Geological Surveys is 17%, varying between 1 and 55%. This variability is due to the different landslide strategies adopted by each country. In some of them, landslide mapping is systematic; others only record damaging landslides, whereas in others, landslide maps are only available for certain regions or local areas. Moreover, in most of the countries, LDBs from the Geological Surveys co-exist with others owned by a variety of public institutions producing LDBs at variable scales and formats. Hence, a greater coordination effort should be made by all the institutions working in landslide mapping to increase data integration and harmonization.

This challenge may be addressed by: structuring the adaptation problem using a multiple perspective adaptation framework; and applying a context specific precedence grammar logic for selecting and evaluating adaptation measures. Precedence grammar logic is a set of rule based algorithms (grammar) that are based on the relationships in a local adaptation context. This paper demonstrates the application of a context specific precedence grammar logic in an adaptation context in Can Tho, Vietnam. Adaptation pathways comprising flood adaptation measures (i.e. dike heightening) for this case were generated using rule based algorithms based on the relationships between the drivers and the adaptation measures. The results show that complex adaptation issues that are structured, can be resolved using a context specific adaptation grammar approach. ","Determinants of smallholder farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies to climate change and variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia This study presents analysis of determinants of smallholder farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies to climate change and variability in the central highlands of Ethiopia. A distinction was made between coping and adaptation, as short-term responses to shocks and long-term responses to stressors, respectively. Binary logistic regression modeling was used based on a survey of 200 farmers. Socio-demographic, economic, biophysical, and institutional and infrastructural characteristics of the study setting and sample households were considered to identify key determinants of farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies. This is premised on the fact that understanding significant determinants of farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies is useful to design impactful adaptation interventions in the locality. The results showed that the significant factors affecting choice of adaptation strategies include perceived soil fertility status, perception of land tenure security, access to extension service, and ages of household heads. For the choice of coping options, agroecological zone, access to markets, farmer-to-farmer extension, landholding size, access to information on climate change, rainfall amount, and educational level of household heads were the significant determinants. Agroecological zone had negative influence to use selling livestock as coping strategy while the other variables had positive influences on farmers' choice of coping and adaptation strategies. Off-farm income, community participation, ownership of livestock and temperature on the other hand had no significant influence on the choice of coping and adaptation strategies to climate change. Adaptation planning for the study locality should take into account the potential influence of these determinant factors into account.

The results have shown that a turfgrid porous paving area of 72 m(2) could delay the start time of the runoff generated on it by up to 30 min when rainfall intensity is less than 3.88 mm/h. Although the retention of total suspended solids is only 13.86%, the grass-paved surface can effectively reduce and remove pollutants from the runoff, with the removal of ammonia and NO3--N being significant (at 39 and 76.55%, respectively). In addition, high reductions (>60%) in concentration were found for Zn, Cu, and Pb. However, it was found that pollutant concentrations in the infiltration water samples analysed are higher than in the runoff, which suggests the possible occurrence of pollution accumulation as an emerging pollution source. Furthermore, in 2015 no grass was observed in the pores of the pavement, which suggests that a poor maintenance strategy is in place; with this resulting in the development of a potentially high and concentrated source for pollutants.

In this context, the main objective of this research is to analyze the impacts of climate change on dairy cattle farms in terms of costs, according to different future scenarios and farms scales. Interviews were conducted with 140 dairy farmers in Thrace Region. To analyze the change in costs, the model developed by Calil et al. (2012) was used. According to the results of cost analysis, it was determined that climate change will lead to a 10-50% cost increase on dairy farms by the year 2044. The heat stress is responsible for 48-71% of the increase in the cost of production, where 24-52% is due to increase in feed prices. Based on the outcome of this research, it was suggested that agricultural extension activities should be carried out in order for farms to get adapted to climate change.

By revealing these obstacles and opportunities, theories of procedural justice can help to identify procedural reforms and political strategies that advance the interests of vulnerable populations. An account of procedural justice is proposed that foregrounds the capability for political control over one's environment, defined as having the political power to influence adaptation decisions. While the variables shaping this capability in the politics of environmental injustice often interact in ways that reproduce environmental inequities, adaptation politics has the potential to produce more transformational outcomes. To illustrate this potential, differences between the politics of environmental injustice and the politics of climate adaptation are drawn on to sketch the basic features of a typology of vulnerable populations' political capabilities in the politics of climate adaptation, before highlighting the potential points for intervention.

Heat waves are excessively hot periods during which the air temperatures of both urban and rural areas increase significantly. However, whether urban and rural temperatures respond in the same way to heat waves remains a critical unanswered question. In this study, a combination of observational and modeling analyses indicates synergies between urban heat islands and heat waves. That is, not only do heat waves increase the ambient temperatures, but they also intensify the difference between urban and rural temperatures. As a result, the added heat stress in cities will be even higher than the sum of the background urban heat island effect and the heat wave effect. Results presented here also attribute this added impact of heat waves on urban areas to the lack of surface moisture in urban areas and the low wind speed associated with heat waves. Given that heat waves are projected to become more frequent and that urban populations are substantially increasing, these findings underline the serious heat-related health risks facing urban residents in the twenty-first century. Adaptation and mitigation strategies will require joint efforts to reinvent the city, allowing for more green spaces and lesser disruption of the natural water cycle.

This paper suggests an objective function combining two competitive shortage indicators for multi-objective reservoir operation optimization. An improved genetic algorithm including a smoothing constraint, reducing infeasible fluctuations of the operation policy, is developed to solve this problem. Operating curves were optimized jointly to hedging factors aiming at avoiding severe droughts and high damages for users. The proposed function was compared with the conventional objective function of minimizing the sum of squared deviations (SSD) between releases and demands. Different combinations of weights of the objectives linked to the Moroccan reservoir were studied. The proposed objective function yields to improved results in terms of computation requirements since it converges quicker and it leads to better supply performance. For drinking water use, the frequency of shortage was reduced by 66% and the maximum deficit by 14% whereas for irrigation the frequency of shortage was curtailed by 6%. The operating curves obtained by the developed optimization model were then compared with static operating rule curves simulated in RIBASIM. The superiority of variable optimized rule curves was proven compared with stable operating mode over time.

The case of climate change adaptation in Austria Participation is usually regarded as a good practice in environmental policymaking, but its effects on policy strategies are unclear. Based on literature research, surveys, and interviews with participants, the present paper assesses whether decisional participation in formulating Austria's National Adaptation Strategy (NAS) was worth the effort. Assessed against the goals of the participation process, we find that it raised awareness for adaptation and facilitated an exchange among the participants and that it improved the content of the NAS. However, regarding the goal of enhancing the acceptance of and commitment to the NAS, we find that this has been achieved among those who participated but not among high-level policymakers who are responsible for implementing the NAS. We conclude that (decisional) participation has its benefits in formulating comprehensive policy strategies but that it is most likely not able to overhaul their well-documented weaknesses, among them weak political commitment and implementation failures.

We conducted a citywide investigation of urban greenery from the pedestrian perspective by developing a deep learning technique to extract greenery from fisheye images generated from Google Street View images in Hong Kong. Relying on open-source data, we compared pedestrian-level greenery measurements with the satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in diverse urban forms represented by local climate zone classes. Street greenery was spatially variant, and low greenery was found predominantly in private residential and commercial/business lands in high-density areas. Pedestrian-level measurement and the NDVI were strongly correlated, but the inconsistency between them increased from high-and mid-rise forms to low-rise forms and from compact forms to open forms. We also demonstrated the idea of integrating nearby street greenery with spatial information on population and urban morphology for inequality analysis.

The theory has been given too much credit, however. This article identifies and analyzes the troubling features of risk society, and demonstrates that it is a loose set of vague ideas, feelings, and hunches, rather than a theory. Risk society, as distinguished from modern industrial society, is a risk management society concerned with the identification and distribution of risks arising from industrial activities, while downplaying natural and other risks. Devoid of empirical content and analytical tools, it promotes a simplistic precautionary anti-industrial environmental and safety ethic. Risk society involves politicization of science and self-interested activism in risk management decision-making. Due to its unrealistic dogmas, ambitions, and side effects, risk society is unable to manage risks effectively and efficiently, and poses a threat to constitutional democracy. Policy-makers and risk managers, therefore, should not rely on risk society theory in designing and implementing risk management structures and regulations. risk society; risk policy; risk management; risk regulation; politicization of science; science in risk regulation; activism; politics of risk regulation;CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIOLOGY; POLITICS; THESIS","China's Comprehensive Disaster Reduction China is one of the countries in the world that are most affected by natural disasters. In recent years, with global climate change and rapid socioeconomic development in the country, natural disaster risks have been increasing and economic losses and the population affected have shown a growing trend; catastrophic disasters have repeatedly ravaged China, causing major socioeconomic impacts. The Chinese government attaches great importance to disaster prevention, reduction, and relief. Developments in laws and regulations on natural disaster management in the past three decades have provided an improved legal framework for disaster prevention, reduction, and relief. China's disaster relief is guided by the principle of people-centered, government-led, multilevel management, mutual support within social networks, and self-rescue of victims. Through the years, the government has been expanding the scope of disaster relief and increasing the level of assistance, strengthening integrated coordination mechanisms, and standardizing procedures for relief work. Disaster prevention, reduction, and relief mechanisms based on China's situation, and with Chinese characteristics, have been established. Attention has also been given to capacity-building. Much effort has been made to implement disaster reduction projects and to improve early warning systems, emergency response, science and technological support, human resource development, and community disaster relief systems. Future disaster reduction efforts of the Chinese government will focus on alleviating the impact of natural disasters, coping with catastrophic disaster risks, harmonizing the relationship between humans and nature, and attaining sustainable development.

Climate mitigation needs to be led by both global strategies and national mandates in an integrated way, but climate change impacts are manifested locally and adaptive capacity is determined by local conditions. The article first lays out the basic components of local capacity for decentralized policy making and assesses the current local capacity in view of Japan's climate policy. The bulk of data employed in the study is derived from existing up-to-date government databases. It found that only the largest municipalities as well as prefectures have governing capacities to develop a comprehensive approach to climate adaptation, while medium-sized municipalities have a potential to take a participatory approach to climate policy. It argues that some pioneering localities realize their potentials to take initiatives under political leadership but most localities act in a piecemeal fashion according to clear national-level guidance on climate change.

Arg plantations contribute to the reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide by fixing carbon through photosynthesis and storing it in the tree components (leaves, branches, stems, barks and roots) and by their transformation to stabilized forms of soil organic matter. The objective of this study was to determine the stored carbon in the whole aboveground biomass in 5, 9, 15, 25, 32 and 51-year-old plantations, through a forest inventory and the use of allometric equations in Tabasco, Mexico. The stored carbon was determined using linear regression and mean values were analyzed by the Tukey test (p < 0.05) with the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) program. Results indicated that the carbon concentration varies with age; in 51-year-old plantation the stored carbon in stem was 192.32 Mg ha(-1), in branches was 64.75 Mg ha(-1) and in the whole tree was 257.07 Mg ha(-1), while 5-year plantations had values of 16.65, 9.63 y 26.28 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The results indicated that H. brasiliensis plantations can be considered a potential source of mitigation of climate change. carbon sequestration; allometric equations; forest inventory; forest plantations; environmental services;AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS; SEQUESTRATION; FOREST","The sugarless grape trait characterised by single berry phenotyping In grape production, the selection of varieties well-adapted to climate fluctuations, especially warming, is based on achieving a balance between fruit sugars and acidity. In recent decades, temperature has been constantly rising during ripening causing excessive sugar concentrations and insufficient acidity in wine grapes in the warmest regions. There is thus an increasing interest in breeding new cultivars able to ripen at lower sugar concentration while preserving fruit acidity. However, the phenotyping of berry composition challenges both methodological and conceptual issues. Indeed, most authors predetermine either average harvest date, ripening duration, thermal time or even the hexoses concentration threshold itself to compare accessions at a hopefully similar ripe stage. In this study, we phenotyped the fruit development and composition of 6 genotypes, including 3 new disease-tolerant varieties known to produce wines with low alcoholic contents. The study was performed at single berry level from the end of the green growth stage to the end of phloem unloading, when water and solute contents reach a maximum per berry. The results confirm that sugarless genotypes achieve fruit ripening with 20-30 % less hexoses than the classical varieties, Grenache N and Merlot N, without impacting berry growth, total acidity or cation accumulation. The sugarless genotypes displayed a higher malic acid/tartaric acid balance than the other genotypes, but similar sucrose/H+ exchanges at the onset of ripening. Data suggest that the sugarless phenotype results from a specific plasticity in the relationship between growth and the turgor imposed by organic acid accumulation and sugar loading. This opens interesting perspectives for the understanding of the mechanism of grapevine berry growth and for breeding varieties that will cope better with climate warming.

There is, therefore, a great need within emerging global assessment programs, such as the IPBES and other international efforts, to develop functioning mechanisms for legitimate, transparent, and constructive ways of creating synergies across knowledge systems. We present the multiple evidence base (MEB) as an approach that proposes parallels whereby indigenous, local and scientific knowledge systems are viewed to generate different manifestations of knowledge, which can generate new insights and innovations through complementarities. MEB emphasizes that evaluation of knowledge occurs primarily within rather than across knowledge systems. MEB on a particular issue creates an enriched picture of understanding, for triangulation and joint assessment of knowledge, and a starting point for further knowledge generation.

As a central agenda-setting actor in the EU, we argue that understanding the institutional capacity for CPI inside the European Commission is especially important for understanding the advancement of CPI in the EU overall. We focus on the inner workings of the Commission, and we ask: what role does the leadership style of the Commission President play in advancing institutional capacity for implementing CPI? We assess the institutional capacity for CPI in the Commission during the Barroso and Juncker Presidencies, which display characteristics of bottom-up and top-down leadership styles, respectively. While we do not find that one presidential leadership style is necessarily 'better' than the other at enhancing institutional capacities for CPI, we highlight important differences along four key factors, namely: (1) political commitment to overarching climate objectives and to the necessity of implementing CPI; (2) recognition of functional overlaps between policy objectives and compatible beliefs for implementing CPI among policymakers; (3) an opportunity structure for innovative policy development and policy entrepreneurship; (4) and meaningful coordination and consultation mechanisms.

This study addresses this pressing research gap by drawing on the capitals framework and empirical data from small-scale coastal fisheries in the Western Region of Ghana. It employs an ethnographic approach, based on multiple sources of evidence including documents, interviews and participant observation to examine mechanisms of mobilising adaptive capacity in response to climate and non-climate stressors. Our findings suggest that responding to stressors involves mobilising sets of main-available capitals, such as local innovation, ability to improvise, new technologies, corrupt practices and belief systems (cultural capital); collective action, networks and social ties (social capital); and complaints to the government (political capital). These capitals were the main constituents of adaptive capacity, particularly considering non-responsive government and formal organisations. Further, other forms of capitals, i.e., local leadership, local knowledge, learning capacity, and training (human capital); networks, collective actions, associations and bonding ties (social capital); sand (natural capital); funds from fishing (financial capital), combine in complex ways to mobilise such available capitals. This understanding is critical if synergies among main-available and supporting-available capitals are to support building and mobilizing adaptive capacity. Further, it may help guide important decisions, proactive plans and strategic investment for developing key capitals to enhance adaptive capacity.

We proposed that two capacities will be essential to transformation: the capacity to navigate emergence and cross-scale systems reflexivity. We outline our efforts to design and deliver a Global Fellowship program in social innovation, intended to strengthen these two capacities among practitioners already engaged in socially innovative work. Results indicated that the concepts, frameworks, and experiences introduced through the Fellowship led to four key insights about these capacities. Firstly, individual Fellows and their organizations were able to see some complex system dynamics that were previously invisible, which in turn, allowed Fellows to see the distribution of resources and agency across the system in new ways. Secondly, engaging with diversity is essential in social innovation and transformative change processes, and system reflexivity aided in doing this. Additionally, Fellows indicated they were able to identify different kinds of opportunities and the generative potential that can lie within social-ecological systems. Lastly, the findings demonstrate the challenging nature of crossing scales and how a transformative space, such as a Fellowship, helps to practice the experience of contestation, unpredictability, and the uncontrollable dynamics of transformation and social innovation. complex systems; emergence; Fellowship; institutional work; resilience; social innovation; systems change; systems entrepreneurship; systems reflexivity; transformations to sustainability; transformative capacities; transformative spaces;SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; INSTITUTIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP; ROCKEFELLER-FOUNDATION; ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GOVERNANCE; SCALE; ADAPTATION; DIVERSITY","Trend analysis of seasonal rainfall and temperature pattern in Kalahandi, Bolangir and Koraput districts of Odisha, India Climate variability, particularly that of the annual air temperature and rainfall, has received a great deal of attention worldwide. The magnitude of the variability or fluctuations of the factors varies according to locations. Hence, examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, the present study examines long-term changes and short-term fluctuations in monsoonal rainfall and temperature over Kalahandi, Bolangir and Koraput (hereafter KBK) districts in the state of Odisha. Both rainfall and temperature data for period of 1980-2017 were analyzed in this study. Statistical trend analysis techniques namely Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were used to examine and analyze the problems. The detailed analysis of the data for 37 years indicate that the annual maximum temperature and annual minimum temperature have shown an increasing trend, whereas the monsoon's maximum and minimum temperatures have shown a decreasing trend. Statistically significant trends are detected for rainfall and also the result is statistically significant at 99% confidence limit during the period of 1980-2017. Rainfall is showing a quite good increasing trend (Sen's slope = 4.034) for JJAS season. In the case of maximum temperature for the observed period, it showed a slight warming or increasing trend (Sen's slope = 0.29) while the minimum temperature trend showed a cooling trend (Sen's slope = -0.006) but result of maximum temperature trend analysis is statistically significant at 95% confidence limit, on the contrary, the trend analysis result of minimum temperature is not statistically significant. climate variability; Mann-Kendall's test; Sen's slope estimator; trend analysis;TEMPORAL TRENDS; RIVER-BASIN; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; CONNECTION; MINIMUM; MAXIMUM","Personality and environmental outcomes: The role of moral anger in channeling climate change action and pro-environmental behavior The overarching aim of the present research is to investigate whether and how HEXACO personality traits relate to climate change action, pro-environmental behavior, and moral anger. A sample of 268 community participants provided responses for measures of the HEXACO model, moral anger, intention to engage in climate change action, and pro-environmental behavior. Hierarchical tests indicated that (1) Openness to Experience outperformed the other HEXACO personality traits in predicting climate change action, whereas (2) both Openness to Experience and Honesty-Humility outperformed the other HEXACO personality traits in predicting pro-environmental behavior, controlling for participants' gender, age, education, and employment status. Specifically, mediation analyses showed that (3) Openness to Experience was related to climate change action both directly and indirectly via moral anger. Furthermore, (4) Openness to Experience and Honesty-Humility were independently related to pro-environmental behavior both directly and indirectly via moral anger. nan;RISK PERCEPTIONS; MODEL; EMOTIONS; PRIDE; GUILT; RESPONSIBILITY; DETERMINANTS; ASSOCIATIONS; METAANALYSIS; PSYCHOLOGY","Conceptual design and preliminary analysis of a hybrid wind-nuclear power system for on-demand power supply China prioritizes clean energy for power generation in response to climate change and air pollution. By the end of 2021, the installed capacity of wind power has reached 328.48 GW, accounting for 13.8% of China's total installed capacity of 2376.92 GW. However, wind power is inherently unstable and its output depends on resources, which poses challenges for the national grid. Wind curtailment is often encountered when electricity production is plentiful. The main objective of this work is to develop a clean energy generation system for on-demand power supply to improve the utilization of wind resources. The LBE reactor is also a clean energy source with flexible power regulation that helps mitigate the impact of wind variability. Therefore, a hybrid wind-nuclear power system (HWNPS) is proposed. This paper demonstrates the technical feasibility of the LBE reactor and conducts a preliminary analysis of the economics of the HWNPS. The additional cost of HWNPS due to power regulation is about $ 9.04/MWh, which has potential for research and development.

We hypothesized that meetings involving the FDA Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee might serve as a barometer for the impact of FDAAA on drug safety regulatory decision making. Research Design: We conducted a case study analysis of 42 DSaRM advisory committee meetings held between 2002 and 2011. Publicly available sources (FDA meeting minutes and materials, safety alerts, and drug manufacturer Web sites) were reviewed to describe and compare DSaRM meeting frequency, content and outcomes between the pre-FDAAA (2002-2007) and post-FDAAA (2008-2011) periods. Results: DSaRM meeting frequency increased after FDAAA (from 2.7 to 6.5 meetings per year). DSaRM meetings were more likely to be held jointly with other drug advisory committees after FDAAA (from 68% to 92% of meetings). DSaRM members were invited participants in 35 additional meetings of other drug advisory committees (2007-2011). DSaRM meetings were more likely to review issues of approvability (eg, new drugs, new indications, and new product formulations) after FDAAA. FDA questions to the committee were more likely to request an explicit drug safety assessment after FDAAA (from 31% to 76% of meetings). Content analysis of meeting outcomes and subsequent FDA regulatory decisions did not suggest a more or less risk aversive climate after FDAAA. Conclusions: Increased DSaRM advisory committee activity indicates its advice was being sought more broadly for drug regulatory decision making and at earlier stages of drug development after FDAAA was enacted. pharmaceutical policy; drug safety; risk assessment; regulation;nan","Human-induced regulations of river channels and implications for hydrological alterations in the Pearl River Delta, China Sound understanding of hydrological alterations and the underlying causes means too much for the water resource management in the Pearl River Delta. Incision of river channels plays the key role in the hydrological alterations. As for the causes behind the river channel incision, sand dredging within the river network of the Pearl River Delta is usually assumed to play the overwhelming role in changes of geometric shapes of the river channels. Based on thorough analysis of well-collected data of channel geometry, streamflow, sediment load and water level, this study exposes new findings, investigating possible underlying causes behind the changes of the geometric shapes of the river channels at the Sanshui and Makou station. The results of this study indicate: (1) different changing properties of the geometric shapes are identified at the Sanshui and Makou stations. Larger magnitude of changes can be found in the river channel geometry of the cross section at the Sanshui station when compared to that at the Makou station. Lower water level due to fast riverbed downcutting at the Sanshui station than that at the Makou station is the major reason why the reallocation of streamflow occurred and hence the hydrological alterations over the Pearl River Delta; (2) depletion of sediment load as a result of construction of water reservoirs in the middle and upper Pearl River basin, sand dredging mainly in the Pearl River Delta and heavy floods all contribute much to the incision or deposition of the riverbed. Regulations of erosion and siltation process of the river channel often alleviate the incision of the river channels after a relatively long time span, and which makes it even harder to differentiate the factors causing the river channel incision; (3) the intensifying urbanization in the lower Pearl River basin greatly alters the underlying surface properties, which has the potential to shorten the recession of the flood event and may cause serious scouring processes and this role of flash floods in the incision of the river channels can not be ignored. This study is of great scientific and practical merits in improving human understanding of regulations of river channels and associated consequences with respect to hydrological alterations and water resource management, particularly in the economically booming region of China.

Assessing whether continued global change will lead to further regime shifts, or has the potential to trigger cascading regime shifts has been a central question in global change policy. Addressing this issue has, however, been hampered by the focus of regime shift research on specific cases and types of regime shifts. To systematically assess the global risk of regime shifts we conducted a comparative analysis of 25 generic types of regime shifts across marine, terrestrial and polar systems; identifying their drivers, and impacts on ecosystem services. Our results show that the drivers of regime shifts are diverse and co-occur strongly, which suggests that continued global change can be expected to synchronously increase the risk of multiple regime shifts. Furthermore, many regime shift drivers are related to climate change and food production, whose links to the continued expansion of human activities makes them difficult to limit. Because many regime shifts can amplify the drivers of other regime shifts, continued global change can also be expected to increase the risk of cascading regime shifts. Nevertheless, the variety of scales at which regime shift drivers operate provides opportunities for reducing the risk of many types of regime shifts by addressing local or regional drivers, even in the absence of rapid reduction of global drivers. nan;SAFE OPERATING SPACE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DYNAMICS; SAVANNA; COLLAPSE; ECOLOGY; MODELS; FOREST; FIRE","Projection of Rice and Maize Productions in Northern Thailand under Climate Change Scenario RCP8.5 Climate change has an effect human living in a variety of ways, such as health and food security. This study presents a prediction of crop yields and production risks during the years 2020-2029 in northern Thailand using the coupling of a 1 km resolution regional climate model, which is downscaled using a conservative remapping method, and the Decision Support System for the Transfer of Agrotechnology (DSSAT) modeling system. The accuracy of the climate and agricultural model was appropriate compared with the observations, with an Index of Agreement (IOA) in the range of 0.65-0.89. The results reveal the negative effects of climate change on rice and maize production in northern Thailand. We show that, in northern Thailand, rainfed rice and maize production may be reduced by 5% for rice and 4% for maize. Moreover, rice and maize production risk analysis showed that maize production is at a high risk of low production, while rice production is at a low risk. Additional irrigation, crop diversification, the selection of appropriate planting dates and methods of conservation are promising adaptation strategies in northern Thailand that may improve crop production. future rice production; future maize production; climate change; agriculture; Thailand;nan","Reef-associated ichthyofauna from a marginal coral reef habitat along the west coast of India: Implication for management strategies Coral reefs harbour remarkable high biodiversity. Reef fishes are among the most important communities in the coral reef ecosystem, significantly contributing to ecosystem functioning and reef resilience. However, under the continuous effect of climate change and human activities, corals and reef fishes are in peril. For the first time, we documented coral reef-associated ichthyofauna from Malvan marine sanctuary (MMS) on the central west coast of India, an understudied marginal patch coral reef habitat. Experiencing severe stress due to concurrent coral bleaching, fishing, sedimentation, intensifying tourism, and coastal development activities. We reported the occurrence of 47 species of reef fishes belonging to 35 genera and 26 families from the MMS, also a list of hard corals from in the MMS, thus highlighting the biodiversity of reef building corals and reef fishes in the MMS. The coral habitat in the MMS is experiencing severe stress due to concurrent thermal coral bleaching, fishing, sedimentation, intensifying tourism, and coastal development activities.. Therefore, urgent intervention with sustainable fishery management policies and long-term reef protection measures is a prerequisite for the persistence of the corals and the associated reef fishes in the MMS.

The results indicate that, after controlling for the main determinants in the growth model, the climate change with various proxies has a significantly negative impact on provinces' economic growth in the region. In particular, local institutions not only increase economic growth, but also reduce the negative impact of climate change on economic growth as well.

In order to estimate future PMPs, the hydro-meteorological method is applied. The key future meteorological variable used to analyze the rate of change of future PMPs is the dew-point temperature. Future 12-h persistence 100-year return period extreme dew-point temperatures obtained from future daily dew-point temperature time series by using the scale-invariance method are applied to estimate future PMPs. As a result of estimating future PMPs using several RCMs and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) scenarios, the spatial distribution of future PMPs is expected to be similar to that of the present, but PMPs tend to increase in the future. In addition, it can be seen that the difference in PMPs estimated from various RCMs and RCP scenarios is getting bigger in the future. Especially after 2070, the difference has increased even more. In the short term, it is proposed to establish climate change adaptation policies with an 18% increase in PMPs, which is the ensemble average in the future year 2050. climate change; ensemble; probable maximum precipitation; RCM; scale-invariance;PMP","Rhetorical Citizenship and the Science of Science Communication Public policy decisions often require rhetorically-engaged citizens to have some understanding of the science and technology involved. On many current issues (GMO crops, vaccinations, climate change) sectors of the public hold views differing from those of most scientists, and they often do not support proposals based on the scientists' views. The overall cultural authority of science has also been challenged in the last decade by several negative trends in the sciences themselves, including widely-reported cases of fraud and failures in replication. With the support of professional science organizations, science communication specialists have stepped in aggressively to address science's communication problems scientifically. This paper will examine the assumptions behind their advice on scientific information, their recommended strategies of framing, narration, and projecting trustworthiness, and their characterizations of audiences and the nature of science itself. From the perspective of rhetorical argumentation, the science communication literature does not promote addressing audiences as citizens capable of rational argumentation.

Unpredictable climate change places plants under a variety of abiotic stresses. Studying the regulation of stress-responsive genes can help to understand plants' ability to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. Changes in epigenetic marks such as histone modifications and DNA methylation are known to regulate gene expression by their dynamic variation in response to stimuli. This can then affect their phenotypic plasticity, which helps with the adaptation of plants to adverse conditions. Epigenetic marks may also provide a mechanistic basis for stress memory, which enables plants to respond more effectively and efficiently to recurring stress and prepare offspring for potential future stresses. Studying epigenetic changes in addition to genetic factors is important to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying plant stress responses.

Les phenomenes climatiques extremes, tels que les secheresses, risquent de devenir plus frequents. Ces phenomenes sont mis en evidence dans les projections medianes du changement climatique etablies pour le bassin de Murray-Darling, en Australie. Pour comprendre les repercussions du changement climatique sur le rendement des cultures irriguees, il faut disposer d'une representation explicite des changements spatiaux qui touchent les stocks naturels (c.-a-d. l'approvisionnement en eau) et de leur variabilite temporelle (c.-a-d. les etats de la nature de la frequence de la secheresse) et assurer une gestion active des stocks de capital grace a des strategies d'attenuation et d'adaptation selon l'etat de la nature.

Possible impacts of natural and anthropogenic stresses on surface water reservoirs volume and groundwater storage have been assessed through water supply scenario analysis. Besides, contrary to other surface water hydrological models, the unique nature of WEAP adds water demand assessment by simulating Addis Ababa city near future water demand coverage under three population projection scenarios. The water demand projections of Addis Ababa city indicates 100% water demand coverage will not be achieved for high (4.6%), medium (3.8%) and low (2.8%) population growth rate projections, even with all the emerging and planned water supply projects starting production up until 2025. Supply scenario projections indicate, as surface water reservoirs are highly sensitive to climate change and variability, the city groundwater supply sources will be noticeably affected by the emerging and planned groundwater supply expansion schemes. If groundwater abstraction continues to reach to zero unmet demand, more than 30 meter groundwater level decline can be registered in 2025. To foresee the combined effect of both natural and anthropogenic stresses on Addis Ababa city water supply sources, best case (considering conditions which improve Addis Ababa city water supply) and worst case (considering conditions stressing Addis Ababa city water supply) scenarios were tested. The best case scenario results in zero unmet water demand in Addis Ababa city in most wet months of future projection years up to 2025, with likely decline of about 6 meter on the groundwater level. The worst case scenario shows that Addis Ababa city water demand coverage will potentially be reduced to a maximum of 35% in 2025, with seasonal and annual variability. The dynamic link between surface water reservoirs and groundwater supply sources helps to gain insight into the potential consequences of continuously changing natural and anthropogenic conditions on Addis Ababa city water supply sources. Consequently, the significant predicted near future pressure on Addis Ababa city surface water and groundwater supply clearly indicate that planning and developing alternative water supply sources outside of the boundary (Upper Awash basin) where the city is located should be immediately started in order to endure the pressure from the ever increasing demand. Otherwise, not only Addis Ababa will continue suffering unmet water demand for the years to come, but also the water supply sources will be severely impacted. Nonetheless, wherever the water supply sources, minimizing water loss, waste water recycling and improving water use efficiency should be given at most priority.

Seed transfer from southern to northern Japan is prohibited in Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora). To evaluate the current regulation of seed transfer, a reciprocal transplant trial was conducted in P. densiflora trees originating from two provenances in southern (S) and northern (N) Japan and planted in sites S and N near these provenances. We observed survival rate at 0-15 years old before a thinning and at 15-30 and 1540 years old after the thinning and measured diameter, per-planted-area cross-sectional area, and shape of stems of 30-year-old trees. The survival rate before the thinning was lower in provenance S than in provenance N and in site S than in site N. The survival rates after the thinning were lower in non-home sites, in particular, provenance S in site N. The stem diameter was largest in provenance S in site S, smallest in the both provenances in site N, and intermediate in provenance N in site S. Thus, trees were fewer and larger in provenance S than in provenance N in their home sites. As a result, the per-planted-area stem cross-sectional area of 30-year-old trees was smallest in provenance S in site N, suggesting a disadvantage of north-ward transplantation.

The academic literature, however, pays little attention to the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategies of these households. Based on the survey data of 327 rural households in the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquake-stricken areas in the Sichuan Province, the livelihood pressure, adaptability, and livelihood strategy characteristics of rural households were analyzed, and the disordered multi-classification logistic regression model was constructed to explore the correlation between the above-mentioned variables. The results show that: (1) Rural households face the greatest economic pressure and the least social pressure; rural households have the strongest adaptability in social capital and the lowest adaptability in financial capital. The proportion of rural households that chose the aid livelihood strategy was the highest, while the proportion of rural households that chose the adjustment livelihood strategy was the lowest. (2) Compared with the expanded livelihood strategy, (a) When the health pressure is higher, the rural households are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy, followed by the contractive livelihood strategy and, finally, the aid livelihood strategies; (b), the higher the physical capital, the more often the rural households tend to choose the expanded livelihood strategy compared to the adjustment livelihood strategy; (c), The higher the financial capital of farm households, the more they prefer contractive livelihood strategies compared to the expanded livelihood strategy and (d), compared with the aid livelihood strategy, rural households with greater economic pressure are more inclined to choose the expanded livelihood strategy.This study can provide a reference for the establishment of relevant policies related to the adaptation capacity of rural households in the earthquake hazard zone. livelihood pressure; livelihood adaptability; livelihood strategies; earthquake disaster areas; Sichuan;CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; DISASTER-PREPAREDNESS; RISK PERCEPTION; LAND TRANSFER; SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOOD; POVERTY VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; FOOD PRODUCTIVITY; MOUNTAINOUS AREAS; FARM HOUSEHOLDS","Climate change adaptation mainstreaming in the planning instruments of two South African local municipalities This article reflects on the role of urban planning in climate change adaptation and the role of planning instruments in facilitating the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation. An analytical framework is introduced to analyse primary spatial and integrated planning instruments in the City of Cape Town and Thulamela Local Municipality in South Africa, as comparative cases with core similarities and contextual differences. The findings are discussed in terms of where adaptation should be included throughout the planning process and the extent to which the cases have been able to mainstream climate change adaptation within their planning instruments. The findings show that local municipal plans and policies are recognising the impact of climate change on settlements and the role of planning in responding to these impacts. However, there is little evidence of addressing these long-term impacts through programmatic and coherent approaches using short- to medium-term planning instruments.

Unlike the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement does not enshrine differentiated substantive mitigation obligations for developed and developing countries. However, an increasingly proceduralized variant of the CBDR principle, which facilitates regard for the interests of developing countries with respect to treaty implementation yet does not guarantee favourable substantive outcomes for these states, is evident in the emerging regime. The experience of the International Maritime Organization's climate change regime provides a cautionary tale with respect to procedurally oriented differentiation that is not reinforced by effective processes to ensure that developed states honour their finance and technology transfer commitments. Accordingly, this article posits that strong accountability mechanisms are required to transform opportunities for procedural differentiation in the Paris Agreement into a robust framework for procedural regard for the interests of developing states.

Therefore, drought index is critical in drought monitoring practice. However, the standing drought indices include no information about agricultural irrigation. In this case, based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Self-Calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (sc-PDSI), here we proposed the Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index (MPDSI) by considering agricultural irrigation such as irrigation quotas and soil water deficits. We compared changes of droughts monitored by MPDSI and other drought indices considered in this study, and found that MPDSI can well monitor drought conditions in irrigated regions. In this sense, MPDSI can monitor the actual drought conditions under human influences such as irrigation. Besides, we also found that MPDSI can well lessen overestimation of drought conditions by PDSI in terms of drought duration and drought intensity. Therefore, we can conclude that MPDSI can be accepted in drought monitoring practice across China. It should be noted here that the idea behind development of MPDSI and also the MDPSI proposed in this study can be well referenced in drought monitoring in other regions of the globe.

Innovative and effective responses to climate change require that we move beyond reliance on government to include organisations spanning different sectors, such as not-for-profit, private, and community groups. Interactions among these organisations in collaborative networksor forumsmay provide important mechanisms to successfully address climate change impacts. This paper investigates the relationships between organisational participation and involvement in forums and responses to climate change. Survey data show that people from many organisations are participating in forums and using these meeting points to discuss climate change, even when forums are intended to serve other purposes. The data suggest that participation in any type of forum is related to organisational responses to climate change. Attributes such as type of organisation and knowledge of climate change issues were also found to be related to organisational responses to climate change but these became less important when climate change was discussed in forums. The results of the research suggest that a practical way to increase the volume and variety of organisational responses to climate change may be to encourage participation in forums and/or to influence existing networks to incorporate more discussions of climate change issues. climate change; organisations; governance; collaboration; forums; climate action;MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; MULTISECTOR NETWORKS; SMALL BUSINESSES; ADAPTATION; CITIES; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; MITIGATION; TYPOLOGY; CAPACITY; POLITICS","Quantitative assessment of the contributions of climate change and human activities on global grassland degradation Grassland degradation received considerable concern because of its adverse impact on agronomic productivity and its capacity to provide goods and service. Climate change and human activities are commonly recognized as the two broad underlying drivers that lead to grassland degradation. In this study, a comprehensive method based on net primary productivity (NPP) was introduced to assess quantitatively the relative roles of climate change and human perturbations on worldwide grassland degradation from 2000 to 2010. The results revealed that at a global scale, 49.25 % of grassland ecosystems experienced degradation. Nearly 5 % of these grasslands experienced strong to extreme significant degradation. Climate change was the dominant cause that resulted in 45.51 % of degradation compared with 32.53 % caused by human activities. On the contrary, 39.40 % of grassland restoration was induced by human interferences, and 30.6 % was driven by climate change. The largest area of degradation and restoration both occurred in Asia. NPP losses ranged between 1.40 Tg C year(-1) (in North America) and 13.61 Tg C year(-1) (in Oceania) because of grassland degradation. Maximum NPP increase caused by restoration was 17.57 Tg C year(-1) (in North America). Minimum NPP was estimated at 1.59 Tg C year(-1) (in Europe). The roles of climate change and human activities on degradation and restoration were not consistent at continental level. Grassland ecosystems in the southern hemisphere were more vulnerable and sensitive to climate change. Therefore, climate change issues should be gradually integrated into future policies and plans for domestic grassland management and administration.

One conventional way to achieve gender balance is to introduce gender quotas. Here we show that gender quotas make interventions more effective and lead to more equal sharing of intervention benefits. We conducted a randomized 'lab'-in-the-field experiment in which 440 forest users from Indonesia, Peru and Tanzania made decisions about extraction and conservation in a forest common. We randomly assigned a gender quota to half of the participating groups, requiring that at least 50% of group members were women. Groups with the gender quota conserved more trees as a response to a 'payment for ecosystem services' intervention and shared the payment more equally. We attribute this effect to the gender composition of the group, not the presence of female leaders. nan;WOMENS PARTICIPATION; COMMUNITY FORESTRY; ELITE CAPTURE; USER GROUPS; REPRESENTATION; AFRICA; DETERMINANTS; INCENTIVES; PAYMENTS; FAIRNESS","Energy rationalization for an educational building in Egypt: Towards a zero energy building Buildings have been consuming energy and resources at an ever-increasing rate worldwide. Given the rising living standard, population growth and global warming, energy saving techniques have been recently adopted in the framework of high performance buildings, also known as near zero-energy buildings. This is particularly true for Egypt since over the past decade, the energy consumption has witnessed an unprecedented increase particularly for the buildings sector whose share in the electricity consumption can reach 66%-74%. Hence, it is timely for Egypt to upgrade its building construction code by mandating energy rationalization. This work investigates the effects of applying energy rationalization for a non-residential building in Egypt. As a case study, the Mechanical Engineering Department building at the Faculty of Engineering Campus of Ain Shams University, was modelled using EnergyPlus as a typical educational building. A number of retrofitting strategies and energy saving techniques have been assessed and compared to reach an optimized building envelope with minimum energy needs (energy rationalization). Retrofitting the building walls resulted in a significant contribution to the energy saving (>20%). Combining various building envelope retrofitting strategies dropped the building energy consumption by more than (>36%). Furthermore, using energy efficient measures by upgrading the mechanical HVAC systems used to condition the retrofitted building led to energy savings of more than 50% and a drop in the system capacity by more than 65%. Subsequently, a solar PV system is sized to cover these rationalized energy needs with a payback period of 4-5 years, thus transforming the sample building with annual energy use intensity (EUI) of - 230 kWh/m(2) into a near zero-energy building with an EUI of -106 kWh/m(2).

The successful development of the CDM since it started in December 2003 is documented. The CDM pipeline includes calculation of the investment in the CDM projects. The total investment in the 2171 registered CDM projects is approximately US$60 billion. It is shown that programmatic CDM gives hope for an increased share of projects in Africa, since 16% of the programmatic CDM projects are hosted by African countries compared with 2.5% for normal CDM projects. One aspect that is normally forgotten in the critique of CDM is that there are large indirect benefits of the CDM: a large increase in the awareness of the importance of making GHG reduction activities in the developing countries after the CDM capacity building activities have been performed compared with before the CDM started. nan;nan","Discussion of ""Assessments of Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Runoff with SWAT for the Huifa River Basin, Northeast China"" by Aijing Zhang; Chi Zhang; Guobin Fu; Bende Wang; Zhenxin Bao; and Hongxing Zheng Zhang et al. (Water Resour Manag doi:10.1007/s11269-012-0182-2, 2012) studied the impacts of climate change and human activities on the runoff for the Huifa River basin. They employed a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), which was calibrated for the baseline period 1956-1964, and then used to reconstruct the natural runoff for the climate change period 1965-2000. Results showed that both climate change and human activities decrease the observed runoff. Climate change impacts on annual runoff were -37.7, -59.5, +36.9, and -45.2 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995, and 1996-2005 respectively, compared with the baseline period 1956-1964. Human activities decreased runoff and caused a relatively larger magnitude impact than those of climate change after 1985. Human activities decreased the annual runoff by -32.9, -46.8, -67.8, and -54.9 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995, and 1996-2005 respectively. Human activities further decreased runoff in wet years due to regulation and storage of water projects.

We examined the effects of land-use (forest vs. annual cropland) and soil depth (0-10 vs. 10-30 cm) on the quality (availability of C for decomposition), structural stability (composition of C functional groups), and thermal stability (energy yield and temperature characteristics during thermal oxidation) of SOC in a hedgerow system in central Alberta, using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis methods. The SOC quality (proportion of O-alkyl C) was higher, while the proportion of H- and C-substituted aromatic C and structural stability (hydrophobicity index (HB/HI), aromaticity index (ARM), and alkyl index (A/OA)) were all lower in the forest than in the cropland. The SOC also had lower thermal stability (higher energy density and lower temperature at which 50% of the mass was lost (TG-T50)) in the forest than in the cropland. Between the two soil depths, SOC quality (proportion of N-alkyl C, O-alkyl C and di-O-alkyl C) was higher, but the proportion of H- and C-substituted aromatic C and structural and thermal stabilities were lower, within the surficial 0-10 cm layer than in the 10-30 cm soil. We conclude that while the forest land-use within the hedgerow system had a higher SOC quality, it had lower SOC structural and thermal stabilities, suggesting that SOC under the forest land-use may be more susceptible to decline under climate change or other forms of anthropogenic disturbance.

Here, we evaluate the global food security including the global farming system as well as the global food trade, reserve and loss systems from 1961 to 2019, and analyze their temporal and spatial characteristics by using the global food vulnerability (GFV) model. The spatio-temporal patterns of the vulnerability of the global food system were consistent with the GFSI. As food production and consumption vary greatly in different countries which have continued for a long time, food exports from many developed agricultural countries have compensated for food shortages in most countries (about 120 net grain-importing countries). As a result, many countries have relied heavily on food imports to maintain their domestic food supplies, ultimately causing the global food trade stability to have an increasing impact on the food security of most countries. The impact of global food trade on global food security increased from 9% to 17% during 1961-2019, which has increased the vulnerability of the global food system. The food damage in the United States, Russia, China, and India has varied significantly, and global cereal stocks have fluctuated even more since 2000. From 1961 to 2019, the food system security of some Nordic countries significantly improved, while the food system security of most African countries significantly deteriorated. Most countries with high food insecurity are located in Africa and South Asia. In order to cope with extreme events, these countries need to strengthen and improve their own food production and storage systems, which will help the World Food and Agriculture Organization to formulate relevant food policies and maintain sustainable development.

We tested this model using the dental phenotype of modern and ancient common voles (Microtus arvalis), introduced onto the Orkney archipelago (Scotland) from continental Europe some 5000 years ago. First, we investigated phenotypic divergence of Orkney and continental European populations and assessed climatic influences. Second, phenotypic differentiation among Orkney populations was tested against geography, time, and neutral genetic patterns. Finally, we examined evolutionary change along a time series for the Orkney Mainland. Molar gigantism and anterior-lobe hypertrophy evolved rapidly in Orkney voles following introduction, without any transitional forms detected. Founder events and adaptation appear to explain this initial rapid evolution. Idiosyncrasy in dental features among different island populations of Orkney voles is also likely the result of local founder events following Neolithic translocation around the archipelago. However, against our initial expectations, a second marked phenotypic shift occurred between the 4th and 12th centuries AD, associated with increased pastoral farming and introduction of competitors (mice and rats) and terrestrial predators (foxes and cats). These results indicate that human agency can generate a more complex pattern of morphological evolution than might be expected in island rodents.

The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm soil depth, continued over 20 years. Our experiments, on three soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157 years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65% of cases, SOC increases occurred at > 7 parts per thousand per year in the 0-23 cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4 parts per thousand per year in the 0-40 cm depth. In the two longest running experiments (>150 years), annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35 t fresh material per hectare (equivalent to approx. 3.2 t organic C/ha/year) gave SOC increases of 18 parts per thousand and 43 parts per thousand per year in the 23 cm depth during the first 20 years. Increases exceeding 7 parts per thousand per year continued for 40-60 years. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3 parts per thousand-8 parts per thousand per year over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19 parts per thousand per year over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the ""4 per 1000"" goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (1) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (2) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (3) practices uneconomic for farmers-potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (4) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield. 4 per 1000; carbon sequestration; climate change mitigation; long-term experiments; management practices; organic amendments; Rothamsted; soil organic carbon;BROADBALK WHEAT EXPERIMENT; GREENHOUSE-GAS MITIGATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE MITIGATION; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; PART 1; SEQUESTRATION; MANAGEMENT; FERTILIZER; NITROGEN; MATTER","No change from climate change: vulnerability and small island developing states Climate change is frequently touted as the biggest development challenge that faces humanity. Such rhetoric may be distracting from other development challenges which need to be addressed simultaneously with climate change. This paper uses the case study of small island developing states (SIDS) affected by climate change to explore how focusing on climate change can depoliticise the challenges that they face. Three linked points of depoliticisation through climate change are exemplified: emphasising the hazard, avoiding other long-term development challenges, and shifting focus away from opportunities for reducing vulnerability, including during community reconstruction. Examples cover scientific and policy discussions, from inside and external to SIDS. Links are made with migration narratives, especially learning from the past and the importance of not rebuilding communities with the same vulnerabilities as before. The fundamental challenge is not so much addressing the hazard of climate change per se, but why SIDS peoples often do not have the resources or options to address climate change and other development challenges themselves. In this regard, climate change brings little that is new to SIDS which continue to be marginalised. climate change; small island developing states; SIDS; migration; vulnerability;PACIFIC AMBASSADORS; MIRAB MODEL; ENVIRONMENT; MALDIVES; REFUGEES; KIRIBATI; REALITY; REGIME","Assessing and mapping ecosystem services to support urban green infrastructure: The case of Barcelona, Spain The ecosystem services approach provides an efficient way to support urban green infrastructure planning. Such an assessment, together with mapping, can effectively produce spatial analyses on a specific scale, helping to maintain multi-functional landscapes and plan urban green infrastructure. In turn, green infrastructure can offer a wide variety of ecosystem services, promoting landscape sustainability. This study develops a methodology for the planning of urban green infrastructure based on an ecosystem services approach that assesses the supply capacity of ecosystem services, and identifies possible spatial characteristic areas for interlinking urban green infrastructure within the study area. More specifically, from a landscape perspective, we use 32 ecosystem services (as X-axis) and different land use types (as Y-axis) to build an ecosystem service assessment matrix. We then take the municipality of Barcelona as an example, using the latter to assess and map ecosystem services within the city through ArcGIS, which shows the spatial distribution characteristics of ecosystem services provision. We identify possible spatial areas - which include ecosystem services provision, barren, and obstructed areas - by overlapping the ecosystem services assessment maps. Ultimately, the results provide a reference for urban green infrastructure planning by recognizing priority protected areas, new construction areas, potential areas, and renewal areas.

Wealthy countries spend increasing amounts of aid to support adaptation to climate change in developing countries and have committed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to prioritize adaptation aid to those ""particularly vulnerable"" to climate change. While research has started to track this aid, it has not yet examined its allocation across all donor and recipient countries. We thus do not know to what extent vulnerable countries indeed receive more support for adaptation. We address this research gap and ask: how does this commitment to prioritizing particularly vulnerable countries translate into actual adaptation aid allocation? To what extent do vulnerable countries receive more adaptation aid? We address these questions though a quantitative analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on bilateral adaptation aid from 2011 through 2014. In contrast to other studies, we find that vulnerability-or more precisely, vulnerability indicators-matter for adaptation aid allocation. Countries that are more exposed to climate change risks, such as extreme weather events or sea level rise, receive more adaptation aid, both on a per capita basis and as a percentage of all adaptation aid. These results indicate that collectively (even if not at the level of each individual donor) donors align their bilateral adaptation aid allocation with global promises. ","Usable, but unused: A critical story of co-producing the UK?s Climate Change Risk Assessments Non-use of climate information is often attributed to scientists failing to understand what decision-makers need. In response, co-production offers one promising method to improve the usability, and therein, use of climate information. Yet it remains unclear to what extent usability and use are linked, or if other factors influence the non-use of climate information. This paper critically examines two efforts to co-produce climate information for UK adaptation decision-making: the first and second cycles of the climate change risk assessment to gather evidence and then inform the national adaptation programme. To do this, a mixed methods approach was used: (i) textual analysis of official Government documents, and (ii) in-depth interviews with key actors. Our research found that the institutional-political context in which climate information is produced and used, played a sig-nificant role in defining who the user should be, how the data analysis was performed, and the extent to which that information was used. Just because something is co-produced does not mean it will be usable, nor does something that's usable automatically mean it will be used. Unless new research seeks to better understand how the modes of production (linear vs. co-production) influence the use of climate information, who uses it, and how it's used, questions will remain over whether the right barriers to climate inaction have been tackled.

The aim of mitigating climate change is realized in many parts of the transport system, concurrently and at high pace, which brings with it many challenges for the resilience of the system. By resilience, we mean the ability of a system to adapt due to disruptions and surprises. There are numerous links between the different systems that form the transport system and the actors responsible for available choices in the system of systems need to be identified. The aim of this paper is to identify requirements for developing a method for increasing resilience in the transport system. In this study a description of the electrified goods transport system as a system of systems is developed through a combination of researchers from different areas and discussions with experts mainly in the field of transport and governance. The resulting system of systems is presented in the paper together with a list of measures that will aid the development of a resilient electrified goods transport system.

We constructed a system dynamics model for a cocoa agroforest landscape in southwestern Ghana to explore whether REDD payments are likely to promote forest conservation and what socio-economic implications would be. Scenarios were constructed for business as usual (cocoa production at the expense of forest), for payments for avoided deforestation of old-growth forest only and for payments for avoided deforestation of all forests, including degraded forest. The results indicate that in the short term, REDD is likely to be preferred by farmers when the policy focuses on payments that halt the destruction of old-growth forests only. However, there is the risk that REDD contracts may be abandoned in the short term. The likeliness of farmers to opt for REDD is much lower when also avoiding deforestation of degraded forest since this land is needed for the expansion of cocoa production. Given that it is mainly the wealthier households that control the remaining forest outside the reserves, REDD payments may increase community differentiation, with negative consequences for REDD policies.

Although Indigenous communities and their knowledge systems are recognized as critical resources for understanding and adapting to climate change, no comprehensive, evidence-based analysis has been conducted into how environmental studies engage Indigenous communities. Here we provide the first global systematic review of levels of Indigenous community participation and decision-making in all stages of the research process (initiation, design, implementation, analysis, dissemination) in climate field studies that access Indigenous knowledge. We develop indicators for assessing responsible community engagement in research practice and identify patterns in levels of Indigenous community engagement. We find that the vast majority of climate studies (87%) practice an extractive model in which outside researchers use Indigenous knowledge systems with minimal participation or decision-making authority from communities who hold them. Few studies report on outputs that directly serve Indigenous communities, ethical guidelines for research practice, or providing Indigenous community access to findings. Further, studies initiated with (in mutual agreement between outside researchers and Indigenous communities) and by Indigenous community members report significantly more indicators for responsible community engagement when accessing Indigenous knowledges than studies initiated by outside researchers alone. This global assessment provides an evidence base to inform our understanding of broader social impacts related to research design and concludes with a series of guiding questions and methods to support responsible research practice with Indigenous and local communities. indigenous knowledge systems; climate research; community-based participatory research; indigenous research methods; research ethics; traditional ecological knowledge; transdisciplinary research;TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE; PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; EVIDENCE-BASE; ADAPTATION; CONSERVATION; SCIENCE; VULNERABILITY; EXPERIENCE; REVIEWS","Effects on Net Irrigation Water Requirement of Joint Distribution of Precipitation and Reference Evapotranspiration To establish the uncertain influence that the joint distribution of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration has on net irrigation water requirement, a Copula function-Monte Carlo method (CFMC) was proposed to calculate the probability of irrigation water requirement. Taking the Jingdian Irrigation District in Northwest China as an example, the distribution laws of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration were studied. Furthermore, five typical years under different crop planting structure conditions were selected, and the variation characteristics of net irrigation water requirement in each typical year under the conditions of climate uncertainty were analyzed. The results revealed the optimal distribution functions of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration to be gamma distribution and lognormal distribution. The probability density map of the joint distribution of precipitation and reference evapotranspiration has a ""saddle"" shape; that is, irrigation water requirement and reference evapotranspiration are usually inversely related. As the probability of the irrigation water requirement increases, the net irrigation water requirement in the irrigation area also increases. The CFMC method can determine the design value of the net irrigation water requirement under a specific probability for typical years under different crop planting structure conditions, which can provide a reference for agricultural water resource allocation in irrigation areas. irrigation water requirement; precipitation; reference evapotranspiration; copula function; uncertainty;RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; PAN EVAPORATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FAO-CROPWAT; RAINFALL; MODEL; DISTRICT; KERALA; WHEAT","A district level assessment of vulnerability of Indian agriculture to climate change Assessing vulnerability to climate change and variability is an important first step in evolving appropriate adaptation strategies to changing climate. Such an analysis also helps in targeting adaptation investments, specific to more vulnerable regions. Adopting the definition of vulnerability given by IPCC, vulnerability was assessed for 572 rural districts of India. Thirty eight indicators reflecting sensitivity, adaptive capacity and exposure were chosen to construct the composite vulnerability index. Climate projections of the PRECIS model for A1B scenario for the period 2021-2050 were considered to capture the future climate. The data on these indicators were normalized based on the nature of relationship. They were then combined into three indices for sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity, which were then averaged with weights given by experts, to obtain the relative vulnerability index. Based on the index, all the districts were divided into five categories with equal number of districts. One more district was added to 'very high' and 'high' categories. The analysis showed that districts with higher levels of vulnerability are located in the western and peninsular India. It is also observed that the highly fertile Indo-Gangetic Plains are relatively more sensitive, but less vulnerable because of higher adaptive capacity and lower exposure.

Thus, female turtle nesting behaviour can influence the sex, fitness and emergence behaviour of their hatchlings. We studied nest-site selection and nest depth in 333 natural loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests from a nesting population in Cabo Verde. Nest site and depth varied among females and among different nests from the same female. However, female body size only explained a very small part of the variability of nest depth. Nest incubation temperature also varied as a function of depth. To test the influence of nest depth on incubation and embryonic development, 90 loggerhead nests were incubated in standard conditions and at different depths (35, 40, 45, 50 and 55cm) in a beach hatchery and monitored until hatching. Deeper nests had greater emergence success and lower temperature, and hatched later, affecting hatchling sex ratio. Incubation at 35cm can lead to 89.4-97.7% females, whereas incubation at 50cm would produce around 62.4-64.9% females. Survival in nests at 35cm was lower than at deeper nests. Female turtles that dig deeper nests may have more vigorous offspring, exhibiting faster locomotor abilities. Nest depth did not influence emergence behaviour. However, clutch size enhanced synchrony at emergence, resulting in a higher number of hatchlings emerging simultaneously in smaller nests. Depth at which nests are re-buried should be considered a key factor for the success on nest relocation programmes. Females could reduce the impact of climate warming on embryonic development by nesting at deeper locations. sea turtles; nesting behaviour; global warming; survival; sex ratio; Cabo Verde;CHELONIA-MYDAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INCUBATION-TEMPERATURE; ASYNCHRONOUS EMERGENCE; CAPE-VERDE; POPULATION; PATTERNS; HATCHERY; ISLAND; SAND","Increased maritime traffic in the Arctic: Implications for governance of Arctic sea routes Climate change is producing maritime navigation opportunities in the Arctic. Melting sea ice in the summer months is increasing shipping and other vessel traffic. A well-developed body of literature investigates the viability of the two main shipping routes: the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage (NWP). This article explores the impact increased maritime traffic will have on the governance of these routes. Despite lying within the Arctic region, each route has its own geophysical, legal, and political features that will shape the character of its governance regime. The NSR lies within Russia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although international reconciliation on the level of authority that Russia should have over the NSR is preferable, the route's future political viability is not at risk as much as the NWP's. Russia has long exerted, and will continue to exert, control over the NSR in accordance with its established governance system and in the name of environmental stewardship. In contrast, the legal status of the NWP in the Canadian archipelago, currently debated, will continue to be important to resolve as traffic increases. The viability of the NWP rests on international agreement, particularly since the entire route passes through the EEZs of multiple countries - the United States, Canada, and the Kingdom of Denmark. Russia exerts authority over NSR traffic regardless of legal and political contentions, while Canada does not exercise a similar level of control over the NWP due to the ongoing conflict over the legal status of the route.

Yitpi and cv. Janz) was grown under field conditions in the Australian Grains Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (AGFACE) facility. Ambient [CO2] (a[CO2], similar to 384 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated [CO2] (e[CO2], similar to 550 mu mol mol(-1)) were combined with two soil water levels (rain-fed and irrigated) and two times of sowing (TOS) in three consecutive years to provide six environments (2007-TOS1, 2007-TOS2, 2008-TOS1, 2008-TOS2, 2009-TOS1, 2009-TOS2). Grain samples were assessed for a range of physical, nutritional and dough rheological properties. The effect of e[CO2] on thousand grain weight (TGW) was significantly different in each growing environment: TGW was significantly increased under e[CO2] only at 2007-TOS2 (by 5%), 2009-TOS1 (by 5%) and 2009-TOS2 (by 15%) but not significantly changed under other conditions. The magnitude of reduction of grain protein concentration at e[CO2] differed among the growing environments but was highly correlated with the percentage yield stimulation under e[CO2] (r(2) = 0.91) suggesting that grain protein concentration under e[CO2] was diluted by increased yield. Across all treatments, grain nutrient concentration was significantly reduced by e[CO2] for Fe (3.9%, 6.2%), Cu (2.2%, 3.4%), Zn (5.9%, 5.7%), Ca (5.6%, 7.3%), Mg (5.6%, 5.8%), Na (21.2%, 30.4%), S (4.4%, 4.4%), P (4.1%, 3.2%) in cv. Yitpi and Janz, respectively. Effects of e[CO2] on grain Zn, Mg and Na concentrations were dependent on the growing environment. Relative reduction of grain S, Fe, Mg, Zn, P at e[CO2] were significantly correlated with grain yield stimulation at e[CO2]. Reductions of these nutrients under e[CO2] were not fully explained by biomass dilution as the relationships differed for each nutrient. Under e[CO2], flour yield of cv. Janz was increased but that of cv. Yitpi was not changed. Even though grain protein concentrations of both cultivars were similar at e[CO2], bread volume as inferred indirectly by dough rheology parameters was 12% greater for cv. Janz (185 +/- 5 cm(3)) than cv. Yitpi (162 +/- 4 cm(3)) at e[CO2]. This disparity may be related to the compositional changes in wheat flour protein at e[CO2], suggesting that future breeding and adaptation strategies to improve the grain quality under e[CO2] should consider the prevailing hydro-thermal conditions.

It is also used in industries for locating and zoning the hazardous areas inside the premises as per the level of hazards. Hazard maps are used mainly for land management, hazard identification, geological surveys for insurance rate adjustments and hazard mitigation. In concern with its industrial and urban planning, hazard mapping is done by all the authority and workers to identify hazard at a particular place, and thus, they learn to develop maps for every hazardous location for identifying and mitigating potential hazards with special emphasis on economic and social parameter. This work is perhaps an attempt to catalogue all the hazardous map systems and techniques for developing hazardous maps associated with sustainable urban planning and industrial development, and suggestions to use hazardous maps for sustainable development have also been touched upon.

The purpose was to identify key risk areas and risk-free areas from the point of view of human security and activity on the floodplains, based on the examples of the vicinities of Wroclaw and Raciborz in the Odra Valley, Poland. Due to recent climate change, Poland has suffered the effects of severe flooding (e.g., 1997, 2001, 2010). The analyses conducted were motivated by the European Parliament and Council's recently implemented Directive 2007/60/WE, as well as by the demand for studies for local spatial planning. The analysis indicates that reasonably developed areas do not account for the majority of those studied, making up 36% of the Wroclaw area and 15% of the Raciborz area.

Flowering is controlled by different factors including genetic regulation and environmental conditions. In the Mediterranean area, favourable conditions usually occur in spring, when most plant species flower including those of the Mediterranean Ouercus genus. This paper reveals and analyses an unusual and lesser-known phenomenon occurring in the two main Mediterranean agroforestry ecosystems of South Europe, the Mediterranean forest and ""dehesa"", that is, a second flowering occurring in autumn for the species Ouercus ilex subsp. ballota (holm oak). The continuous pollen monitoring of the atmosphere in the city of Cordoba (southern Spain) for 25 years, together with field phenological observations in the area, has indicated that, apart from the main pollination period in spring, secondary flowerings also occasionally occur in this area, specifically in autumn. The present work examines these uncommon pollination events detected in the autumns of certain years with the aim of determining the main environmental factors that influence and control them. During the 25-year study period, there were 7 years in which a secondary Ouercus flowering was detected in the area from the second half of October until the end of November. The univariate statistical analysis of the influence of environmental variables determined that the meteorological conditions in September were the most influential. Low mean temperatures, together with record rainfall in that month, led to autumn flowering events. The phenological characteristics of the spring pollen season were also influential. In the years with a shorter spring, the Ouercus pollen season tended to present autumn flowerings. A multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model was built to explain the effects of the different variables on the occurrence of autumn pollination. The results indicated that the combined effect of three predicting variables, September rainfall, the length of the spring pollen season, and the end of the spring pollen season, explained 92% of the variance. The validation showed a strong relationship between the expected and the observed autumn pollen concentrations. Therefore, the present analysis of a long-term pollen database revealed that the main causes of this unusual second flowering in autumn were strongly related to climate change, i.e., strong dry summers and warm autumns. In addition, the results showed that the phenomenon was more frequent in the years with low pollination during spring due to different meteorological events potentiated by climate change, such as dryness or heavy rain episodes, as a way of ensuring acorn crops. The results explain how this unusual and lesser-known phenomenon in agroforestry dynamics is related to the adaptation to climate change and the main factors that are driving it, as well as the potential consequences for these important and endangered Mediterranean ecosystems. pollen; Ouercus; holm oak; autumn flowering; secondary pollination;PHENOLOGY; POLLEN; REGRESSION; VARIABLES; DYNAMICS; GROWTH; TIME; ILEX","Determining Extreme Still Water Levels for Design and Planning Purposes Incorporating Sea Level Rise: Sydney, Australia This paper provides an Extreme Value Analysis (EVA) of the hourly water level record at Fort Denison dating back to 1915 to understand the statistical likelihood of the combination of high predicted tides and the more dynamic influences that can drive ocean water levels higher at the coast. The analysis is based on the Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method using a fitted Generalised Pareto Distribution (GPD) function to estimate extreme hourly heights above mean sea level. The analysis highlights the impact of the 1974 East Coast Low event and rarity of the associated measured water level above mean sea level at Sydney, with an estimated return period exceeding 1000 years. Extreme hourly predictions are integrated with future projections of sea level rise to provide estimates of relevant still water levels at 2050, 2070 and 2100 for a range of return periods (1 to 1000 years) for use in coastal zone management, design, and sea level rise adaptation planning along the NSW coastline. The analytical procedures described provide a step-by-step guide for practitioners on how to develop similar baseline information from any long tide gauge record and the associated limitations and key sensitivities that must be understood and appreciated in applying EVA. nan;Climate change; Design; Extreme value analysis; Planning; Sea-level rise; Pareto principle; Regional planning; Sea level; Tide gages; Value engineering; Water levels; Australia; Design and planning; Extreme-value analysis; Generalized Pareto Distributions; Mean sea level; Ocean water; Peaks-over-threshold method; Return periods; Sea level rise; Still water levels; Climate change; coastal zone management; sea level change; tide gauge; water level; Australia; New South Wales; Sydney [New South Wales]","Impact of 3DVAR Data Assimilation on the Prediction of Heavy Rainfall over Southern China This study examines the impact of three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) on the prediction of two heavy rainfall events over Southern China by using a real-time storm-scale forecasting system. Initialized from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution data, the forecasting system is characterized by combining the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model and the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) 3DVAR package. Observations from Doppler radars, surface Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network, and radiosondes are used in the experiments to evaluate the impact of data assimilation on short-term quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) skill. Results suggest that extrasurface AWS data assimilation has slight but general positive impact on rainfall location forecasts. Surface AWS data also improve model results of near-surface variables. Radiosonde data assimilation improves the QPF skill by improving rainfall position accuracy and reducing rainfall overprediction. Compared with radar data, the overall impact of additional surface and radiosonde data is smaller and is reflected primarily in reducing rainfall overestimation. The assimilation of all radar, surface, and radiosonde data has a more positive impact on the forecast skill than the assimilation of either type of data only for the two rainfall events. nan;4-DIMENSIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION; MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM; RADAR DATA ASSIMILATION; LEVEL-II DATA; CLOUD ANALYSIS; PART II; TORNADIC THUNDERSTORMS; RADIOSONDE TEMPERATURE; REFLECTIVITY DATA; FORT-WORTH","Climate Wars? A Systematic Review of Empirical Analyses on the Links between Climate Change and Violent Conflict Global climate change has been connected to myriad societal and environmental consequences, including the potential for a rise in violent conflict. To advance understanding of violent conflict as a threat, we undertake a systematic review of peer-reviewed, empirical analyses examining the potential links between climate change and violent conflict. The review reveals three key findings. First, the reviewed studies offer mixed and varied evidence for links between climate change and violence. A majority of studies find evidence that climate variables are associated with higher levels of violent conflict. However, this general pattern masks many subtleties and countertrends that complicate moving to a simple conclusion that the link between climate change and violence is robust. Second, most studies hypothesize an indirect relationship between climate change and violent conflict mediated by and/or interacting with a complex set of intervening variables; however, these causal pathways have only weak empirical support. Third, the empirical basis of the literature has important limitations. Study findings appear to be sensitive to differing methodological choices, making systematic assessments inconclusive. climate change; violent conflict; adaptation; climate change policy;SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; CIVIL CONFLICT; NATURAL DISASTERS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; ARMED CONFLICT; EAST-AFRICA; LAST MILLENNIUM; VARIABILITY; WEATHER; TEMPERATURE","Landscape management and landscape changes towards more naturalness and wilderness: Effects on scenic qualities-The case of the Muritz National Park in Germany This paper analyses the consequences and effects of management towards more naturalness and wilderness, using the case of the Muritz National Park as an example. Planned management actions for enhancing naturalness and providing space for wilderness are examined. The scenic qualities of the national park landscape are analysed in terms of the management objectives and with the appropriate tools. For open landscapes, we applied the Delphi survey method to forecast their appearances in 2020 and 2035. A forest growth simulator was used to describe the change in forest tree species composition over the coming decades, and well into the 22nd century.

To further document the Holocene evolution of the Nile's Canopic mouth, a core was taken from the southern shores of Abu Qir Bay, close to the ancient Canopic channel. Core bio-sedimentology and chronostratigraphy highlight four stages of marine incursion which are juxtaposed upon the general progradation trend of the Nile coast in this area. Compiled age-depth points from sediment cores taken in Abu Qir Bay underscore two phases of negative sediment budget at the Canopic mouth: (1) a first period, between 3.5 and 2 ka cal. yr BC, probably in relation to the well-documented mid-to-late Holocene decline in Nile flow; and (2) a second phase, after 0.5 ka cal. AD, linked to a decline in Canopic sediment supply to the coastal area, and concomitant with the development of the Rashid branch. The erosion and reworking of material flattened and lowered the promontory surface by up to 4 m. The submersion of the Canopic promontory was completed by relative sea-level rise, primarily controlled by the compaction and liquefaction of unconsolidated lagoonal muds. The lowering of the Canopic mouth led to the submersion of two ancient estuarine-harbor cities, known as East-Canopus and Herakleion, whose remains lie 4-7 m below present mean sea level. It is argued that the subsidence of the two cities cannot explain their abandonment during the late 7th early 8th century AD, taking into account the regional occupation pattern during Antiquity. Rather, the longevity of the two cities, spanning more than 13 centuries, shows that adaptation to coastal risks including erosion, subsidence and high-energy events like storms or tsunamis, was the rule.

Due to the breakdown of law and order, selective attacks, and a climate of fear, most of the community had relocated from the Kashmir valley to the south in Jammu and to even cities such as New Delhi, constituting one of the most prominent groups of Internally Displaced Persons in the region. While there is an interest in repatriation/resettlement in scholarship and policy, the experiences of the Pandits reveal the multiple meanings return' holds for the displaced. This article will draw on the experiences of Pandit forced migrants in Jammu who have returned to visit Kashmir. Their experiences will be situated with work on return migration, the Kashmir conflict, and the political location of the Pandits in the region. The article argues that return migration is an inconclusive phenomenon that critically raises questions of home and uncertainty, and provides a way to understand how the displaced locate themselves in the world. nan;PLACE","Comparison of different methods in estimating potential evapotranspiration at Muda Irrigation Scheme of Malaysia Evapotranspiration (ET) is a complex process in the hydrological cycle that influences the quantity of runoff and thus the irrigation water requirements. Numerous methods have been developed to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET). Unfortunately, most of the reliable PET methods are parameter rich models and therefore, not feasible for application in data scarce regions. On the other hand, accuracy and reliability of simple PET models vary widely according to regional climate conditions. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of three temperature-based and three radiation-based simple ET methods in estimating historical ET and projecting future ET at Muda Irrigation Scheme at Kedah, Malaysia. The performance was measured by comparing those methods with the parameter intensive Penman-Monteith Method. It was found that radiation based methods gave better performance compared to temperature-based methods in estimation of ET in the study area. Future ET simulated from projected climate data obtained through statistical downscaling technique also showed that radiation-based methods can project closer ET values to that projected by Penman-Monteith Method. It is expected that the study will guide in selecting suitable methods for estimating and projecting ET in accordance to availability of meteorological data.

We make the following basic claims: 1. Individuals exiting prison have poor work experience, low levels of education, and generally qualify for only low-skill, entry-level jobs. Moreover, the majority will recidivate within 3 years. Employment training programs are designed to ameliorate these deficits, but to date, they have demonstrated only limited potential to improve employment prospects and recidivism risk. 2. Despite a poor track record for employment-based reentry programming, a substantial minority of individuals exiting prison has desisted from crime and has the capacity to maintain stable employment. 3. Growing evidence suggests that this desistance process occurs quickly-almost instantaneously-and is driven by decisions on the part of the individual to change. 4. This type of instantaneous, agent-based change is difficult to predict using static risk prediction tools. As a result, desistance is fundamentally unobservable to employers and others who might wish to identify good employees from the group of people who have criminal history records. In lieu of additional information, one's true desistance state will only be revealed through time. This situation is a classic case of a market with asymmetric information. 5. Although growing numbers of employers refuse to hire individuals with criminal history records, some are in fact willing to hire from this pool of workers. More might be willing to do so if they could reliably identify desisters. The current legal environment is increasingly hostile to across-the-board bans on hiring individuals with criminal history records without documentation of business necessity. 6. Program participation, completion, and endorsement from a training organization can provide a reliable signal to employers that a given individual has desisted and is prepared to be a productive employee, as long as the cost to program completion is high for those who have not desisted, and low for those who have desisted. Effective signals must be voluntary. Requiring program completion, or graduating all participants, renders the signal useless. 7. Existing evidence demonstrates that program participants (or program completers) do in fact recidivate less often and have better employment outcomes than program nonparticipants (or program dropouts), even in cases where the program does not seem to ""work"" in a causal sense. This evidence can be taken to suggest that program completion provides valuable information-a signal-to the labor market. 8. Limited anecdotal evidence suggests that some employers-among those willing to hire individuals with a criminal history record-may already be using completion of employment training programs to identify ""good employees"" among the pool of low-skill labor. 9. The development of effective signals could create a net gain to society if, in the absence of signals, employers will largely avoid hiring individuals with criminal history records. Evidence suggests that individuals with prison records are exiting the labor market at higher rates than in the past. 10. The signaling approach is different than risk prediction because it relies on actions taken by individuals to reveal information about them that is, by definition, unobservable. Information about program completion can be valuable even if the program has not caused individuals to change. 11. Other actions besides completion of employment training programs also could function as useful signals in domains other than employment. Policy Implications Reframing the problem of reentry as a case of asymmetric information could potentially have dramatic implications for policy makers struggling to deal with the growing number of individuals with criminal history records, who are increasingly disconnected from the labor market. This disconnection occurs, at least in part, because this group is more readily identifiable through the use of criminal background checks. Although restricting the use of background checks may be infeasible in the current legal climate, policy makers are actively working to create standards for hiring individuals with criminal history records. For example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is currently revising its guidance for hiring individuals with criminal history records. It is hard to overstate the level of interest, by both advocates and employers, in these ongoing discussions. Research insight could be incorporated into government statutes that currently bar individuals with criminal history records from certain types of employment. Indirectly, such guidelines also would help individuals with criminal history records trying to identify themselves to employers as ""good bets."" Key elements of a research plan needed to develop this idea further include: 1. Formalizing the argument with a theoretical model that can be explicitly parameterized. Key elements of the argument depend crucially on factors such as the size of the desisting population, the outcome in the absence of effective signals, and the magnitude of the correlation between the cost of the signal and desistance. Proper specification of the requirements for effective signals in this context could then inform empirical tests of the model. . 2. Empirical testing for evidence that employers are already using factors such as program completion as signals. This testing can include surveys of employers who hire individuals with criminal history records to develop some idea of how they discriminate between individuals with criminal history records. Other potential methods include attempts to compare labor market outcomes of individuals with otherwise similar skill levels, one who has identifiably completed a program and one who has not. Empirical research testing the strength of the link between the concept of crime desistance and work productivity also would be valuable. 3. Calculating the relative costs of programs that provide signals with more traditional risk prediction tools that take advantage of currently available information. Creating these programs to generate signals only can be justified if the additional information generates savings over and above what can be gained by more passive methods. 4. Better understanding the trade-offs between maintaining voluntary programs to generate signals and creating mandatory programs, like Project HOPE, that might enhance rehabilitation. Although signaling and rehabilitation are not competing concepts, the requirement that signals be voluntarily acquired could potentially conflict with mandatory rehabilitation programs. In the short term, it might not be necessary to wait for the completion of this research before policy makers can make progress in this area. We are aware of one set of programs, often called Certificates of Relief, Rehabilitation, or Good Conduct, by which policy makers explicitly identify individuals with criminal history records who have met certain requirements, including program completion. In the strongest cases, these certificates carry with them explicit removal of statutory restrictions on individuals with criminal history records. In our view, these government-run programs are an attempt to create an explicit signal for employers that these individuals have desisted from crime. However, we are not aware of attempts to validate the standards used to qualify individuals for these certificates, nor are we aware of attempts to verify whether these signals work to create better opportunities for the involved individuals. We urge those involved in these programs to redouble their efforts to validate these promising programs.

Europe emerges as an especially responsive area where the grapevine is largely recognised as one of the most important crops, playing a key environmental and socio-economic role. The mounting evidence on significant impacts of climate change on viticulture urges the scientific community in investigating the potential evolution of these impacts in the upcoming decades. In this review work, a first attempt for the compilation of selected scientific research on this subject, during a relatively recent time frame (2010-2020), is implemented. For this purpose, a thorough investigation through multiple search queries was conducted and further screened by focusing exclusively on the predicted productivity parameters (phenology timing, product quality and yield) and cultivation area alteration. Main findings on the potential impacts of future climate change are described as changes in grapevine phenological timing, alterations in grape and wine composition, heterogeneous effects on grapevine yield, the expansion into areas that were previously unsuitable for grapevine cultivation and significant geographical displacements in traditional growing areas. These compiled findings may facilitate and delineate the implementation of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, ultimately potentiating the future sustainability of European viticulture. grapevine; grapevine yield; grape quality; berry quality; wine grape phenology; viticultural area; climate variability; future climate; European viticulture;VITIS-VINIFERA L.; GRAPEVINE PHENOLOGY; WINE PRODUCTION; ELEVATED CO2; MODEL PROJECTIONS; POTENTIAL IMPACT; RECENT TRENDS; DOURO VALLEY; TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES","Spectral-Based Monitoring of Climate Effects on the Inter-Annual Variability of Different Plant Functional Types in Mediterranean Cork Oak Woodlands Using remotely sensed data to estimate the biophysical properties of vegetation in woodlands is a challenging task due to their heterogeneous nature. The objective of this study was to assess the biophysical parameters of different vegetation types (cork oak trees, shrubs and herbaceous vegetation) in cork oak woodland through the analysis of temporal trends in spectral vegetation indices (VIs). A seven-year database (from 2011 until 2017) of in situ observations collected with a field spectroradiometer with a monthly basis was used and four VIs were derived, considered as proxies for several biophysical properties of vegetation such as biomass (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI); chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index-MTCI), tissue water content (Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI) and the carotenoid/chlorophyll ratio (Photochemical Reflectance Index-PRI). During the analyzed period, some key meteorological data (precipitation, temperature, relative air humidity and global radiation) were collected for the study site, aggregated at three different time-lags (short period (30 d), medium period (90 d) and hydrological period (HIDR)), and their relationship with VIs was analyzed. The results showed different trends for each vegetation index and vegetation type. In NDVI and NDWI, herbaceous vegetation showed a highly marked seasonal trend, whereas for MTCI, it was the cork oak and Cistus salvifolius, and for PRI, it was Ulex airensis that showed the marked seasonal trend. Shrubs have large differences depending on the species: the shallow-rooted Cistus salvifolius showed a higher seasonal variability than the deep-rooted Ulex airensis. Our results revealed the importance of temperature and precipitation as the main climatic variables influencing VI variability in the four studied vegetation types. This study sets up the relationships between climate and vegetation indices for each vegetation type. Spectral vegetation indices are useful tools for assessing the impact of climate on vegetation, because using these makes it easier to monitor the amount of ""greenness"", biomass and water stress of vegetation than assessing the photosynthetic efficiency. Proximal remote sensing measurements are fundamental for the correct use of remote sensing in monitoring complex agroforest ecosystems, largely used to inform policies to improve resilience to drought, particularly in the Mediterranean region. vegetation indices; spectroradiometry; phenology; climate-vegetation relationships; Mediterranean woodlands;RADIATION-USE EFFICIENCY; DROUGHT; INDEX; PHENOLOGY; RESPONSES; WINTER; WATER","Modeling Future Land Use Development: A Lithuanian Case Effective management decisions regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions may be hampered by the lack of scientific tools for modeling future land use change. This study addresses methodological principles for land use development scenario modeling assumed for use in processes of GHG accounting and management. Associated land use policy implications in Lithuania are also discussed. Data on land uses, available from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and collected for GHG accounting from the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector in the country, as well as freely available geographic information, were tested as an input for modeling land use development in the country. The modeling was implemented using the TerrSet Land Change Modeler. Calibration of the modeling approach using historical land use data indicated that land use types important for GHG management in the LULUCF sector were predicted with an accuracy above 80% during a five-year period into the future, while the prediction accuracy for forest and built-up land was 96% or more. Based on several land management scenarios tested, it was predicted that the LULUCF sector in Lithuania will accumulate CO2, with the forest land use type contributing most to CO2 absorption. Key measures to improve the GHG balance and carbon stock changes were suggested to be the afforestation of abandoned or unused agricultural land and prevention of the conversion of grassland into producing land. land use; land use change; scenario; carbon stock changes; simulation; forest; producing land; grassland;CLIMATE-CHANGE; COVER CHANGE; SIMULATE; PATTERN; TOOLS","Revegetation has increased ecosystem water-use efficiency during 2000-2014 in the Chinese Loess Plateau: Evidence from satellite data Vegetation coverage has been effectively increased across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) mainly because of the implementation of large-scale revegetation programs. Understanding the entire CLP's ecosystem carbon-water relationship and its response to the vegetation coverage increase and climate change is essential for the water resources management in this semi-humid to arid region. Water-use efficiency (WUE), defined as the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) over evapotranspiration (ET), is an important indicator linking carbon and water cycles at the ecosystem scale. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations in the ecosystem WUE were analyzed to investigate the responses of WUE variation to regional climate and vegetation coverage changes in the CLP using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets of GPP and ET from 2000 to 2014. Results indicate that the spatial pattern of annual WUE was different from that of WUE over active growing season (AGS), generally with higher annual WUE but lower AGS-WUE for the semi-humid southeastern CLP areas. Significant increases were observed in annual and autumn WUE during the study period at both the per-pixel and spatial-average levels, while AGS-WUE, spring WUE, and summer WUE remained quite stable. Correlations between WUE trends and interannual variability of vegetation coverage (expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI), precipitation (P), and air temperature (T-a) showed that WUE trends were positively correlated with NDVI variation due to faster increases in GPP as compared to ET caused by enhanced NDVI. Precipitation variation was generally negatively correlated to WUE variation by contributing to faster increases in ET than GPP especially at different seasons. The positive correlations between interannual variability of WUE and T-a were subject to negative feedbacks between ET and T-a. Similar results were also found using net primary productivity (NPP) to calculate ecosystem annual WUE (i.e., NPP/ET). Our findings suggest that revegetation-induced vegetation coverage change rather than P and T-a changes is the primary cause for the increasing ecosystem annual WUE in the CLP. This study contributes to our enhanced understanding of the coupled carbon-water dynamics over regional terrestrial ecosystem under climate and vegetation coverage changes.

A multistage sampling technique was used to obtain primary data from 543 rice farmers from three regions in Northern Ghana through questionnaire administration. A multivariate probit regression model was employed to examine the factors influencing farmers' participation in the fertilizer subsidy program and adoption of certified rice seeds. Also, Heckman's Two-Stage Model was used to examine the effect of farmers' participation in the fertilizer subsidy program on the adoption of certified rice seeds. The results revealed that farmers' participation in the fertilizer subsidy program had a positive significant influence on the adoption of certified rice seeds. Age, education, access to training on rice production and use of irrigation had positive significant influence on farmers' adoption of certified rice seeds. This study recommends that the fertilizer subsidy program should be up-scaled to benefit more farmers for effective adoption of certified seeds to foster increased agricultural productivity.

In this article, I investigate how public perceptions of climate change risk are affected by communications from political parties and the degree of polarization among them. Specifically, using survey data from Sweden, Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, I study the relationship between party source cues, perceived polarization, and public perceptions of climate change risk. The results reveal a positive relationship between party cues and perceptions of climate change risk, indicating that individuals adjust their risk perceptions to align with their party preference. Furthermore, a negative relationship between perceived polarization and individual risk perceptions is also discovered, showing that individuals tend to be less concerned with climate change the more polarization they perceive. However, the effect of perceived polarization is found to be limited to more abstract perceptions of risk, while being unrelated to perceptions of concrete risks. Even with some contextual variance, the results generally hold up well across the four countries.

However, these studies are often limited by missing data, and suffer from the methodological limitation that important information is lost when we reduce textual information to quantitative data. This study was motivated by nine case studies that appeared to be inconsistent with the expectation that the presence of Ostrom's Design Principles increases the likelihood of successful common pool resource governance. These cases highlight the limitations of coding and analysing large-N case studies. We examine two issues: 1) the challenge of missing data and 2) potential approaches that rely on context (which is often lost in the coding process) to address inconsistencies between empirical observations and theoretical predictions. For the latter, we conduct a post-hoc qualitative analysis of a large-N comparative study to explore 2 types of inconsistencies: 1) cases where evidence for nearly all design principles was found, but available evidence led to the assessment that the CPR system was unsuccessful and 2) cases where the CPR system was deemed successful despite finding limited or no evidence for design principles. We describe inherent challenges to large-N comparative analysis and to coding complex and dynamically changing common pool resource systems for the presence or absence of design principles and the determination of ""success"". Finally, we illustrate how, in some cases, our qualitative analysis revealed that the identity of absent design principles explained inconsistencies, and hence reconciled such apparent inconsistencies with theoretical predictions. This analysis demonstrates the value of combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, and using mixed-methods approaches iteratively to build comprehensive methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding common pool resource governance in a dynamically changing context.

Knowledge about this capacity, often called ""governance capacity,"" is still fragmented and quite incoherent. The aim of this study is therefore to gain an integrated understanding of governance capacity. To do this, we conducted a literature review and organized focus groups. This resulted in the selection of five elements of governance capacity: (1) collective action, (2) coordination, (3) resilience, (4) learning, and (5) resources. We used these elements to form the first contours of a governance capacity framework. governance; governance capacity; framework;CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; BUILDING INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY; WATER GOVERNANCE; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; POLICY CAPACITY; ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; TRANSFORMATIVE CAPACITY; COLLABORATIVE CAPACITY; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; POLITICAL CAPACITY","Extreme weather events induced deaths in India 2001-2014: Trends and differentials by region, sex and age group This study examined the trend in extreme weather event related mortality reported in India during 2001-14 and explored the regional, age and sex differentials in such fatalities. We used age and sex-segregated data on the number of accidental deaths by unnatural causes released by Government of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy. Various extreme weather events were grouped into five broad categories: cold wave, extreme precipitation, heat wave, lightning, and tropical cyclone. During 2001-14, 25% of all accidental deaths due to unnatural causes happened as a result of extreme weather events. Deaths due to extreme precipitation and tropical cyclones declined over time, whereas increasing trend was observed for lightning, and extreme temperature conditions. Most of the extreme weather event induced deaths were due to lightning, followed by extreme precipitation and temperature extremes. The burden of death was highest in the central part of India. States of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal were affected the most by extreme weather events. More males and older population died than their counterparts. Findings suggest that people are adaptive to some extreme weather events such as cold wave and cyclones; whereas adaptation and coping with the heat wave and extreme precipitation seems to be less. Building awareness on the adaptive mechanisms to different extremes and a community-centered alert system can help in reducing fatalities due to extreme weather events.

We compared heart and brain mitochondrial responses to acute thermal challenges and to thermal acclimation using high-resolution respirometry in two locally adapted subspecies of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus). We predicted that 5 degrees C acclimation would result in compensatory increases in mitochondrial performance, while 33 degrees C acclimation would cause suppression of mitochondrial function to minimize the effects of high temperature on mitochondrial metabolism. In contrast, acclimation to both 33 and 5 degrees C decreased mitochondrial performance compared with fish acclimated to 15 degrees C. These adjustments could represent an energetic cost-saving mechanism at temperature extremes. Acclimation responses were similar in both heart and brain; however, this effect was smaller in the heart, which might indicate its importance in maintaining whole-animal thermal performance. Alternatively, larger acclimation effects in the brain might indicate greater thermal sensitivity compared with the heart. We detected only modest differences between subspecies that were dependent on the tissue assayed. These data demonstrate extensive plasticity in mitochondrial performance following thermal acclimation in killifish, and indicate that the extent of these responses differs between tissues, highlighting the importance and complexity of mitochondrial regulation in thermal acclimation in eurytherms.

The new model supporting developing countries' self-reliance and ""leapfrog"" development should be put forward with cooperation between the developed and developing countries. In this regard, Japan has moved forward with this form of support towards Asia, and as a result, Asia's own climate response capacity has gradually risen. Published by AIP Publishing. nan;nan","Implications of sea-level rise for continental Portugal The Portuguese coastline has a high diversity of coastal types, which will react differently to an accelerated sea-level rise. Estuaries and coastal lagoons will be most affected by a rising sea level. Amongst these, the Sado and Tagus estuaries and the Ria de Aveiro and the Ria Formosa coastal lagoons are probably the ones where socioeconomic impacts resulting from accelerated sea-level rise would be greatest. Sandy shores will face increased erosion. However, it is likely that at this type of coast other factors, such as sand deficiency caused by damming river basins, will continue to play a larger role in erosion than accelerated sea-level rise. Hard rocky coasts will be the least affected by accelerated sea-level rise. Specific adaptation policies for accelerated sea-level rise impacts do not presently exist in Portugal. However, existing laws can be used to prevent and/or reduce socioeconomic impacts if they are strictly applied. A strong commitment to coastal management by Portuguese authorities is therefore necessary in order to prevent and minimise future implications of accelerated sea-level rise. coastal impacts; coastal erosion; coastal management;NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; TRENDS","A Marine Oil Terminal Trestle Repair and Replacement Project This paper discusses the repair and replacement of an existing 90-yr old timber berth and trestle to meet the operational and seismic demands mandated by the Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and Maintenance Standards (MOTEMS). Many older marine oil terminals in California have been required to meet the MOTEMS regulations. However, many operators are looking for innovative ways to achieve the regulation requirements with restricted capital budgets. This terminal meets the MOTEMS requirements and capital constraints by replacing and repairing portions of the trestle. The strengthened structures meet the present demands for operational and seismic conditions as well as climate change issues. The author and his colleagues have recently completed the design and permitting of the first timber structure in the San Francisco Bay Area that includes operational, seismic, and sea level impact design requirements. The paper discusses the geotechnical and operational constraints, design criteria, permitting coordination, climate change adaptive measures, instrumentation requirements, early construction issues, and path forward for future waterfront structures. This paper also discusses the various alternative replacement and repair designs, the selection of the most cost effective options, lessons learned and some pitfalls to avoid for future rehabilitation projects. nan;Budget control; Cost effectiveness; Design; Marine engineering; Oil terminals; Ports and harbors; Repair; Sea level; Seismic design; Seismology; Standards; Timber; Capital constraints; Marine oil terminal engineering and maintenance standards; Marine oil terminals; Operational constraints; Rehabilitation projects; Replacement projects; San Francisco Bay; Waterfront structures; Climate change","Hydrological characteristics of Australia: national catchment classification and regional relationships A continent-wide classification study of Australian catchments was undertaken to group drainage basins with comparable flow characteristics based on forty metrics from the themes of climate, topography, surface condition and hydrogeology. A principal component analysis reduced the multi-collinear indices to nine principal components (PCs). A fuzzy c-means cluster analysis on the PCs resulted in the delineation of eight subcatchment clusters with similar physiography, and 82.5% of subcatchments displaying a membership coefficient greater than 0.7. Subcatchments with poor cluster membership levels may be significant in highlighting complexity in the interaction between climatic controls and local geomorphological and land use variability. The clusters are distinguished by different attributes in several key subcatchment variables and each group is described in terms of its flow and flood profile. These interpretations are supported by separately derived streamflow signatures from gauged catchments. Cluster and PC distribution mapping revealed distinct spatial and drainage relationships between the subcatchments relevant to the assessment of flood behaviour. The spatial pattern of the river basin regionalisation via physical catchment similarity closely resembles the modified Ko center dot ppen climate classification, with differences highlighting the importance of non-climate characteristics on streamflow behaviour in Australia. The catchment classification is an Australia-wide regionalisation scheme, incorporating datasets with disparate spatial distribution and ungauged subcatchments. This study therefore provides the framework for more detailed streamflow analysis by applying consistent methods across all catchments in Australia, and has implications for flood risk prediction, mitigation and planning.

It is seen that the recent El Nino has been accompanied by higher fluctuation in glacier coverage on Nevado Champara and the loss of glacier coverage on Cerro Tilata was very high during the past 16 years. Rise in snowline altitude of selected glaciers was very high after the 2015/16 El Nino. Increase in the area covered by snow and ice during the La Nina periods were not enough to cover the ice loss occurred during the previous El Nino events and the strongest El Nino in 2015/16 was followed by a significant loss of ice-covered areas in the tropical Andes. Freshwater resources in this region will be affected in the near future if the current trends in glacier decline continue.

The IPCC's assessment of the impacts of climate change on agriculture all but ignores human agency and human ingenuity. The statement in the SPM on violent conflict is much stronger than in the chapter and indeed the literature. AR5 ignores the literature on the impacts of climate change on cold-related mortality and morbidity. On poverty traps, WG2 reaches a conclusion that is not supported by the cited papers. The total impacts of climate change were assessed in four subsequent IPCC reports. Although there are no statistically significant differences between the assessment periods in the underlying literature, the subsequent SPMs reach very different conclusions. In sum, the IPCC has yet to reach the quality that one would expect from a gold standard.

This study aimed to examine a very short-term effect of heat on the risk of acute kidney injury at an hourly level and assessed potential modification effects by age, gender and preexisting diseases. Methods: We performed a time-stratified case-crossover design with a conditional logistic regression model to examine the association between hourly temperature and hourly emergency department visits for acute kidney injury (N = 1815) in Queensland state of Australia, 2013-2015. Heat effect on acute kidney injury was reported for temperature increases from 50th percentile (26.1 degrees C) to 95th percentile (33.6 degrees C). Results: The effect of heat on acute kidney injury occurred in the same hour of heat exposure (odds ratio (OR): 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 1.71), with no temperature threshold observed. Males (OR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.85, 3.32) and those aged > 64 years (OR: 2.93; 95% CI: 2.01, 4.27), particularly those with pre-existing diabetes (OR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.91, 3.30), hypertension (OR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.61, 3.15), heart failure (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.72, 2.84), or chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.59; 95% CI: 1.89, 3.55), were at great risks of acute kidney injury attack after exposure to heat. Conclusions: General practitioners and specialists should remind their patients about this risk in summer. Tailored heat adaptation strategies protecting adults working outdoors are urgently needed, especially within the context of climate change.

Contested Values Constrain Just Transitions to Agroforestry Agroforestry is often promoted as a multi-benefit solution to increasing the resilience of agricultural landscapes. Yet, there are many obstacles to transitioning agricultural production systems to agroforestry. Research on agroforestry transitions often focuses on why farmers and land managers chose to adopt this type of stewardship, with less focus on the political context of practitioner decisions. We use the case study of agroforestry in Hawai'i to explore how agroforestry transitions occur with particular attention to politics and power dynamics. Specifically, we ask, what factors drive and/or restrain transitions to agroforestry and who is able to participate. We interviewed 38 agroforestry practitioners in Hawai'i and analyzed the data using constructivist grounded theory. We then held a focus group discussion with interview participants to share results and discuss solutions. Practitioners primarily chose agroforestry intentionally for non-economic and values-based reasons, rather than as a means to production or economic goals. Agroforestry practitioners face a similar suite of structural obstacles as other agricultural producers, including access to land, labor, and capital and ecological obstacles like invasive species and climate change. However, the conflict in values between practitioners and dominant institutions manifests as four additional dimensions of obstacles constraining agroforestry transitions: systems for accessing land, capital, and markets favor short-term production and economic value; Indigenous and local knowledge is not adequately valued; regulatory, funding, and other support institutions are siloed; and not enough appropriate information is accessible. Who is able to practice despite these obstacles is tightly linked with people's ability to access off-site resources that are inequitably distributed. Our case study highlights three key points with important implications for realizing just agroforestry transitions: (1) practitioners transition to agroforestry to restore ecosystems and reclaim sovereignty, not just for the direct benefits; (2) a major constraint to agroforestry transitions is that the term agroforestry is both unifying and exclusionary; (3) structural change is needed for agroforestry transitions to be just. We discuss potential solutions in the context of Hawai'i and provide transferrable principles and actionable strategies for achieving equity in agroforestry transitions. We also demonstrate a transferrable approach for action-oriented, interdisciplinary research in support of just agroforestry transitions. agroecology; political ecology; food system; transformation; Hawai'i; equity; food sovereignty;POLITICAL ECOLOGY; FOOD SYSTEMS; AGRICULTURE; KNOWLEDGE; RESTORATION","Impact of Sowing Dates on Terminal Heat Tolerance of Different Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Cultivars Terminal heat stress leads to significant yield reduction in wheat. Adaptation strategies to combat this could be either growing heat-tolerant cultivars or adjustments in sowing date. A study was conducted for 2 years to understand the impact of terminal heat stress on wheat using three different wheat cultivars (HD 2932, WR 544 and HD 2967) and three sowing date, viz. D-1 (second week of November), D-2 (first week of December) and D-3 (last week of December) at Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, India. Results revealed that timely sown crop (D1) showed significantly higher number of tillers m(-2) (450), plant height (93.5 cm), 1000-grain weight (38 g), grain yield (6.3 t ha(-1)) and harvest index (0.44) compared with D2 and D3. Yield loss occurred by 70, 29 and 77 kg ha(-1) per day due to delay in sowing beyond D-1 in varieties, viz. 'HD 2932,' 'WR 544' and 'HD 2967,' respectively. The late-sown crop resulted lower yield, which encountered higher temperature in its terminal growth stages. Among three varieties used, 'WR 544' had lesser decline in growth and yield than other two varieties due to late sowing. It implied that 'WR 544' had thermotolerant characteristics. Higher yield in wheat requires both heat-tolerant cultivars and better agronomic strategy under terminal heat stress condition. This study concluded that varietal selection and adjustment in sowing date could be the appropriate adaptation strategies under changing climate especially the terminal heat stress.

At present, ethanol in the country is mainly a fermentation/distillery product of cane molasses, although cassava and cane juice are considered other potential raw materials for the fuel. This study aims to evaluate the environmental impacts of substituting conventional gasoline (CG) with molasses-based gasohol in Thailand. Materials and methods The life cycle assessment (LCA) procedure carried out follows three interrelated phases: inventory analysis, characterization and interpretation. The functional unit for the comparison is 1 l gasoline equivalent consumed by a new passenger car to travel a specific distance. Results The results of the study show that molasses-based ethanol (MoE) in the form of 10% blend with gasoline (E10), along its whole life cycle, consumes less fossil energy (5.3%), less petroleum (8.1%) and provides a similar impact on acidification compared to CG. The fuel, however, has inferior performance in other categories (e.g. global warming potential, nutrient enrichment and photochemical ozone creation potential) indicated by increased impacts over CG. Discussion In most cases, higher impacts from the upstream of molasses-based ethanol tend to govern its net life cycle impacts relative to CG. This makes the fuel blend less environmentally friendly than CG for the specific conditions considered. However, as discussed later, this situation can be improved by appropriate changes in energy carriers. Conclusions The LCA procedure helps identify the key areas in the MoE production cycle where changes are required to improve environmental performance. Specifically, they are: (1) use of coal as energy source for ethanol conversion, (2) discharge of distillery spent wash into an anaerobic pond, and (3) open burning of cane trash in sugar cane production. Recommendations and perspectives Measures to improve the overall life cycle energy and environmental impacts of MoE are: (1) substituting biomass for fossil fuels in ethanol conversion, (2) capturing CH4 from distillery spent wash and using it as an energy supply, and (3) utilizing cane trash for energy instead of open burning in fields. cane molasses; case study; energy; environmental performance; fuel ethanol; LCA; life cycle assessment; MoE; molasses-based ethanol; Thailand;ENERGY","Application and verification of a multivariate real-time early warning method for rainfall-induced landslides: implication for evolution of landslide-generated debris flows Rainfall-induced landslides are a frequent and often catastrophic geological disaster, and the development of accurate early warning systems for such events is a primary challenge in the field of risk reduction. Understanding of the physical mechanisms of rainfall-induced landslides is key for early warning and prediction. In this study, a real-time multivariate early warning method based on hydro-mechanical analysis and a long-term sequence of real-time monitoring data was proposed and verified by applying the method to predict successive debris flow events that occurred in 2017 and 2018 in Yindongzi Gully, which is in Wenchuan earthquake region, China. Specifically, long-term sequence slope stability analysis of the in situ datasets for the landslide deposit as a benchmark was conducted, and a multivariate indicator early warning method that included the rainfall intensity-probability (I-P), saturation (S-i), and inclination (I-r) was then proposed. The measurements and analysis in the two early warning scenarios not only verified the reliability and practicality of the multivariate early warning method but also revealed the evolution processes and mechanism of the landslide-generated debris flow in response to rainfall. Thus, these findings provide a new strategy and guideline for accurately producing early warnings of rainfall-induced landslides.

The current NHTSA analysis is the most thorough investigation of this issue to date. LBNL's assessment of the analysis indicates that the estimated effect of mass reduction on risk is smaller than in the previous studies, and statistically non-significant for all but the lightest cars. The effects three recent trends in vehicle designs and technologies have on societal fatality risk per VMT are estimated, and whether these changes might affect the relationship between vehicle mass and fatality risk in the future. Side airbags are found to reduce fatality risk in cars, but not necessarily light trucks or CUVs/minivans, struck in the side by another light-duty vehicle; reducing the number of fatalities in cars struck in the side is predicted to reduce the estimated detrimental effect of footprint reduction, but increase the detrimental effect of mass reduction, in cars on societal fatality risk. Better alignment of light truck bumpers with those of other vehicles appears to result in a statistically significant reduction in risk imposed on car occupants; however, reducing this type of fatality will likely have little impact on the estimated effect of mass or footprint reduction on risk. Finally, shifting light truck drivers into safer, car-based vehicles, such as sedans, CUVs, and minivans, would result in larger reductions in societal fatalities than expected from even substantial reductions in the masses of light trucks. A strategy of shifting drivers from truck-based to car-based vehicles would reduce fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, while improving societal safety. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A test using Spanish bats One of the main aims of protected areas is to be effective in the conservation of target species, i.e. those of the highest conservation concern. The Natura 2000 network (N2000) of protected areas is the main pillar of European action to halt biodiversity loss. Within N2000, special areas of conservation (SACs) are designated to protect habitats and species of the highest conservation interest, i.e. habitats from Annex I and species (other than birds) listed in Annex II of the Habitat Directive. Thus, a critical and urgent task is to assess the effectiveness of N2000 in the protection of these species. Here, we used distribution data for Spanish bats to test whether the species included in Annex II are better represented in N2000 than the remaining bats found in Spain, since SAC sites were specifically designated to protect the former species. In general, we found significantly high overlapping values between species distribution and N2000 sites (both groups of species are in general over-represented in N2000). However, contrary to our expectations, N2000 (even when only SACs were considered) did not offer higher representation values for the species listed in Annex II than for other species. We found that N2000 performed well even for non-target species, and that species from Annex II could have acted as effective umbrella species for the remaining bat species. Finally, the usefulness of including a species in Annex II is discussed, and guidelines to improve the efficiency of the N2000 for bat conservation are offered.

Few existing climate adaptation frameworks prescribe where to place management actions to be most effective under anticipated future climate conditions. We developed an approach to spatially allocate climate adaptation actions and applied the method to whitebark pine (WBP; Pinus albicaulis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). WBP is expected to be vulnerable to climate-mediated shifts in suitable habitat, pests, pathogens, and fire. We spatially prioritized management actions aimed at mitigating climate impacts to WBP under two management strategies: (1) current management and (2) climate-informed management. The current strategy reflected management actions permissible under existing policy and access constraints. Our goal was to understand how consideration of climate might alter the placement of management actions, so the climate-informed strategies did not include these constraints. The spatial distribution of actions differed among the current and climate-informed management strategies, with 33-60% more wilderness area prioritized for action under climate-informed management. High priority areas for implementing management actions include the 1-8% of the GYE where current and climate-informed management agreed, since this is where actions are most likely to be successful in the long-term and where current management permits implementation. Areas where climate-informed strategies agreed with one another but not with current management (6-22% of the GYE) are potential locations for experimental testing of management actions. Our method for spatial climate adaptation planning is applicable to any species for which information regarding climate vulnerability and climate-mediated risk factors is available.

The meteorological effect (cooling on the near surface temperature) of the two mitigation strategies has been proved by lots of studies while the environmental effect (effect on urban air quality) is still largely unknown. In this paper the WRF-Chem model coupled with a single layer urban canopy model is used to simulate three heat wave and heavy ozone pollution episodes in Shanghai, China. Sensitivity experiments of green roof and cool roof are carried out and the results show that both green roof and cool roof can effectively mitigate urban heat island, and their cooling efficiencies are similar even their cooling mechanisms are different. All of them can reduce the lasting time and area of high temperature and extreme hot, but the ozone pollution may become more serious. According to the different ambient wind field and ozone distribution, these three ozone pollution episodes can be divided into two conditions: urban dome and urban plume. The decrease of urban surface temperature can inhibit the turbulent activities and reduce the height of the boundary layer; the concentration of ozone in urban Zone A (below 750 m height) increases, but decreases in urban Zone B (750 m-2km height) for urban dome. By calculating the ozone fluxes at different heights, we find that the urban heat island circulation can transport surface ozone into city, horizontally; while in Zone B, the horizontal divergence transport ozone out of the city, and green roof and cool roof can decrease the temperature difference between urban and suburban, which can inhibit this ozone transportation of urban heat island circulation.

The native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) was hunted to extinction from Finland and many other countries in Europe in the nineteenth century. In Finland, the species was re-introduced in the 1930s with only a few individuals from Norway. Re-introductions were performed also in other countries of northern Europe and as a result, Eurasian beaver populations have undergone population bottlenecks leading to low levels of genetic diversity. Materials and Methods Here, 200 Eurasian beaver samples from Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Russian Karelia were investigated using 12 microsatellite markers to examine the level of genetic diversity and relationship between the populations. Results While Russian and Estonian populations were genetically the closest, the Finnish population was clearly distinct from all others and had the lowest genetic variability among the study populations. This may be deleterious to the population especially in a changing environment. Conclusions Genetic rescue could be the best solution to increase the genetic diversity and improve the future prospects of the population, although more studies are required to resolve the optimal source population.

The objective of this paper is to examine what are the likely scenarios for some of these islands in the course of the next century, and analyse for each scenario if these Island States could continue to claim an Exclusive Economic Zone or not. Also, it will analyse the possibility that Island States could continue having some sort of status analogous to statehood even if it was to lose all territory. Finally, the idea of a ""government-in-exile"" will be discussed, where the State could retain its identity waiting for a future re-emergence of the island. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To derive more realistic design storms, the occurrence probability of an individual rainstorm event was determined from the joint distribution of storm intensity and duration through a copula model. Hourly rainfall data were used at three climate stations respectively located in Singapore, South Korea and Canada. It was found that the proposed approach could give a more realistic description of rainfall characteristics of rainstorm events and design rainfalls. As results, the design rainfall quantities from actual rainstorm events at the three studied sites are consistently lower than those obtained from the conventional rainfall depth-duration-frequency (DDF) method, especially for short-duration storms (such as 1-h). It results from occurrence probabilities of each rainstorm event and a different angle for rainfall frequency analysis, and could offer an alternative way of describing extreme rainfall properties and potentially help improve the hydrologic design of stormwater management facilities in urban areas.

One of the major reasons for the increasing impacts of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, cooperative greenhouse gas emission reduction schemes with a general consensus are needed in order to reduce the impacts of climate change. Due to the strong link between greenhouse gas emission and economic development there is disagreement among countries on the designing and implementation of emission reduction plans. In this paper the authors proposed a two-stage concession game to analyze emission reduction plans and determine a balanced emission range that improves the utilities of the bargaining parties. Furthermore the game was applied to a hypothetical example. Our results from the case study indicated that even though the utilities of the bargaining parties is highly affected by emission reductions, after making concessions their utilities can be improved given their emission reductions are within in a certain desirable range. The authors hope that this article provides insights which could be useful for understanding emission reduction plans and their consequences on the negotiating parties. nan;Concession game; Cooperation; Game theory; Greenhouse gas; Pareto improvement; Emission control; Game theory; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Concession game; Cooperation; Economic development; Emission range; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gases emissions; Pareto improvements; Climate change","Global warming and skiing: analysis of the future of skiing in the Aosta valley Purpose - This paper aims to examine the impact of global warming and climate change on skiing by assessing the costs that ski resorts would have to bear to address the lack of snow. In this way, new development models can be hypothesized for the regional economy in the Aosta Valley, territory located in the West Alps, whose economy is largely based on winter tourism. Design/methodology/approach - Starting with a literature review regarding global warming and its effects on the Alps, a methodology of analysis has been implemented to assess the relative weaknesses of ski resorts. Additional costs in adaptation strategies have been considered in the light of a major choice ski resorts must face: investing or not. For this analysis, four scenarios of global warming have been taken into consideration. Findings - The lack of snow due to a rise in temperatures will have a big impact on regional ski resorts and will seriously threaten the economy of small lateral valleys. In this scenario, it is important to think about reorganizing the regional ski supply by focusing on stations with better economic results and those strategically well located. In this way, we can safeguard winter tourism in the region and preserve skiing by concentrating costs only in those resorts that are also able to bear new cost adaptation strategies. Originality/value - The value of this paper is its estimation of the future impact of a rise in the average temperature in regional ski resorts. This impact is assessed in relation to concerns about the reduction of the skiing area and the new costs that ski companies will need to bear. The paper also proposes a new model for the reorganization of the ski supply in the Aosta Valley.

We construct four multivariate damage models for pluvial floods (caused by extreme rainfall) by differentiating on the one hand between ground floor floods and basement floods and on the other hand between damage to residential buildings and damage to housing contents. We do not only take into account the effect of flood-depth on damage, but also incorporate the effects of non-hazard indicators (building characteristics, behavioural indicators and socio-economic variables). By using a Tobit-estimation technique on identified victims of pluvial floods in Flanders (Belgium), we take into account the effect of cases of reported zero damage. Our results show that the flood depth is an important predictor of damage, but with a diverging impact between ground floor floods and basement floods. Also non-hazard indicators are important. For example being aware of the risk just before the water enters the building reduces content damage considerably, underlining the importance of warning systems and policy in this case of pluvial floods.

At the European level, the control of invasive alien species is a major goal of the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and a cornerstone, in this sense, is the Regulation (EU) no.l 43/2014 on invasive alien species. In this study, we focus on the Alpine and Continental biogeographical regions of Europe (defined in art. 1 of the Habitats Directive; 92/43/EEC), and aim to give an overview of the main protected forest habitat types threatened by invasive alien species, and focus on five major invasive alien tree species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Prunuss serotina, Quercus rubra, and Robiniapseudoacacia). We considered the assessment reports under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive for the period 2007-2012, and six documents on the interpretation of habitats, to identify those most threatened by invasive alien species and in particular by the five invasive alien trees. We also assessed selected examples of impacts by these alien tree species on different species groups within Natura 2000 sites to highlight potential effects on biodiversity. Riparian forest habitats and oak dominated woodlands are among the most prone to invasion within the two biogeographical regions. A altissima and R pseudoacacia are the most reported invasive alien trees in these protected forest habitat types. Furthermore, examples of the impacts of these tree species have indicated potential detrimental effects on forest habitats structure and functions, and on single species listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives. In conclusion, we emphasise the need for effective management and systematic monitoring of these five invasive alien tree species within Natura 2000 sites. ","Uncertainties in projecting climate-change impacts in marine ecosystems Projections of the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems are a key prerequisite for the planning of adaptation strategies, yet they are inevitably associated with uncertainty. Identifying, quantifying, and communicating this uncertainty is key to both evaluating the risk associated with a projection and building confidence in its robustness. We review how uncertainties in such projections are handled in marine science. We employ an approach developed in climate modelling by breaking uncertainty down into (i) structural (model) uncertainty, (ii) initialization and internal variability uncertainty, (iii) parametric uncertainty, and (iv) scenario uncertainty. For each uncertainty type, we then examine the current state-of-the-art in assessing and quantifying its relative importance. We consider whether the marine scientific community has addressed these types of uncertainty sufficiently and highlight the opportunities and challenges associated with doing a better job. We find that even within a relatively small field such as marine science, there are substantial differences between subdisciplines in the degree of attention given to each type of uncertainty. We find that initialization uncertainty is rarely treated explicitly and reducing this type of uncertainty may deliver gains on the seasonal-to-decadal time-scale. Weconclude that all parts of marine science could benefit from a greater exchange of ideas, particularly concerning such a universal problem such as the treatment of uncertainty. Finally, marine science should strive to reach the point where scenario uncertainty is the dominant uncertainty in our projections. climate change; initialization uncertainty; parametric uncertainty; projections; scenario uncertainty; structural uncertainty; uncertainty;COUPLED BIOLOGICAL/PHYSICAL MODELS; POPULATION BIOLOGY; SKILL ASSESSMENT; TRADE-OFFS; NORTH-SEA; STRATEGY; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; FISHERIES; FISH","The Economic Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture in Africa The African continent is projected to suffer adverse impacts from climate change, which are disproportionate to its contribution to global carbon dioxide emissions. Africa is particularly vulnerable because it is among the hottest places on the Earth and therefore any further warming will likely have adverse socioeconomic consequences; and most of the economies in this region rely mainly on natural resources and rain-fed agriculture, which are very sensitive to climate change and variability. This article investigates the impacts of climate change on African agriculture and discusses the policy implications for managing these impacts. The modelling results show that Africa will experience the largest impacts from climate change in terms of decline in economic growth and welfare losses. The disaggregated results show that Southern Africa will be the hardest hit region, followed by the Rest of sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and East Africa, in that order. There is therefore need for concerted efforts at adaptation, which should include introduction of temperature-sensitive varieties, diversification of production systems and livelihoods, shift to sustainable agricultural intensification, shift to irrigation agriculture, addressing institutional challenges such as poor physical and social infrastructure, market imperfections, lack of access to credit, and lack of crop insurance, etc. In the long run, emphasis should be placed on diversifying away from agriculture to industry and services. ","Think globally, act locally: Implementing the sustainable development goals in Montenegro Following the UN adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, the Government of Montenegro entered in the final phase of revising of National Strategy for Sustainable Development (NSSD 2030). Under the supervision of the National Council for Sustainable Development, Climate Change and Integrated Coastal Zone Management, an NSSD team of national and international experts was assembled under the coordination of the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism. To demonstrate commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda, Montenegro decided to center the NSSD 2030 on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), targets and indicators. One of the first UN member countries to implement the UN 2030 Agenda within the national policy context, Montenegro adopted its NSSD 2030 on July 7, 2016. As members of the NSSD team, here we 1) describe how the UN 2030 Agenda has been implemented within the policy context of Montenegro's NSSD 2030, and 2) focus on the identification of the NSSD 2030 monitoring and reporting framework. Our key finding is that 26 institutions will be handling data for assessing 137 out of the 241 (56.8%) SDG indicators in the first reporting period scheduled for 2019. Although the paper deals with the implementation of the SDGs in Montenegro and its implications, we believe it will be useful in informing other countries in their process of national transposition and operationalization of the UN 2030 Agenda.

This article will look at environmental security policies in Finland and Sweden and propose ways to develop more effective measures. It relies on a three-level framework that aims to enable the identification of environmental security impacts by categorising them into local, geopolitical and structural ones. The article will examine present environmental security strategies and policies in Finland and Sweden, consider their efficacy for addressing various kinds of impacts and point out approaches that are currently missing. Based on the discussion, it argues that a comprehensive policy approach is needed to tackle environmental security impacts. This requires closer coordination and interchange between sectors as well as strategic intent.

Contemporary environmental and social problems are complex and accompanied by uncertainty. Decisions must be made in the face of this uncertainty. In this address, geographers are encouraged to embrace, rather than minimize, complexity and uncertainty in their research and in their interactions with decision makers. Adaptation to climate change is used to illustrate the ubiquitous uncertainty surrounding problem solving and how the choice of assessment framework can overemphasize some sources of uncertainty and ignore others. A challenge is to communicate the information about complexity and uncertainty that decision makers need for robust and flexible decision making but at the same time prevent uncertainty from being equated with a lack of consensus and used as a reason for inaction. Geographers need to be open to a plurality of approaches to decision making and acknowledge uncertainty in their own research. Reframing the communication of uncertainty and the development of novel educational tools and learning materials for decision makers will facilitate decision making. Sustained engagement with decision makers, including the coproduction of knowledge, can also lead to greater consideration of complexity and uncertainty and to improved decision making.

This rapid urbanization increases the concentration of people and critical services in cities, which also upscale their exposure to acute shocks and long-term stresses such as floods, earthquakes, climate change or social dynamics. While all of these challenges are complex in themselves, in most cases, cities must face a combination of them. Resilience thinking demands cities plan holistically so that they are prepared for whatever shocks and stresses may arise. Although there is a set of frameworks aimed at building city resilience, frameworks specifically aimed at operationalizing the resilience-building process within cities remain undeveloped. This research begins to fill this gap by developing a Resilience Maturity Model (RMM) that provides cities with a roadmap for operationalizing the resilience-building process. For that purpose, the RMM defines a sequence of maturity stages and a set of policies that help cities to assess their current maturity stage and identify the policies that need to be implemented to improve their resilience level.

For example, about USD 900 billion should be invested annually in the energy sector up to 2030 to meet this target. Climate finance provides opportunities for investments in climate-smart projects. Such investments could enhance Africa's adaptive capacity, food security and economic growth. Nonetheless, Africa lags behind in the access and utilisation of these funds. Climate finance readiness plays a major role in enhancing access to these funds. This paper analyses policy and institutional frameworks that would enhance Kenya's readiness for climate finance. Publicly available scholarly articles, government and development partners reports were profiled using the following key words: Kenya, climate change, climate mitigation and climate adaptation. Then the keywords; climate finance, climate policy and legislation were used to identify the most relevant publications. These were reviewed to assess Kenya's readiness for climate finance. The study finds that considerable efforts have been made to enhance Kenya's readiness for climate finance as evidenced by the formulation of climate-related policies, legislation and the creation of institutions tasked to address climate change. Nonetheless, some policy areas could be enhanced. For instance, the role of the private sector could be better recognised and supported. This study provides an important reference for the government, development partners and private sector involved in negotiations and decision making on climate financing in Kenya. climate finance; climate investments; adaptation; mitigation; climate finance readiness;nan","Investigating afforestation and bioenergy CCS as climate change mitigation strategies The land-use sector can contribute to climate change mitigation not only by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but also by increasing carbon uptake from the atmosphere and thereby creating negative CO2 emissions. In this paper, we investigate two land-based climate change mitigation strategies for carbon removal: (1) afforestation and (2) bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage technology (bioenergy CCS). In our approach, a global tax on GHG emissions aimed at ambitious climate change mitigation incentivizes land-based mitigation by penalizing positive and rewarding negative CO2 emissions from the land-use system. We analyze afforestation and bioenergy CCS as standalone and combined mitigation strategies. We find that afforestation is a cost-efficient strategy for carbon removal at relatively low carbon prices, while bioenergy CCS becomes competitive only at higher prices. According to our results, cumulative carbon removal due to afforestation and bioenergy CCS is similar at the end of 21st century (600-700 GtCO(2)), while land-demand for afforestation is much higher compared to bioenergy CCS. In the combined setting, we identify competition for land, but the impact on the mitigation potential (1000 GtCO(2)) is partially alleviated by productivity increases in the agricultural sector. Moreover, our results indicate that early-century afforestation presumably will not negatively impact carbon removal due to bioenergy CCS in the second half of the 21st century. A sensitivity analysis shows that land-based mitigation is very sensitive to different levels of GHG taxes. Besides that, the mitigation potential of bioenergy CCS highly depends on the development of future bioenergy yields and the availability of geological carbon storage, while for afforestation projects the length of the crediting period is crucial. climate change mitigation; afforestation; bioenergy; carbon capture and storage; land-use modeling; land-based mitigation; carbon sequestration;LAND-USE; CROP PRODUCTIVITY; CARBON CAPTURE; STORAGE; ENERGY; FOOD; CONSERVATION; EMISSIONS; IMPACTS; TARGETS","Cost-Effective River Water Quality Management using Integrated Real-Time Control Technology Integrated real-time control (RTC) of urban wastewater systems is increasingly presented as a promising and emerging strategy to deliver improved surface water quality by responsive operation according to real-time data collected from the sewer system, treatment plant, and the receiving water. However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20% to meet the ""good status"" requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk. nan;GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; TREATMENT-PLANT; FLOW REGIME; SYSTEMS; STRATEGIES","From disappearing climates to climate hubs, the five classes of climate risk for wildlife refuges Context Climate change adaptive management strategies for isolated habitats such as wetlands are urgently needed. Conservation areas managed for wildlife refuges can be considered a network, permitting the tracking of current climate conditions within the network under projected future climates. Objectives We ask how many classes of temporal climate dynamics exist within a set of 48 refuges that comprise a network of conservation areas. Methods We identified the current-climate conditions of 48 US National Wildlife Refuges using their annual average of minimum temperature and annual precipitation. We then mapped the movement of analogous climates for each refuge from current to future-time periods under four climate projections. We identified distinct types of analog climate dynamics among the network of wildlife refuges that can inform climate-adaptive natural resource planning. Results We identified five analogous climate categories: (1) disappearing climates; (2) single-analogous climates; (3) multiple-analogous climates; (4) enduring climates; and (5) climate hubs, with some refuges occupying up to three classes. Using four climate projections, we found 10-25 refuges are climatically disappeared; 8-16 whose climate conditions appear in only one other unit; three whose current climate appears in many other refuges; three that are climatically stable; and four that are climate hubs. Conclusions The relative geographic isolation of refuges makes them particularly appropriate for use as nodes in a network-based climate assessment. The climate classification of the nodes can help inform selection from among multiple refuge management strategies based on their relative analogous climate dynamics. For example, new refuges could be identified to account for species inhabiting climatically disappearing refuges.

In the North Atlantic sector, there is strong decadal to multi-decadal climate variability. The most prominent internal mechanisms explaining the variability are the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). These affect also the climate variability in the Nordic region, but their impacts vary depending on local and regional conditions. The published studies also indicate that there appears to be potential for predictability of the decadal climate variations in the North Atlantic sector, mainly due to the AMOC variations. This also contributes to the predictability in the Nordic region, especially in the coastal areas adjacent to North Atlantic. The conclusions are uncertain at the moment, despite the fact that new knowledge is rapidly accumulating. Potential decadal predictability may generally be reduced due to global warming which is the largest over the high latitude oceans. For instance, weakening of the AMOC is generally noted in warmer world simulations. This may have consequences also on climate in the Nordic region, although the response is still uncertain. nan;NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; MERIDIONAL OVERTURNING CIRCULATION; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; THERMOHALINE CIRCULATION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION; INTERDECADAL VARIATIONS; PAST MILLENNIUM; PREDICTION; IMPACT; ENSEMBLE","Application of coupling model in optimizing city scale The rapid urbanization of China has enabled city scale optimization to become a research focus in various fields. At present, the most commonly used method in studying this topic is coefficient method, while dynamic and systemic analysis can rarely be seen. Advantages as well as disadvantages of system dynamic taken into consideration, this paper sets up a system dynamic-multi-objective programming coupling model to analyze optimum city scale. In the model, both quantification of sensitive parameters and modeling of complex systems can be realized. Coupling model is divided into four subsystems, and thus the causal feedback structure diagram of optimal city scale is built up. Furthermore, this paper makes a test on the consistency and the sensitivity of the coupling model, which is aimed to verify whether the model error is acceptable or not. Finally, the results show that the coupling model possesses high reliability and strong operability, which proves it's feasible to apply the coupling model in the study of city scale optimization.

This extinct shield volcano is characterized by steep slopes, intense precipitation, and fertile lands supporting a dense human population. As a result, landslides frequently cause damage and many fatalities. Apart from the need for a landslide susceptibility assessment, insight into the landslide mobilization rates [ton/km(2)/y] is required to assess the geomorphological importance of landslides. Such quantitative information is scarce for many regions around the world and particularly for Africa. We therefore compiled a calibration dataset of 653 landslides (514 slides and 139 rockfalls). Additionally, a second dataset of over 400 landslides was independently collected for validation purposes. To determine a logistic landslide susceptibility model, we used Monte Carlo simulations that selected different subsets of the calibration dataset to test the significance of the considered environmental variables. Susceptibility maps for all landslide types and for rockfalls were constructed for the Mount Elgon region in Uganda. In both maps, topography is by far the most significant factor controlling landslide susceptibility. Including lithology and soil moisture, further improved the model predictions. The models explain about 55% and 85% of the observed variance in landslide occurrence for all landslide types and for rockfalls respectively. The average calculated landslide frequency and mobilization rate for the landslide affected area are respectively 0.04landslides/km(2)/y and 750ton/km(2)/y. Landslide size is only weakly positively correlated with landslide susceptibility. Therefore, observed larger landslide mobilization rates correlating with higher landslide susceptibilities result from larger landslide numbers rather than from larger landslides. Our research highlights the relevance of detailed and long-term landslide mapping at the regional scale in data-scarce areas for regional planning and risk reduction strategies, as an improvement to continental and global susceptibility models, but also to assess the geomorphological importance of landslides as an erosion process.

Prioritizing Measures in the German Adaptation Strategy The German Adaptation Strategy launched a process to assess the consequences of climate change and identify key areas of adaptation measures. For its effective and efficient implementation it is important to set priorities based on generally recognized criteria. This paper proposes a cross-sectoral prioritization concept for assessing and selecting federal adaptation measures. Based on a literature review, five key criteria could be distinguished (strategic importance, urgency, side-effects, no-regret, flexibility), which were supplemented with criteria to assess the technical and socioeconomic feasibility (economical aspects, acceptance). The multicriteria approach enhances transparency and traceability of decision making in the adaptation process. Taking account of climate impacts (path 1) and prioritizing adaptation measures using the multi-criteria approach (path 2) constitute only a first step. Step 2 integrates the findings of path 1 and 2 to select appropriate measures for an Adaptation Action Plan.

This article explores the use of green infrastructure in climate change adaptation in London. A review of the current literature identifies how and where green infrastructure can deliver climate adaptation services and considers the benefits of taking a green infrastructure (or ecosystems services) approach to development. Selected examples are used to demonstrate how green infrastructure is being integrated into London's urban landscape. The article considers how existing mechanisms are facilitating the growth of green infrastructure in the capital and identifies three key focus areas for future research and policy. It concludes by suggesting that a more collaborative and imaginative approach to optimising the potential for green infrastructure benefits is needed. ecosystem services; climate change adaptation; green infrastructure;BENEFITS","Choosing the LID for Urban Storm Management in the South of Taiyuan Basin by Comparing the Storm Water Reduction Efficiency Low impact development (LID) is a storm management philosophy. This paper aims at choosing the LID for urban storm management by comparing the efficiency in the south urban district in the Taiyuan Basin. Firstly, we set up a 1D-2D model to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic process of the area. Then the efficiency of different LID scenarios was analyzed by ratio of surcharging pipeline, percentage of ponding road, external outflow, infiltration, surface runoff, facility storage, and LID area ratio. It was found that the continuous porous pavement and rain garden are beneficial for use in residential and commercial settings in urban areas, and the rain garden performs more effectively and efficiently than the continuous porous pavement. The area occupied by LID might be under 20% of the impervious building area, because the LID performance was not improved significantly with the LID area when the ratio exceeded 20%. The LIDs could be more useful for small return periods and short duration storms, and could not replace conventional runoff management practices and drainage systems. urban storm water management; low impact development; PCSWMM; rain garden; continuous porous pavement;LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; FLOOD RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; URBANIZATION; QUALITY; SYSTEM; RIVER; BMPS","Integrating economic measures of adaptation effectiveness into climate change interventions: A case study of irrigation development in Mwea, Kenya As climate change adaptation is becoming a recognized policy issue, the need is growing for quantitative economic evaluation of adaptation-related public investment, particularly in the context of climate finance. Funds are meant to be allocated not to any types of beneficial investments with or without climate change but to projects regarded as effective for climate change adaptation based on some metrics. But attempts at such project-specific evaluation of adaptation effects are few, in part because such assessments require an integration of various types of simulation analyses. Against this background, we conduct a case study of a Kenyan irrigation development project using a combination of downscaled climate data, runoff simulations, yield forecasting, and local socioeconomic projections to examine the effects of interventions specifically attributable to climate change adaptation, i.e., how much irrigation development can reduce the negative effects of climate change in the future. The results show that despite the uncertainties in precipitation trends, increased temperatures due to climate change have a general tendency to reduce rice yields, and that irrigation development will mitigate income impacts from the yield loss-for example, for the median scenario, the household income loss of 6% in 2050 due to climate change without irrigation development is flipped to become positive with the project. This means that the irrigation development project will likely be effective as a means for climate change adaptation. nan;AFRICA; CONSTRAINTS; IMPACTS; RISKS","And yet it moves! (Climate) migration as a symptom in the Anthropocene ""While the climate-migration nexus raises crucial questions of mobility and climate justice, it is commonly understood through simplistic narratives that reify a complex set of relations. The spectre of environmentally-induced exodus is recurrent in media, policy and activist circles, in spite of numerous studies that reveal the empirical flaws and noxious normative implications of such narratives. This article explores this insistence and the desire(s) for there to be a reified relation between climate and migration such insistence reveals. The article proceeds in three movements. First, it situates discourses on climate migration in relation to the crisis of humanism the Anthropocene signifies. Second, it operates a symptomatic reading of climate migration discourses, drawing on two understandings of symptom elaborated by Lacan - as 'return of the repressed' and as 'Sinthome'. Read as a symptom, the figure of the climate migrant/refugee appears as the return of fundamental contradictions that carve contemporary regimes of socioecological (re)production. Through the concept of 'Sinthome', discourses on climate migration can be read as (illusory) attempts to shore up for the waning consistence of modern forms of 'being human'. Finally, the article proposes a symptomatic reading of the Anthropocene itself, and elaborates on what the dissolution of this symptom/ Sinthome would entail.""

Further insights can be obtained from studying the impact of temperature and heat index (HI) for Jaipur city's all-cause mortality. The objective of this work was to assess the association between the extreme heat (daily maximum temperature, daily minimum temperature, daily mean temperature, relative humidity and HI) and all-cause mortality for summer months (March to June) from 2006 to 2015 for urban population of Jaipur. For summer months, we collected the data on various temperature and all-cause mortality parameters for at least 10 years. The student's t-test and ANOVA were used to analyse variations in mean temperature, maximum temperature and HI. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the relationship between ambient heat and lag time effect all-cause mortality. A total of 75,571 deaths (all-cause mortality) for 1,203 summer days (2006-2015) were analysed in relation to temperature and relative humidity. The mean daily all-cause mortality has been estimated at 62.8 +/- 15.2 for the study period. There is a significant increase of 39% per day all-cause mortality at the maximum temperature of 45 degrees C and above. However only 10% rise per day all-cause mortality for extreme danger days (HI > 54 degrees C). The mean daily all-cause mortality shows a significant association with daily maximum temperature (F = 34.6, P < .0001) and HI (discomfort index) from caution to extreme danger risk days (F = 5.0, P < .0019). The lag effect of extreme heat on all-cause mortality for the study period (2006 to 2015) was at a peak period on the same day of the maximum temperature (r = 0.245 at P < .01) but continues up to four days. The study concludes that the effect of ambient heat on all-cause mortality increase is clearly evident (rise of 39% deaths/day). Accordingly, focus should be put on developing adaptation measures against ambient heat. This analysis may satisfy policy makers' needs. Extreme heat-related mortality needs further study to reduce adverse effects on health among Jaipur's urban population.

Previous studies have shown the benefits of streamflow forecasts in improving optimized objective performance of reservoir operating rules. This study demonstrates a simple method for incorporating publicly available streamflow forecast information in operational planning for a water grid. Multiobjective optimization is used to find operating rules for a case study that are optimal for three management objectivesmaximizing minimum system storage, minimizing operational cost, and minimizing spills from reservoirsand for forecast inflow scenarios. These forecast-optimized rules are compared to those optimized using inflow scenarios from the historical distribution, representing operation in the absence of forecast information. The results across four seasonal (3-month) planning periods indicate that, on average, operating rules optimized using forecast streamflow information perform slightly better in terms of the management objectives than those optimized using historical inflow information. Using multiple scenarios of inflow that span the forecast distribution increases the robustness of the operating rules and reduces the risk of underperformance because of forecast inaccuracy. The results suggest that incorporating streamflow forecast information into multiobjective simulation-optimization has the potential to provide improvements in seasonal operating rules for a water grid.

Various limitations inherent to participatory processes concerning NBS for inclusive urban regeneration have been addressed, and lessons have been learnt. This paper investigates participation and urban regeneration and focuses on the development of guidelines for citizen engagement and the co-creation of NBS in the H2020 URBiNAT project. The methodology first involves the collection of scientific and practical input on citizen engagement from a variety of stakeholders, such as researchers and practitioners, to constitute a corpus of qualitative data. This input is then systematized into guideline categories and serves as the basis for a deeper analysis with researchers, experts, and practitioners, both inside and outside URBiNAT, and in dialogue with other cases of participatory NBS implementation. The results highlight an 'ecology of knowledges' based on a 'living' framework, which aims to address the specific needs of various segments of citizens and to match citizen engagement to the participatory cultures of cities. Implications and further research are also discussed, with a special focus on the implementation of NBS. The conclusions broaden the research context to include the refinement of the NBS approach, with participation being seen as both a means and an end. guidelines; citizen engagement; co-creation; nature-based solutions; participation; urban regeneration; living knowledge; URBiNAT;CLIMATE-CHANGE; PARTICIPATION; ADAPTATION","Climate urbanism as critical urban theory As urban actors engage in climate action, their projects - from urban greening to changes in urban energy systems - reshape not just the urban built environment but also the organization of social life. This new climate urbanism invites to reimagine what it means to be urban in a climate-changed world. We propose the articulation of climate urbanism as a critical theory that both exposes the production of further inequalities associated with urban responses to climate change and provides new radical forms of practice for more progressive urban futures under climate change.

Risk aversion significantly increases crop diversification strategies of households but marginally reduces herbicide use by households. Market risk significantly increases the use of improved seed varieties and the application of inorganic fertiliser but reduces diversification into livestock production. Production risk largely increases diversification into livestock production. Farmers' risk management strategies are affected by socioeconomic variables such as access to extension services, area cultivated, age and gender. Policy effort focused on building pliable on-farm crop related risk management strategies should aim at considering the risk aversion and the perception of market risk whilst those focused on livestock should focus on production risk.

Children are among the most vulnerable groups when disasters occur, yet their voices in disaster risk reduction are rarely heard. Using a qualitative methodology, this article examines the extent to which children are involved in disaster risk reduction in Muzarabani District, Zimbabwe. Despite evidence of the potential positive impact that children can have on DRR, their involvement in risk reduction planning in Zimbabwe is negligible. To achieve greater resilience to disasters requires that children's voices are heard and recognized as central to improved disaster risk reduction.

Given that the impacts of climate change are experienced at local scales, it makes sense that adaptation should occur locally, and yet, despite this, locals often have little control over how adaptation is funded, designed and delivered in order to climate-proof their places and futures. Increasingly competitive access to funding and limited progress towards sustainable adaptation outcomes prompts our call to rethink adaptation at the local scale. Drawing from grounded research with locals, we explore three case examples from the Asia-Pacific region, ranging from the coastal belt of Bangladesh, to a peri-urban informal settlement in the Philippines, and to a small rural island in Vanuatu. These examples help illustrate how locally led adaptation (LLA) gives us hope for more equitable, effective and sustainable adaptation outcomes. We show how LLA can help to reduce dependency and support local autonomy, diverse capabilities and creativity. We propose nine mutually reinforcing drivers of LLA to improve grassroots initiatives. These drivers focus on locally led decision-making, local strengths and resources (e.g. institutions, social networks, local knowledge and coping mechanisms), local realities, local vulnerability contexts and inequalities, local metrics for measuring ""success"", and local agendas which should be supported or enabled by external agencies. These drivers support local people to determine their own adaptation futures and ensure finite funding resources are utilised in meaningful ways.

Agroforestry systems are credited for stocking significant amounts of carbon and hence have a potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Forestry-based carbon storage projects are currently being introduced in many tropical countries, but assessment of carbon storage is difficult due to a lack of species-level information.The research addressed in this paper assessed above, belowground and litter biomass of Theobroma cacao (cocoa) and Tectona grandis(teak) plantations relative to secondary forests in two sites in mid-western Cote d'Ivoire. Allometric equations for tropical trees relating to diameter at breast height (DBH) were used to estimate carbon storage potential. The main findings reveal that teak plantations have an appreciably much greater mean carbon storage capacity than secondary forests and cocoa plantations. The aboveground biomass of teak stands contained the highest carbon stock (214.7 Mg C ha(-1)) while litter and root displayed 2.8 and 35.6 Mg C ha(-1), respectively. Cocoa plantations have the lowest carbon storage potential in the aboveground biomass,estimated at 18.6 Mg C ha(-1), but a considerable amount of carbon stored in the litter (4.7 Mg C ha(-1)). With teak plantations' annual mean storage rate of 19.5 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), corresponding to 70.6 Mg CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), the results demonstrate teak's potential of carbon sequestration and mitigation of the greenhouse gas emission effect.

A fast and efficient way to overcome these stresses under the prism of a sustainable crop management is the use of grafting, combining the desired cultivar with the rootstock providing tolerances to abiotic stresses. Our aim was to validate three accessions previously selected for their tolerances to salt and water stresses (A25, B14 and C12) as rootstocks, in real field conditions. The physiological and productive behavior of the commercial pepper 'Adige' (A) grafted onto these accessions was compared along the growing cycle with this cultivar grafted onto the commercial rootstock 'Antinema' (ANT) and with the ungrafted pepper plant (A). Under water and salt stress, grafted plants onto the selected accessions, gave higher marketable yields than ungrafted plants or that plants grafted onto ANT, particularly the A25 accession. This rootstock was able to maintain high photosynthesis levels under stressing conditions through different adjustments made in the physiological processes, such as proline accumulation. The ANT rootstock showed comparable yields to A25 in control conditions. Under salt stress, Na+ and Cl- were equally accumulated in A/A25 plants and the ungrafted ones, but A/ANT, A/B14 and A/C12 were more restrictive in their absorption along the growing season. These results reinforce the idea that the use of tolerant pepper rootstocks is a good adaptation strategy for abiotic stressing conditions. The results also suggest that the abiotic stress was alleviated by the lack of negative effects mainly on photosynthesis, which maintained plant growth and the marketable yield.

Here, we move beyond the all-too-common narrative about integrating or incorporating (too often used as euphemisms for assimilating) other knowledge systems into Western science, instead of building an ethic of knowledge coexistence and complementarity in knowledge generation using Two-Eyed Seeing as a guiding framework. Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumkin Mi'kmaw) embraces ""learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all,"" as envisaged by Elder Dr. Albert Marshall. In this paper, we examine the notion of knowledge dichotomies and imperatives for knowledge coexistence and draw parallels between Two-Eyed Seeing and other analogous Indigenous frameworks from around the world. It is set apart from other Indigenous frameworks in its explicit action imperative-central to Two-Eyed Seeing is the notion that knowledge transforms the holder and that the holder bears a responsibility to act on that knowledge. We explore its operationalization through three Canadian aquatic and fisheries case-studies that co-develop questions, document and mobilize knowledge, and co-produce insights and decisions. We argue that Two-Eyed Seeing provides a pathway to a plural coexistence, where time-tested Indigenous knowledge systems can be paired with, not subsumed by, Western scientific insights for an equitable and sustainable future. co-production; Etuaptmumk; indigenous knowledge; knowledge coexistence; pluralism; Western science;CLIMATE-CHANGE; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; SUSTAINABILITY; PERSPECTIVES; INTEGRATION; COMANAGEMENT; RETHINKING; ONTOLOGIES; STRESSORS","The Challenging Paths to Net-Zero Emissions: Insights from the Monitoring of National Policy Mixes To achieve its ambitious climate targets, the European Union (EU) must adopt new policies, increase the impact of existing policies and/or remove dysfunctional ones. The EU has developed an elaborate system to monitor national policy mixes in order to support these challenging requirements. Data that member states have reported to the EU over the last ten years reveal that the average expected per-policy-instrument emission reduction has declined, while national policy mixes have remained generally stable over time. This is strikingly discordant with the EU's ambitious commitment to become carbon neutral by 2050 ('net zero'). climate policy; policy monitoring; policy mixes; policy change; policy sectors; EU;ADMINISTRATIVE DATA; BIG DATA; CLIMATE; LESSONS","A framework for assessing adaptive capacity to multiple climatic and non climatic stressors in small-scale fisheries As climate change and other socio-economic stressors continue to impact coastal social-ecological systems, we need to deepen our knowledge of the capacity to adapt. Global environmental change research has generated several useful concepts and frameworks for understanding and assessing adaptive capacity to climate change impacts, but our ability to effectively integrate and use this wealth of knowledge to mobilise and build the needed adaptive capacity remains low. We build on the capitals and the vulnerability frameworks to develop a new framework to argue for how existing frameworks and concepts can be consolidated for assessing adaptive capacity, how adaptive capacity can be mobilised and the need to assess adaptive capacity in the context of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors. The framework adds three important insights into the studies of adaptive capacity. First, it recognises that links among various forms of capital (components of adaptive capacity) are critical for mobilising, building or depleting adaptive capacity. Second, it explicitly shows adaptive capacity is better understood when assessed in the context of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors because the impacts of climate change are bound to manifest in complex coupled human and social systems. Third, it highlights that knowledge of multiple interactions among stressors provides a strong explanation for tackling some inherent developmental issues with climate change adaptation plans and actions. Evidence from smallscale coastal fisheries of Ghana supports the framework's assumptions and arguments.

Evaluating emergent social learning processes in the Zambezi basin Social learning in collaborative processes is considered important for addressing complex natural resource dilemmas and for supporting multi-actor interactions in joint problem framing, and the co-construction of solutions. While social learning is often presented as a normative approach for stimulating shared understanding among multiple actors, little is known about how long-term emergent social learning processes occur. In this paper, we analyse a long-term emergent social learning process within transboundary river basin management. To this end, we apply the concept of the learning space - meaning arenas for interaction, deliberation and reframing - as a lens for evaluating emergent social learning processes. Results show that in the Zambezi Basin, social learning in emergent processes occurs in stages and is triggered by various factors that result in collective outcomes throughout the process. Emergent social learning processes were triggered by structural reorganization processes, natural calamities, the influences of cooperating partners and international frameworks. Over time, the spaces for interaction and deliberation led to the reframing of basin management practices and the subsequent development of new institutions. In addition, social learning outcomes included increased relational capacities of national and regional actors and trust, but also mistrust and power issues. While emergent long-term processes are difficult to evaluate, our findings reveal that the concept of the learning space provides a structure for assessing long-term emergent social learning process outcomes, and thus, can provide a broader understanding of processes needed in designing long-term management practices or institutions.

The present study has detected trends in annual and cropping seasonal rainfall and temperature data for the period of 1961-2011 using Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Spearman's rho (SR) test and modified Mann-Kendall test that has been applied to the significant lag-1 serial correlated time series data, and slope has been estimated using Sen's Slope estimator for twelve meteorological stations located in the western part of Bangladesh covering about 41 % of the country. Almost 71 % trends explored by MK test in annual rainfall are statistically insignificant, and SR test also complies it. The spatial distribution of rainfall trend shows insignificant positive trends in major part of the area. Significant positive trends both by MK test and by SR test at 95 % confidence levels are observed at rates of 8.56, 11.15 and 13.66 mm/year at Dinajpur, Rangpur and Khepupara stations, respectively, and the Kharif season rainfall of these stations also shows significant increasing trends except Dinajpur. On the other hand, significant decreasing trends in annual rainfall are found at Bhola (-11.67 mm/year) and Rajshahi (-5.951 mm/year) stations and decreasing trends in rainfall dominated the Pre-Kharif season over the area. But, 83.33 % of the stations show rising trends in annual mean temperature with significant positive trends (as observed by both MK test and SR test) at Rangpur, Bogra, Faridpur, Jessore and Bhola stations where the rate of changes vary from 0.013 C/year at Faridpur to 0.08 C/year at Bhola. Most of the trends in Rabi and Pre-Kharif seasons of mean temperatures are not statistically significant. However, all stations except Barisal show significant rising trends in temperature in Kharif season. To cope with this changing pattern of rainfall and temperature, effective adaptation strategies should be taken to keep up the agricultural production that is related to livelihood of the most people and to ensure the country's food security. nan;Western part of Bangladesh","Emotion and the Psychological Distance of Climate Change Anchored by construal level theory and appraisal theories of emotion, this study examines whether discrete emotions vary along with perceived psychological distance of climate change impacts. We found that reduced psychological distance perception led to an increase in concrete emotions such as anger, fear, sadness, and guilt. In contrast, increased psychological distance perception led to an increase in hope-an abstract emotion. Compared to anger, anxiety, and hope, fear, guilt, and shame had more limited impact on climate mitigation action and policy support.

Recent advancements and developments on power electronic technologies have enabled the renewable energy sources to be grid-connected with gradually higher penetration in island electricity supply. Consequently, the utilization and efficiency of renewable energy resources in islands has received remarkable attention from both the academia and industry. In this paper, a brief overview on the current status of island energy resources is described. Then, the existing utilization status and development potential of various renewable generations for island power grids, including solar, wind, hydropower, biomass, ocean and geothermal energy, are investigated. Furthermore, the advanced technologies to improve the penetration level of island renewables, including energy storage techniques, hybrid renewable energy system, microgrid, demand side management, distributed generation and smart grid, are presented.

When understood descriptively, it usefully supplements other conceptions like reciprocity (e.g., between healthcare providers and their patients), patient-centered medicine, or care ethics. In the context of health insurance (especially in Europe), an appeal to solidarity effectively addresses the problem of the motivation for taking seriously the medical needs of compatriots by emphasizing shared vulnerabilities and needs. If understood more broadly as human solidarity, the notion proposes attention to the health of distant others, as a condition of their dignity. And taken normatively, it fills in some of the requirements of the abstract norms of justice and equality by advocating 'standing with' or aiding fellow community members or possibly also distant others in regard to their medical needs. Solidarity may be understood be required either for its own sake, when taken as a separate norm, or as a way to realize the demands of justice and equal treatment in matters of health. The current focus on solidarity in the healthcare literature is useful and important, in my view. Yet, to my mind, the understanding of it tends to be unduly restricted. For one thing, the literature has most often focused on solidarity within nation-states, as a relation among compatriots that supports universal healthcare. The notion is also seen as having import for contemporary developments like large health databases, biobanks, personalized medicine, and organ donation. A few authors extend solidarity more widely, particularly in interpreting the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, with its reference to solidarity in Article 13 and its implication in some other articles. Yet, these various uses of the conception of solidarity in healthcare have thus far tended to either disregard or even to actively eschew its traditional meanings of labor solidarity or social movement solidarity, or indeed, any use of the term that posits an 'other' against which solidarity might be practiced (although it is generally recognized that the concept is bounded and particular). I suggest that the neglect of some important historical (and contemporary) senses of solidarity-and especially social movement solidarity-leads to a blind spot in the current bioethical theories. An alternative reading of solidarity in healthcare drawing on social movement and labor contexts would highlight a crucial dimension of contemporary healthcare provision, namely, structural injustice. Systemic forms of injustice militate against adequate healthcare for all, and suggest the need for solidaristic action to struggle against and to remedy existing entrenched inequalities. Omitting an account of structural injustice and even of justice itself from the core meaning of solidarity leads, I argue, to a rather weak and too easy sense of what solidarity requires, and is ill suited to serve as an adequate normative guide for improving healthcare in the present. This is the case most obviously in regard to healthcare in the United States with its unequal health system, but I suggest it applies more generally and even in Europe, and certainly if we take the obligations of solidarity to extend transnationally. While traditional notions of solidarity within existing communities and nation-states remain significant, I believe that an adequate conception of solidarity needs to show how it is connected to justice. It also needs to extend transnationally, given our increasingly interconnected world, which raises difficult questions of the relation between national and transnational solidarities, and the justifications we can give for prioritizing the health and healthcare of those closer to us. In this essay, I will begin by briefly indicating how the existing approaches to solidarity in healthcare, despite their trenchant analyses of many of its features and applications, remain abstract and without sufficient critical import by not directly considering the impact of structural injustices. I will then attempt to sketch how an understanding of institutional barriers to equal treatment, along with the commitment to achieving justice concretely, need to inform not only our application of solidarity in practice but also our understanding of the core meaning of solidarity itself. I will not be able to address here the complex question of the priority that is often given to the needs of those close to us and the related question of negotiating our obligations to engage in national vs. transnational solidarity efforts, but I have taken this up in other work. In a series of books and articles, Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx have taken the lead in calling attention to the relevance of the concept of solidarity for bioethics. They have articulated a general conception and sketched several potential implications for healthcare and bioethics more widely. They advance the following definition: 'Solidarity is an enacted commitment to carry ""costs"" (financial, social, emotional, or otherwise) to assist others with whom a person or persons recognize similarity in a relevant respect.' Prainsack and Buyx usefully develop the notion of solidarity as a practice and see it as operating within three domains: the interpersonal, the group, and the administrative/legal. Their conception is largely descriptive, although it has some normative preconditions, and involves what they call axiological/axiomatic normativity of some sort. The difficulty of this latter phrase aside, Prainsack and Buyx seem willing to countenance morally negative expressions of solidarity (e.g., among members of a gang or even a terror group) in the interest of preserving the analytic utility of the concept. Moreover, they sharply distinguish solidarity from justice, regarding the latter as deontic and thus as not part of the concept of solidarity itself. But given their attention to the context of the practice of solidarity, they expect that norms like justice would be brought to bear, presumably to qualify the practice of solidarity. Since Prainsack and Buyx's approach is perhaps the most highly developed conception of solidarity in the bioethics literature, it can serve as a useful foil for elaborating my own account, drawing on and extending my previous work on this theme. The main strength of their approach, it seems to me, lies in its aptness for understanding solidarity as a group practice, and especially within nation-states. Indeed, their view, with its emphasis on bearing costs to assist others within a group, seems to line up primarily with what has been called a 'civic solidarity' conception, one that has been prominent in connection with European welfare states. The idea that solidarity can come to be entrenched administratively and legally also points to the dominance of that European model in their understanding (though their conception is supplemented with what they call interpersonal solidarity). Importantly, these authors' emphasis on solidarity as a practice helpfully ties solidarity to action. They suggest that this action orientation serves to distinguish solidarity from empathy or other sentiments. However, the centrality in their account of bearing 'costs' with the aim of assisting others brings the model close to the Christian tradition of solidarity with its emphasis on relieving suffering and aiding the poor. Their perspective likewise focuses on individual activity in aiding others, rather than on collective action. (The term 'costs', however, has financial connotations that do not sit altogether easily with this religious perspective.) The Christian tradition of solidarity can be distinguished (at least in its older forms) from the alternative socialist tradition of labor union solidarity, where solidarity is aimed at promoting shared interests and overcoming domination and exploitation with the aim of achieving justice. In this article, I will suggest that this latter understanding of solidarity introduces an important normative aspect of the concept of solidarity, one that is largely lacking in Prainsack and Buyx's account. Although Prainsack and Buyx are at pains to differentiate between solidarity and charity (which is indeed an important distinction), I find their argument on this point unconvincing. They claim that charity is marked by assistance for others who are perceived as 'different' from oneself, rather than as being 'similar in a relevant respect.' The problem is that this distinction could be seen as having a question-begging aspect, inasmuch as the authors seem to posit by definition that in cases where people choose to donate to charities for people with a similar condition to their own (e.g., a particular illness), they are in fact acting in solidarity rather than charity. At the very least, more argument would be needed to establish the difference in question. Indeed, the issue of what is perceived as 'similar' and what counts as 'a relevant respect,' remains rather vague in their account. Clearly, perceptions of similarity and difference are notably various and variable. Can the perception of similarity with another in a relevant respect always be explained in a way that itself makes no reference to the solidarity that is supposed to follow from it, as it would have to be to avoid circularity? Is it, for example, the abstract status of being a fellow citizen that generates solidarity or does our tie to these others already presuppose pre-existing solidarities, e.g., as being members of our nation? The account would need to explicitly address questions such as these and also explicate what counts as 'similar in a relevant respect' to concretize this notion and give it real utility. In my own view, as developed elsewhere and as will become clear below, the distinction of solidarity from charity turns rather on the connection that solidarity bears to justice, and to the overcoming of domination and exploitation. It can also be seen to involve reciprocity in a sense to be indicated, which charity does not. Indeed, Prainsack and Buyx sharply distinguish between solidarity and reciprocity, taking the latter in the narrow sense of what I have elsewhere called instrumental reciprocity or 'tit for tat' reciprocity. In my view, reciprocity is a fundamental social relation that in fact takes several forms besides such instrumental ones, and I believe that reciprocity remains important for properly understanding solidarity. This potential for reciprocity helps to distinguish solidarity from charity, since charity evidently does not presuppose reciprocation from the needy or those aided. The reciprocity that applies to solidarity actions can be seen in the notion of mutual aid, which has been part of traditional understandings of labor and social movement solidarity. The mutuality involved here is itself a developed form of reciprocity, but one characterized not instrumentally in the manner of Prainsack and Buyx. Rather, reciprocity and the solidarity that incorporates it are here seen as aiming at improving the situation of the other, at least partly for its own sake, and not only for the subsequent return of benefit that could be expected from doing so. Although they do not explicitly tie solidarity to the overcoming of domination and exploitation, Prainsack and Buyx do helpfully take note of the dangers for healthcare posed by commercial interests, as well as entrenched inequalities. This is evident, for example, in their account of the problems that afflict the use of large databases and biobanks, as well as the perils that attend some proposed uses of personalized medicine. But these problematic dimensions of contemporary life are treated more as background conditions rather than as structural and institutional features against which solidarity actions with others need to struggle. Moreover, we can observe that the prevalence of commercial interests in regard to health databases can undercut the very possibilities for solidarity that these authors seek, by deterring people from contributing their information to them from fear of such commercial use. This lends an additional practical motivation to taking these structural background conditions seriously, if solidarity is to be encouraged. Certainly, these authors are right to highlight forms of solidarity that may arise in pursuit of common aims or shared goals, as within a political community (often taken as national). But I would suggest that solidarity is also centrally a process aimed at overcoming forms of domination and structural injustice, where people share an interest in doing so. This struggle against domination can sometimes itself take an instrumental form. But when it involves normative solidarity, it is properly understood as motivated by a shared interest in justice rather than simply the pursuit of benefits. As I have suggested, the classic account of solidarity in this sense is that of labor movement solidarity, but similar notions have characterized a range of social movements, e.g., in Latin America and elsewhere, whether aimed at agrarian reform or at overcoming authoritarian rule, where they take the form also of democratic movements. I propose that these examples, with the processive and critical notion of solidarity they imply, have implications for an adequate conception of solidarity for healthcare and for its applications there. Before turning to this socially critical notion of solidarity, we can note a drawback in the standard reading that takes solidarity as a unitary notion within a single group or community like the nation-state. Insofar as the group is limited to compatriots, or to members of smaller pre-existing groups, it evidently does not address the needs or vulnerabilities of others situated outside these groups' borders. Although there may be unitary groups or communities that are transnational, within which traditional forms of solidarity can be found, increasingly we see that cross-border or transnational relationships take a networked form and involve relations to 'outsiders'. What sorts of solidarities are possible there both generally and in the context of healthcare? Some bioethicists have recently addressed this issue by introducing a notion of human solidarity or global solidarity. In the analysis given by Gunson, the notion of solidarity held to be suitable for global contexts and seen as underlying the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights is explicitly understood as 'weak solidarity,' namely, 'the willingness to take the perspective of others seriously.' It does not add the requirement 'to act in support of it,' which he holds is characteristic of 'strong solidarity,' such as is involved in political solidarities or in social movements to counter exploitation or achieve justice. Gunson explicates weak solidarity as involving listening to others and 'caring for others,' but not necessarily as including efforts at reducing inequalities, or even a specific concern with those. He sees the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights as appealing to a notion of human dignity, but seems to think that weak solidarity is sufficient to respect and uphold that dignity. I would suggest that the appropriate sense of dignity is the robust and demanding one that we find explicitly enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is taken in an egalitarian sense, and is held to imply certain labor rights, along with health itself as a human right. A related notion of dignity is likewise appealed to numerous times in the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, which also includes a specific reference to solidarity, as a goal of international cooperation, along with demands on governments for meeting health research and healthcare needs. But this Declaration could usefully go further to specify some of the practices that would help to realize these aims, and I suggest that strong, rather than weak, forms of solidarity would be required in order to fulfill them, and not merely the caring for and aiding others that Gunson and also Prainsack and Buyx emphasize in their accounts. We can distinguish two main senses of solidarity, as already adumbrated, each of which has import for healthcare and the structural injustice that may constrain it. One sense is unitary solidarity, often taken as pertaining to the relations among citizens within a state, but applying as well to the relations among members of smaller pre-existing groups. The second is what I call networking solidarity, evident when groups (often, though not necessarily, transnational), or sometimes also individuals, link up to work on projects aimed at overcoming oppression or exploitation. The first form of solidarity-unitary group solidarity-is often illustrated with the motto of the three musketeers: 'One for all and all for one,' but that is a rather specific and highly demanding version of it. Nonetheless, it has the advantage of calling attention to solidarity as involving a clear awareness of a 'we' or 'us'. Although some sense of a 'we' can be discerned in both forms of solidarity analyzed here, it applies to each type somewhat differently, as we shall see. In contrast, the individualist approach to solidarity advanced by Prainsack and Buyx tends to diminish the role of shared or collective activity, although it helpfully includes a notion of identification with an other who in their view are aided because they are regarded as 'similar in some respect.' In the account that I have developed, the first sense of solidarity pertains to relations among co-participants in an ongoing group, oriented to shared goals. Not all of the participants necessarily share all the goals of the group though they are generally committed to the main ones and to the group's persistence and viability as a whole. Note that solidarity here may not always require a pre-existing shared identity or culture (although it often does), but may emerge from the constitution of an ongoing 'we' in the context of collective or group agency. The shared goals of the group are not aggregative, that is, a sum of each individual's similar goals, but arise in common endeavors (normally including a multiplicity of overlapping subordinate goals), where the overarching goals are at least partly constitutive of the group itself. The various aims and goals are not always explicitly reflected on and are often embedded or institutionalized in the practices of the group. While such a conception of solidarity is often thought to be merely descriptive, I see it (as will be the case for the second sense as well) as grounded in a social ontology of what I have called individuals-in-relations, and as having normative dimensions. In this first case of group solidarity, as an instance of what I have elsewhere called 'common activities,' the norms go beyond the commitments involved in the constitution of any group whatever, and extend to the recognition (though often only implicit) of the fundamentally equal status of the individuals who constitute the group as agents. In virtue of this equality, I have argued elsewhere that the members should be granted equal rights to participate in processes of affirming and revising the goals of the group and should also have some say in how the various shared goals are carried out. This follows from an understanding of justice as what I have termed 'equal positive freedom,' or prima facie equal rights to the conditions of self-development, where such social contexts of activity are among these necessary conditions for individuals. In virtue of their equal agency, no individual has a right to dominate others in determining these common activities, that is, they have equal rights of co-determination of them. In this perspective, solidarity can be seen as an integral part of a set of norms that encompasses justice, as requiring the equal freedom of these relational individuals to develop themselves over time, and the norm of democracy, going beyond its traditional meanings of voting and majority rule to include equal rights of participation in co-determining group ends. In this account, which emphasizes people's interdependence and their embodied nature, the sort of mutual support involved in group solidarity emerges as a crucial condition for the self-transformative activity of individuals and for the persistence of the group itself. We can say then that the requirement to realize justice along with a broad range of human rights through solidaristic activity arises from people's interdependence and from the fact that their free development as agents requires a set of conditions, both material and social. Justice calls for the protection of the traditionally recognized negative liberties, but goes beyond it to require the availability of conditions that support people's self-developing activity (both as individuals and as collectives) over time, that is, their positive freedom. Crucial among these conditions are health and healthcare, as well as education and other central social needs. Given the individuals' fundamental equality as agents, with both individual dignity and shared needs, the norm of justice as requiring action to realize equality not only qualifies any potential group solidarity, as it does on the Prainsack and Buyx account, but is properly a core aspect of solidarity itself as a normative practice. From this perspective, the solidarities that obtain within a group not only help to realize justice concretely, but also can be said to constitute 'the other side of justice' (in Habermas's phrase). Solidarity actions not only reflect people's pre-existing feelings of connection to each other, but also can function in practice to solidify their understanding of shared neediness and their interdependence in meeting these needs and pursuing shared goals. The interdependence involved in common endeavors like political communities, together with the equal vulnerability of members of such communities, involves forms of reciprocity and gives rise to the requirement of mutual aid that is characteristic of solidarity. Further, the conditions for the realization of both individual freedom and of the shared goals of the group can in fact be seen to require the absence of domination and exploitation, that is, the overcoming of these one-sided forms of recognition not only in interpersonal relations, but also as they are entrenched in structural or institutional forms. Included here are types of economic functioning that systematically disadvantage large groups of people, along with other forms of institutional discrimination on the basis of race or gender, or other minority characteristics. Although existing solidarity groups are not always fully aware of the relevance to them of overcoming such injustices, I believe that such demands of justice are in fact integral to solidarity as a norm and not external to it, as on the empirically oriented account advanced by Prainsack and Buyx. Moreover, we can see that ongoing (and not merely pre-given) solidaristic social action within a collectivity and community is needed as a way to more fully achieve justice within it. These interrelations between solidarity and justice are even more evident in the second sense of solidarity, which I have called networking solidarities. This second form is most often found in social movements. Conceptually it arises primarily from classic notions of labor solidarity, which I have suggested can be extended to these movements and can even characterize the relations that are increasingly evident among civil society associations, e.g., NGOs. Networking solidarity is a form particularly apt for capturing constructive relations of support toward distantly situated others, but it can also apply within, as well as across, borders. This form of solidarity is generally aimed at overcoming forms of domination and exploitation, but may also include networking to help alleviate suffering. As a relation among groups (or sometimes even among individuals), I have elsewhere argued that it manifests a type of social empathy or the understanding of another group's situation and perspective, but such solidarity does not consist in sentiment per se. Rather, it necessarily involves action or a readiness to take action on behalf of, and in support of, others. Here, too, there is generally a commitment to a common cause, and when properly understood, I think, a commitment to justice. Although this form of solidarity in practice has tended to involve better-off people working to help those who are less advantaged, we can find a form of reciprocity implicit even here, in particular, an expectation of reciprocal action and mutual aid were it needed. More direct reciprocity is evident in traditional labor union solidarity, as well as in some social movements, where the solidarity actions are among people perceived to be similarly situated. In these various cases of networking solidarity, I have argued that normatively solidarity requires deference to the needs and goals of others as they themselves understand them. And ideally, solidarity movements should embody democratic modes of decision making among the participants, given their equal status as members, and their shared commitment to the overarching goals of their movement. Although there are some fully shared goals that motivate these forms of networking solidarity, especially inasmuch as they often take a project-oriented form, different subgroups act to realize these goals in ways they themselves determine, and they liaise or link up with each other to decide how each group can best participate and contribute. As groups or associations of their own, they tend to have their own sets of goals and plans unrelated to these solidarity actions. But they take themselves to be part of the larger movement or set of associations, aimed at overcoming forms of domination or suffering. Moreover, they often make use of online forms of networking and social media to coordinate their efforts with each other, and they offer each other mutual support and encouragement. Although the groups or individuals linking up in these networks can in some sense be regarded as themselves constituting a superordinate group, and thus from an abstract perspective as not being essentially different from the first form of group solidarity, the latter is unitary and understood by the members as a single group, most often pre-existing, while the former involves loose relations among groups (or sometimes also individuals) undertaken for the purpose of a given project or aim. In practice, then, we can regard these two forms of solidarity as distinct, and see them as manifested in two different types of social phenomena. The 'we' in the case of networking solidarity is constructed serially and diversely by its member groups (or individuals), and is oriented to a particular cause. Nonetheless, insofar as they take overcoming domination, oppression, or exploitation as their aim, they are at least partly defined by an egalitarian commitment to justice, and the 'we' should remain open to others similarly committed. It must be granted that labor solidarity and most social movement solidarity have often involved shared interests and an antagonistic relation to others regarded as exploitative or authoritarian. Indeed, the first sense of solidarity, as group solidarity, admits of a similar antagonistic relation to outsiders, e.g., in the case of hostility toward other nation-states. Nonetheless, we can see how normatively each of these forms of solidarity has the potential to develop in ways that are more inclusive rather than exclusive. In the national case this is possible if borders are not understood to reflect unitary shared identities but come to be regarded as contingent and indeed as porous, or at least much more so than at present. Likewise, labor and social movement solidarity are in principle open to all those who wish to join in their efforts to work toward social (and indeed global) justice, even though it must be admitted that in practice those benefiting from exploitation are unlikely to join in. The connection of solidarity to social and global justice suggests the need to theorize more fully how structural or systemic forms of injustice set the frame and motivation for many solidarity movements and can serve to orient their practices. The notion of structural injustice is perhaps most relevant to networking solidarities, especially where they explicitly aim at establishing justice and therefore would have to address such institutional forms of injustice. But this notion can also apply to unitary solidarity groups, if they seek to adequately meet the basic needs and respect the human rights of their members, who are affected by these forms of injustice. That structures or systems may operate so as to consistently produce injustices has been a prime insight in Marxist theories, which highlight the way the capitalist economic system exploits workers, apart from the specific intentions of individuals, who often do not aim at such exploitation. While classical liberal theories tend to put great weight on individual action and intention, the Marxist emphasis on structure and on the functioning of the capitalist system focuses us on the underlying ways in which corporations operate in accordance with the requirement to increase profits by way of the exploitation of labor. Marxist theory also brings to the forefront the notion of objectification. This refers to the significance of the embodiment of intentions and plans in artifacts and on the need to be recognized by others if people are to understand themselves. That is, it introduces elements of externality required for self-transformation, whether individual or cultural. In such an approach, not only the social, but the material, environment for human action can in various ways reflect existing class and other salient group differences. This environment for action also generates steady expectations and encourages certain modes of comportment in people who tend to operate in accordance with prevailing social practices and rules. At the same time, people have the capacity to change these practices and rules over time, though often only through collective choices and action. (This point may not always be duly appreciated in theories of structural injustice themselves.) More contemporary analyses of the structural factors that contribute to injustice, as found for example in the work of Anthony Giddens and Iris Young, cast light on how individuals can reproduce problematic practices through their choices within these structural constraints. While Giddens focused on processes of what he called structuration, Young highlighted consumer choices and other social practices that serve to produce and reproduce injustices, in a certain sense unwittingly, for example, by impacting sweatshop workers at a distance or by limiting access to the existing housing stock. According to Young:Structural injustices are harms that come to people as a result of structural processes in which many people participate. These participants may well be aware that their actions contribute to the processes that produce the outcomes, but for many it is not possible to trace the specific causal relation between their particular actions and some particular part of the outcome. This emphasis on structure, Young argues, turns our attention to 'how the institutions of a society work together to produce outcomes that support or minimize the threat of domination,' where these outcomes largely depend on the social positioning that conditions people's diverse life prospects. In later work, Young's emphasis turns more to the ways that practices that connect people to each other implicate them in these processes of social and structural reproduction. On her view, the connections in which people stand give rise to what she calls a 'forward looking' sense of political responsibility, and evoke the need to stand in solidarity with others. Leaving aside the difficult issue of responsibility, we can observe that focusing primarily on the amorphous practices of social life can lead us away from understanding the workings of contemporary political economy and its detrimental effects on those who lack the power to take any part in determining its direction. I have also criticized a view that would simply characterize everyone-whether workers or top executives-as implicated in these processes and practices, seeing these groups as distinguished only by degree. Rather, some have substantial control over the processes to which others are subjected. But for the purpose of the analysis here, we can take structural or systemic injustice to refer both to the operation of the formal political-economic institutions of capitalism (along with racism and patriarchy), and to the more informal practices and rules of social life, which also contribute to the production and reproduction of inequalities. How, then, are these structures and the injustices they produce connected to solidarity, as analyzed here? Without attempting a thorough account, we can observe that capitalist economic institutions have in fact disrupted earlier forms of solidarity, such as those characteristic of pre-capitalist political economies, marked by what Durkheim called mechanical solidarity. At the same time, new forms of solidarity have been created, e.g., through the division of labor (as described in Durkheim's term organic solidarity). In political contexts as well, older solidarities within local communities have tended to give way to national, or even transnational, forms. Yet, of greater relevance for us here are the ways in which political economic institutions, with the inequalities and forms of domination and exploitation they may generate, frame and motivate new solidarity movements to address these injustices. Recognizing how institutions and practices function in ways that assign differential power to various groups in society is essential if justice is to be constructed through solidaristic action. Even where solidarity actions aim only at relieving suffering and do not directly attempt to eliminate oppression or explanation, some understanding of the social and institutional context of those to be aided is needed if the solidarity actions are to be effective. For example, efforts to address the aftermath of hurricanes and also to mitigate them going forward call for attention to the social conditions that lead impoverished or minority groups to be disproportionately affected by such natural events-by reason of where they live, or the ways they lack protection against excessive damage from these natural events. In such situations, empathy with the situation of others, and even specific action to assist them, however important they may be, are insufficient unless they are coupled with an understanding of the impacts of the structural features of political economy and the injustices to which the operations of these institutions give rise. This is even more evidently the case where solidarity movements aim directly at overcoming oppression and exploitation, e.g., ending sweatshop labor. In such cases, effective action must not only support workers individually or remedy their specific situation but requires a socially critical analysis of the prevailing context that gives rise to the exploitation in the first place, which may also provide indications of how to address it. We can grant that solidaristic practices, whether in healthcare or other contexts, may well have their own utility as an expression of our sociality and our enjoyment of acting in common, and in this sense solidarity can even be said to have some value apart from its functioning to help in constructing justice. But the argument here is that these practices can be truly effective in meeting their aims only if they go well beyond charity and also beyond practices that simply 'incur costs to assist others recognized as similar' (in the Prainsack/Buyx formulation). If they are to conduce toward justice, these solidarity practices and movements need to address the ways that social, economic, and political institutions systematically function to deny some groups of people the basic means of life, and give rise to pervasive inequalities in people's opportunities for self-development and for participating in processes of collective self-determination. This is the case most clearly for what I have called networking solidarities, but it can apply to solidarity within more unitary contexts like nation-states to the degree that the bonds involved (e.g., among citizens) are not merely pre-existing but affirmed and reinvented over time. Even more demandingly, at a normative level, we can say that solidaristic action needs to take seriously the requirement for deep social transformation in the direction of social, and indeed global, justice. In this way, as I have argued elsewhere, although solidarity remains particularistic in its orientation to specific problems and specific groups or individuals, it can keep in view the demands of universal human dignity. And solidarity movements can verify that their particular goals contribute (in however limited a way) to the broader goal of egalitarian social transformation. Thus, dispositions to empathy, deference, and mutual aid remain important components of solidaristic social action, but a critical analysis of the social context and concretely taking action oriented to alleviating structural injustices are needed as well. In addition, since the institutional context, with its given power relations, frames the various solidarity movements, sometimes the prevailing power formations are replicated within these movements themselves. I suggest that this calls for groups and agents to be self-reflective about these effects of the structural context in which they function, and to be on guard about the dangers of their own possible complicity in its replication and perpetuation. An important proviso should be mentioned before returning to the case of healthcare and considering the impact of the notions of solidarity analyzed here. That is, although solidarity has here been related to justice, with the concomitant need to analyze and address the structural injustices that frame solidarity action, there is no implication that solidarity movements or other solidarity activities are sufficient for achieving the institutional changes that justice requires. For that, democratic legislation and various political and economic transformations are also needed. But solidarity, whether binding the members of a nation-state, or interpreted in newer networking forms, are one important way of constructing the conditions for these transformations, or even, in some cases of prefiguring more just relations within the social relations of solidarity themselves. There is no question that the new focus on solidarity holds considerable import for healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx have effectively argued. But the issue for us is what further benefit would result from incorporating solidarity's connection to justice, holding in view the significance of countering structural or systemic injustices. Given the vast range and specifics of healthcare and the social and economic factors conducive to health, I will focus on only a few of the most obvious implications for the practice of healthcare and for the potentially solidaristic activities of practitioners. We can ask: what difference would it make if we take seriously the need to address the differential structural power of the individuals and groups involved in healthcare, whether as practitioners or those served by them? And what is the scope and nature of the solidarity thus required? I will suggest in this final section that understanding solidarity in relation to structural injustice can not only shed new light on the sorts of examples that Prainsack and Buyx consider, but also, more importantly perhaps, highlight an entirely different range of examples of healthcare solidarity from the ones those authors consider. It takes us beyond such cases as the readiness to assist others through participating in healthcare databases or biobanks to cases of active participation in social movements aimed at improving healthcare nationally or transnationally, or, more defensively, to protesting structural injustices that lead to the wrongful denial of healthcare or to deep inequalities in its allocation. An obvious case of structural injustice in healthcare is provided by the deficiencies evident in the U.S. health insurance system (or lack of a system). Europeans have long recognized the centrality of solidarity with fellow citizens needed to undergird a willingness to contribute through taxes to a universal healthcare system. The types of provision in fact vary considerably, from socialized medicine as in the UK to state-funded support for private insurance provision, as in the Netherlands, along with dual systems mixing public and private support. But the universality at which these systems aim reflects the recognition of people's shared vulnerabilities in matters of health, and even an understanding that healthcare is a human right required by justice. There is also the acknowledgement that systematic or structural provision (or at least a guarantee) of healthcare is required in order to realize the universality at stake here. It is perhaps worth mentioning that despite their achievements, structural injustices do nonetheless persist in many of the European systems themselves. This is particularly the case where there are two tiers of provision such that private insurance is needed in order to gain superior care that (ideally at least) should be available to all. (Granted that in some European countries the public providers may actually be superior to private ones in some respects.) The lack of universal healthcare in the United States is evidently primarily due to the existence of structural injustice, rather than simply reflecting an absence of solidarity among compatriots. To state the obvious: the U.S. private insurance industry-and especially its leading large for-profit companies-is immensely powerful and, currently at least, enormously profitable. As part of the dominion of capitalist economic forms, these private firms also have inordinate influence over politics, as do the large drug companies. The activities of these companies exemplify the role of the 'power of money' that is widely prevalent in U.S. politics and society, which in turn circumscribes the possibilities for public policy and law. Corporate lobbying and campaign contributions from corporations and the wealthy notably undercut political equality in the United States and can also prevent attention to the basic tasks involved in meeting human needs in equitable ways. Beyond this, it can be argued that the systematic differences between people's starting positions, depending on their class and race, in large measure fall out of existing economic functioning, particularly given the resistance of the powerful to the redistributions that would be needed for genuinely equal opportunities. Moreover, these differential and deleterious starting positions conduce to worse health outcomes for children affected by them, and for many adults over the course of their lives. In view of this systemic injustice, the sort of solidarity needed, then, is not only an empathic identification with other citizens (or better, with all members of the political community, including non-citizens). Rather, for meaningful change, attention also needs to be paid to the structural barriers to equal and universal healthcare. Although improvements and reforms can probably be made even without fundamental changes in these background structural economic and political conditions, realizing the goal of genuinely equal treatment would require transforming those basic economic structures themselves. And this in turn calls for social movements aimed at these transformations. In the case of the United States, some healthcare workers in fact have taken the lead in solidarity actions to preserve the existing limited forms of health insurance against efforts to strip vulnerable people of their coverage altogether. This represents an example of a type of solidarity action in the service of justice. Needless to say, much more needs to be done to develop a fully critical solidarity movement of the sort required. Indeed, some healthcare worker groups-notably National Nurses United and Physicians for Universal Healthcare-have taken the lead in spearheading the movement for Medicare for All, going considerably beyond the efforts to prevent repeal of the Affordable Care Act. They originally argued for a public option when that healthcare law was under development, and have gone on to organize healthcare consumers in various locales across the United States, including rural areas and those with large industries, to press for systemic changes in health insurance and in healthcare delivery, such as through establishing non-profit community health centers. In both domestic contexts and more global ones, connecting solidarity to structural injustice has been important for understanding and addressing the social and economic factors that greatly magnify the health impacts of natural disasters, e.g., of hurricanes or tsunamis or volcanic eruptions. Whereas solidarity with affected people has most often been episodic and motivated by empathy with them, attention to the structural factors that exacerbate the impact of these disasters on vulnerable populations expands the scope of what needs to be done in a forward-looking justice-oriented perspective. As suggested earlier, structural injustices that lead impoverished people to live in weak dwellings or in insecure geographical areas also expose them differentially to the health and other effects of weather or environmental catastrophes. Beyond the specific catastrophes, we can see that climate change itself has greater impacts on those groups as well, effects that will only increase over time. Cases that illustrate the ways that structural injustices intensify natural disasters (if not also contributing to causing them) are manifold, and the solidarity movements that have responded to these disasters are instructive for our purposes. A well known case is Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, where African Americans made up 80% of the people in flooded low-lying communities, sometimes residing in inadequate housing like trailers, and without the means to escape the rising waters (especially due to low rates of car ownership). Not only did these minority communities bear the large part of the deaths and injuries from the hurricane, but also they experienced abiding health problems, e.g., those due to mold. Yet, despite the grossly inadequate federal response to this disaster, residents offered each other mutual assistance and were also aided by solidarity groups like Common Ground, which helped with community rebuilding, including founding a free health clinic, and aiding with wetlands restoration. A related example is the response to Hurricane Sandy in the New York/New Jersey area, where healthcare workers set up free clinics in trucks, and helped to raise money for much needed medical supplies for the various communities that lacked adequate resources of their own to deal with the storm aftermath. Internationally, structural injustices significantly contributed to the grave impact of the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, in which over 200,000 people were killed and over 300,000 injured, with more than 1.5 million rendered homeless. Before the quake, many Haitians were impoverished and lived in slum conditions, leaving them highly vulnerable to floods and other natural disasters. The International Monetary Fund had implemented austerity programs in the preceding decades, which contributed to an evisceration of the public health systems and in turn to the health crisis following the earthquake, where there were radically insufficient medical supplies available. In the period that preceded the quake, an estimated 75% of Haiti's healthcare services had been provided by multinational and faith-based non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and its entire health supply system was externally run. The aid following the quake likewise involved a massive influx of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), but Haitian NGOs were marginalized, as were the Haitian authorities, and over 90% of the aid money went to international actors, including the UN and INGOs, and to the private sector. This aid, too, was unequally distributed between the capital and rural areas, and between well-off and less well-off areas of Port-au-Prince itself. In contrast, more adequately addressing the medical needs arising from the quake, some international healthcare NGOs succeeded in working in solidarity with local Haitians, in particular, the INGO Partners in Health, which explicitly incorporated a focus on the impacts of structural factors in their efforts. A more recent case is provided by Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in the summer of 2017. This natural disaster likewise calls attention to political economic and social structural factors that greatly aggravated the situation. Years of austerity, this time managed by the U.S. government and banks, along with massive debt, left hospitals without many doctors and with inadequate medical supplies needed to deal with injuries following the storm. Puerto Rico's defective electrical grid also hampered the recovery from the hurricane. The inadequacies of this grid were exacerbated by the freeze imposed on a public infrastructure fund, which was instead used to funnel support to public-private partnerships under the same restructuring program. Moreover, in Puerto Rico, as in Haiti, we observe inequalities in the response to affected communities in the capital vs. in poorer rural areas. Solidarity work by healthcare workers, including doctors from Cuba, along with aid from the Puerto Rican diaspora, has been important in recovery and rebuilding efforts, but has not been able to make up for the lack of support from the U.S. government. It is evident, then, that effective action requires understanding the economic and social factors that condition people's life chances and their health, including the limitations imposed by their places of residence. Indeed, the economic functioning of capitalism seems to be a major causal factor not only in these discrete natural events but also in climate change itself. While no single solidarity movement can counter these structural or systemic effects, establishing a linkage between a particular event and the deeper structural conditions for its differential impact on impoverished or vulnerable populations is important for adequate public policy going forward, and for the provision of the right forms of assistance in the present. It suggests the need for aid that not only restores the situation to the one that preceded the environmental event in question but that establishes a better, and more resilient, situation going forward. Clearly, an interlinking and networking of solidarity movements and of civil society organizations, as well as of public policy, would be necessary for the social transformative changes required. Similar arguments concerning the need for solidarity activity to remedy structural injustices can be advanced in regard to other central national or global health problems: for example, the provision of clean water, as in the case of Flint, Michigan, or the protection of the water supplies from fracking, or from underwater pipelines as in the case of Standing Rock, where there was a substantial solidarity struggle in support of the affected Sioux indigenous people in 2016-2017. Internationally, the health challenges include the need for wider and cheaper provision of drugs to counter HIV-AIDS along with a host of other illnesses; ways of dealing with malaria and with preventable epidemics; providing clean water worldwide; and addressing the range of health issues that result from trafficking, child labor, and slave labor. In all these cases, solidarity movements would need to join up with others working to counter exploitation and the dominion of the profit motive, or struggling to rectify the deep inequalities in social and economic conditions, along with the effects of absolute poverty. Likewise, in regard to the overarching problem of climate change itself, we have already seen the emergence of major transnational solidarity movements, often taking the form of networks of local groups, and including the participation of numerous healthcare workers. Examples are the older Via Campesina, the People's Climate Movement, and 350.org, among many others. In the international context, mention should also be made of the way structural injustice frames medical problems arising from illness and other natural causes, but also those arising from war and other forms of violence. Some solidarity movements in those contexts have focused on offering aid to the injured, as with the 'White Helmets' operating in rebel-held areas of Syria, extracting the living from the rubble following Syrian government bombings. While this group is composed mainly of volunteers and is anti-authoritarian, it otherwise eschews any specific political affiliation. The Kurdish YPG (People's Defense Units) in northern Syria, which also has healthcare units operating in areas under attack, presents a somewhat different case, since it is explicitly anti-capitalist in orientation. However, a full discussion of these complex cases would take us beyond the scope of the present discussion. We can, in conclusion, return to two of the cases analyzed by Prainsack and Buyx and attempt to view them through the lens of structural injustice, with the resulting transformed interpretation of the solidaristic action required in those bioethical contexts. While less dramatic than the leading examples analyzed above, where solidarity needs to be directed explicitly towards countering structural injustices, the Prainsack and Buyx cases pose some interesting issues for consideration. The two applications of solidarity are those of governing health databases (as they put it), and personalized medicine and healthcare. As we have noted, in the course of their acute analysis, Prainsack and Buyx occasionally point to the dangers of the commercial uses of medical databases. But we can ask whether their recognition of these dangers fully informs their own account. Perhaps because they wish to make proposals that can be adopted immediately, the authors employ the notion of solidarity to recommend only modest restrictions on the use of these databases. For example, they urge that their use contribute to some public good at the same time as they retain their commercial or profit-oriented purposes, where these latter can even remain primary. The authors also tend to accept the existing limits on public funding for research as a given, rather than strongly arguing for its expansion by way of solidarity actions, however difficult accomplishing this might be in the present. In fact, the use of health databases for the purpose of private profit is a social choice that a society need not endorse. Likewise, the scope and extent of public funding is also a matter of policy and legislation, even if alternative directions would be difficult to implement in the context of a capitalist political economy. It is constraints posed by the latter that I would highlight in an alternative structural perspective on solidarity, taking us beyond the commitment to assist others that these authors foreground in their analysis. Indeed, one can further argue that the solidarity that Prainsack and Buyx seek, as a willingness to share one's own data in large databases, can actually be undercut by structural injustices. This is evident especially in regard to the potential commercial use of the data. Informed people, aware of the dangers that this background structural feature poses, may well be resistant to taking a chance on acting in the solidaristic ways that these authors recommend. People may be wary of these commercial uses and indeed, may even come to expect them, so they would decide against contributing their own information, despite assurances of confidentiality. In this way, the existing tendency toward an overriding concern with private self-interest is reinforced by the very existence and continuation of these structural background conditions. In this context, efforts to eliminate structural injustice, if effective, could be expected to assist in promoting the sorts of solidarities that Prainsack and Buyx seek. Another specific difference I have with these authors' otherwise excellent account of databases and their governance has to do with their rather puzzling remarks about dealing with the risks that must be accepted by those who contribute their health data to the database. For Prainsack and Buyx, solidarity is supposed to motivate people to provide their own health data to these databases and they argue that only 'broad consent' is needed for the use of this data by researchers rather than more traditional forms of informed consent, which they regard as excessively demanding and costly in this context. The authors propose that less attention should be given to preventing the risks of re-identification (with the potential discrimination that might follow) and more attention given to mitigating or compensating for harms that may accrue to individuals from misuse of their data in the future. This includes, they suggest, making fewer efforts to assure individual consent in a strong sense, and instead placing more emphasis on putting funds aside to remedy harms or injuries arising from misidentification or, more generally, from the misuse of information. I believe that encouraging solidaristic actions and practices of the sort these authors seek to engender would instead be aided by focusing even more than is presently done on preventing and limiting the risks that inevitably attend contributing one's personal health data for use in medical databases. This is so not only for instrumental reasons, namely, because otherwise people will not participate out of (largely rational) fear of these untoward consequences. A greater emphasis on limiting risk is also essential in recognition of the real structural problems that frame these databases, namely, the great commercial potential they hold and their openness to corporate use of the included health information in the interests of profits, along with the deep challenges involved in safeguarding privacy online. These structural features would not be meliorated by the authors' otherwise fine proposals to allow contributors to access their own raw data, and to be informed of possible health impacts on them personally that emerge from the research the databases facilitate. To adequately deal with the various social, technological, and medical challenges posed by these large databanks requires solidarity action in the interest of structural change besides the reforms the authors have sketched. Further, although Prainsack and Buyx helpfully suggest in passing that a few patients should be included among those who serve on the proposed governance boards for large databanks, it seems that the majority on these boards would be made up of standing groups of people whose only requirement is not to have conflicts of interest in regard to the potential uses of the databanks. This delimitation seems insufficient to assure the responsibility owed to the contributors of data, particularly in view of the background functioning of social and economic institutions that give managers and other elites the preponderance of power. Inasmuch as ethics boards are also ruled out by the authors as trustees (because they are overburdened, in their view, or may not be knowledgeable about the specific research in question), it is unclear how these governance boards would best be constituted on their approach. A strongly solidaristic view would require that a substantial number should be drawn from patients or their representatives, though it would clearly also be important to include a sizable number of scientists and other experts. We can see then that quasi-democratic requirements emerge for the governance of these databanks, such that those affected by them would have some say in overseeing them. This follows as well from the feature of deference, which I suggested is an important aspect of an adequate conception of solidarity. Deference is required toward those one is assisting, who should have a major role in specifying their needs and how they want to be assisted. Efforts must thus be made to hear from them systematically. This involves new forms of democratic, or perhaps quasi-democratic, input into the policies or actions in question. I use the qualification 'quasi' here to indicate that the input in question may not always have to be formal, though there is certainly a place for formal rights of participation on governance boards by some representatives of patients or even the public at large. This sort of deference to patients and democratic input by them also casts light on the final example of solidarity in action, drawing again from the Prainsack and Buyx account. They analyze the case of 'personalized medicine' or 'precision medicine,' which most often refers to the use of analytical software and databases to target medicine and healthcare to individuals in ways that are unique to them, e.g., by the use of genomics and through such software systems as IBM's Watson. The authors rightly point out that group characteristics continue to be important to these analyses, since data about groups provide the parameters for evaluating the medical status of individuals. But in personalized or precision medicine, the focus comes to be on the intersection of these group findings within particular differentiated individuals. Moreover, the authors usefully propose to extend the characteristics that are taken into account in personalized practices to include also social ones, as well as individuals' cultural and personal preferences. In regard to the identification of group characteristics and their embodiment in unique ways in individuals, it is clearly important to adopt a socially critical perspective as to what constitutes a relevant group. That is, taking structure into account suggests the importance of becoming aware of social preconceptions and potential bias in the identification of a group. This holds not only for standard ascriptive group identifications along the lines of gender, race, etc., but also of newer sets of subgroups or emerging crosscutting groups. It would also affect the ways both researchers and clinicians identify the social background conditions and the social and cultural preferences of the individuals, if these are to be taken into account and added to personalized medicine and healthcare, as Prainsack and Buyx propose. We can delineate one final implication of the importance of participation in healthcare by those affected, which I have suggested follows from a conception of solidarity that includes deference and hearing from others as to how they want to be aided or assisted. Clearly, a fuller view of personalized medicine would not only look at evidence-based therapies targeted at individuals drawing from large databases of relevant research, but should be open to input from patients themselves about the aims and methods of therapy. Even the basic interpretation of health and wellness, both of which are clearly shared goals of patients and clinicians, can be open to patients' input. This sort of participation by those affected by the practice of medicine and healthcare need not be understood in a way that diminishes the role of science or expertise. Rather, it reflects the recognition that solidarity with patients requires openness to their own perspectives and goals, and ideally involves their participation in co-determining their own care. Given the range of research knowledge and existing therapies, a truly personalized medicine would not only home in on targeted precise therapies, but would involve an interactive and cooperative process of health building and health sustenance. As argued here, it would also require practices of attunement to, and solidarity with, a patient's social context, needs, and aspirations. Further, understanding that social context, in turn, requires a focus on the differential power and inequalities that result from prevailing political and economic institutions, that is, an attention to structural injustice.

INTRODUCTION CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF SOLIDARITY IN HEALTHCARE TWO SENSES OF SOLIDARITY AND THEIR RELATION TO JUSTICE STRUCTURAL INJUSTICE AND SOLIDARITY SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes The concept of solidarity has recently come to prominence in the healthcare literature, addressing the motivation for taking seriously the shared vulnerabilities and medical needs of compatriots and for acting to help them meet these needs. In a recent book, Prainsack and Buyx take solidarity as a commitment to bear costs to assist others regarded as similar, with implications for governing health databases, personalized medicine, and organ donation. More broadly, solidarity has been understood normatively to call for 'standing with' or assisting fellow community members and possibly also distant others in regard to their needs, whether for its own sake or in order to realize the demands of justice. I argue here that the understanding of solidarity in the existing bioethics literature is unduly restricted by not sufficiently theorizing the notion of structural (or systemic) injustice and its import for understanding solidarity. Extending traditional conceptions of labor and social movement solidarity, I contrast unitary solidarity within a given group with 'networking solidarities' across groups. I analyze the meaning of structural injustice and its significance for solidarity, including countering institutionally entrenched inequalities and economic exploitation. I then apply this broadened conception to healthcare, discussing structural problems with the U.S. insurance system and the solidarity movements addressing its deficiencies. I analyze some natural disasters and global health challenges that were aggravated by structural injustices, along with the solidarity movements they engendered. Finally, I revisit the questions of governing health databases and of personalized medicine with the enlarged conception of solidarity in view. healthcare; justice; solidarity;JUSTICE","Evaluation of ecological instream flow considering hydrological alterations in the Yellow River basin, China The Yellow River is the second largest river in China and is the important source for water supply in the northwestern and northern China. It is often regarded as the mother river of China. Owing to climatic change and intensifying human activities, such as increasing withdrawal of water for meeting growing agricultural irrigation needs since 1986, the flow of Yellow River has decreased, with serious impacts on the ecological environment. Using multiple hydrological indicators and Flow Duration Curve (DFC)-based ecodeficit and ecosurplus, this study investigates the impact of hydrological alterations, such as the impact of water reservoirs or dams, on downstream ecological instream flow. Results indicate that: (1) due to the impoundment and hydrological regulations of water reservoirs, occurrence rates and magnitudes of high flow regimes have decreased and the decrease is also found in the magnitudes of low flow events. These changes tend to be more evident from the upper to the lower Yellow River basin; (2) human activities tend to enhance the instream flow variability, particularly after the 1980s;(3) the ecological environment in different parts of the Yellow River basin is under different degrees of ecological risk. In general, lower to higher ecological risk can be detected due to hydrological alterations from the upper to the lower Yellow River basin. This shows that conservation of ecological environment and river health is facing a serious challenge in the lower Yellow River basin; (4) ecological in stream flow indices, such as ecodeficit and ecosurplus, and IHA32 hydrological indicators are in strong relationships, suggesting that ecodeficit and ecosurplus can be regarded as appropriate ecological indicators for developing measures for mitigating the adverse impact of human activities on the conservation of ecological environment in the Yellow River basin.

Although the non-linear nature of ecological dynamics is widely recognised, the concept of threshold responses has only recently received the warranted attention in conservation and management. In this short review we synthesise current knowledge on ecological thresholds and alternative stable states and review examples of threshold responses in riparian wetlands. The review shows that changes in the hydrologic regime often represent the trigger that causes abrupt shifts in riparian species composition. Also, inputs of nutrients over critical loads can cause drastic changes in wetland biogeochemical functions. We then discuss the implications of threshold relationships for the management of riparian wetlands. Critical steps needed to embody threshold models in adaptive management include the assessment of wetlands' predisposition to threshold responses and the adaptation of monitoring schemes to facilitate the statistical identification of nonlinear relationships. Future research should also aim at assessing how climate change may influence the likelihood of ecological thresholds. Also, as the dynamics of degraded ecosystems often differ substantially from those of pristine systems, a better understanding of human modified systems is necessary for the development of a predictive framework.

Merr.] and explore the impact of climate change on soybean in the frigid region in China by using daily climatic variables from 144 meteorological stations for the period 1971-2019. The gradually descending model is used to estimate photosynthesis, light-temperature, and climatic potential productivity of soybean. The results show that climate potential productivity of soybean in the frigid region ranges from large to small: Liaoning > Jilin > Heilongjiang > East Four Leagues (four cities in eastern Inner Mongolia), with Heilongjiang and East Four Leagues showing a significant upward trend. Spatially, the climate potential productivity is larger on plains than that on mountains. The Northeast Plain and Sanjiang Plain are areas with high climate potential productivity. Changes in climatic factors have different impacts on the climate potential productivity of soybean. The influence of temperature changes on the climate potential productivity shows a positive effect, and climate warming compensates for the lack of heat in the frigid region. Furthermore, radiation and precipitation are the main climatic factors leading to spatial differences in the climate potential productivity of soybean in the frigid region. Radiation changes have a positive effect on soybean climate potential productivity in plain areas and a negative effect on the mountains. However, precipitation reduction negatively affects most of the frigid region, while it has a positive effect on the two plains of Heilongjiang. Precipitation responses the needs of soybean growth. Our findings recommend that a transition of soybean planting from the mountainous region to plain, that is, from low potential productivity areas to high potential productivity areas, could be an effective strategy for regional optimization for planting structure and rational utilization of irrigation technology.

While technology currently provides the means to predict large-scale bleaching, predicting reef-scale and within-reef patterns in real-time for all reef users is limited. In 2020, heat stress across the Great Barrier Reef underpinned the region's third bleaching event in 5 years. Here we review the heterogeneous emergence of bleaching across Heron Island reef habitats and discuss the oceanographic drivers that underpinned variable bleaching emergence. We do so as a case study to highlight how reef end-user groups who engage with coral reefs in different ways require targeted guidance for how, and when, to alter their use of coral reefs in response to bleaching events. Our case study of coral bleaching emergence demonstrates how within-reef scale nowcasting of coral bleaching could aid the development of accessible and equitable bleaching response strategies on coral reefs. bleaching alerts; climate adaptation; coral bleaching; coral reef;CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL-STRESS; IMPACTS; FUTURE; ECOSYSTEMS; PROTECTION; RESISTANCE; PATTERNS; DAMAGE","Climate Change and Reversed Intergenerational Equity: the Problem of Costs Now, for Benefits Later Climate change is often seen as an issue of intergenerational equity-consumption now creates costs for future generations. However, radical mitigation now would reverse the problem, creating immediate costs for current generations, while the benefits would be primarily for future ones. This is a policy problem, as persuading those living now to bear the cost of changes whose benefits will mostly accrue after their deaths is politically difficult. The policy challenge is then how to temporally match costs to benefits, either by deferring mitigation costs, or by speeding up climatic benefits. Geoengineering may provide some help here, as it might enable climate change to be slowed more immediately, at a lower upfront cost, and allow a greater share of the mitigation and adaptation burden to be passed on to those in the future who will benefit most. intergenerational equity; intergenerational justice; mitigation costs; cost-benefit analysis; geoengineering; negative-emission technologies (NETs); solar radiation management (SRM);JUSTICE","Climate Change Projections for Tanzania Based on High-Resolution Regional Climate Models From the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Africa The impacts of climate change are predicted to compromise social-economic developments in developing countries. Adaptation is the only option to reduce the impacts. However, before starting determining adaptation strategies, it is important to conduct scientific research to understand possible pathways of future climate change under different emission scenarios. This is essential for having scientific facts that would guide the formulation of effective adaptation strategies. In this study, climate change projections for Tanzania is carried out using outputs of high resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment program (CORDEX). Future (2011-2100) projections of daily rainfall, minimum and maximum temperatures under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 are compared with baseline (1971-2000) simulations. The comparison is based on determining the departure of future climate during present (2011-2040), mid (2041-2070) and end (2071-2100) centuries from baseline (1971-2000) climate condition. Results reveal that there are likely to be an obvious increased minimum and maximum temperature trend over the entire country in three future periods (2011-2040), (2041-2070), and (2071-2100) under both emission scenarios RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5. This is especially true for the western parts of the country, southwestern highlands and the eastern parts of Lake Nyasa where maximum temperatures are projected to be greater than 3.5 degrees C and in the range of 2 to 2.4 degrees C under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. The western sides of the Lake Victoria basin and parts of Northeastern highlands are likely to feature increased minimum temperatures in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 degrees C under RCP 8.5 emission scenario. The cold season: June-July-August-September (JJAS) is likely to become warmer than the warm season that starts from October and continue to April or May. During JJAS season, the country is likely to experience increased maximum temperature in the range of 1.7 to 2.4 degrees C and 2 to 4 degrees C in mid (2041-2070) and end (2070-2100) centuries respectively. Rainfall over parts of northeastern highlands and Coastal regions is projected to increase in the range of 0.5 to 1 mm/day and 0.25 to 0.5 mm/day under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios respectively. However, the western regions, southwestern highlands and eastern side of Lake Nyasa are likely to experience decreased amount of rainfall in the range of 0.5 to 1mm/day under both RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 emission scenarios. climate change; temperature; rainfall; CORDEX; regional climate models;AFRICA; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; IMPACTS; ABILITY; CORDEX; RAINS","Northern Research Policy Contributions to Canadian Arctic Sustainability Academic research plays a key role in developing understanding of sustainability issues in the Canadian Arctic, yet northern organizations and governments struggle to find research that is relevant, respectful of local interests, and that builds local capacity. Northern science and research policies communicate expectations for how research should be prioritized, planned, conducted, and disseminated. They discuss northern leadership of research and outline the diverse roles that northerners and northern organizations could fill in research programs and projects. Many of these documents are founded on the need for research to improve environmental, economic, and social sustainability in the Canadian North and provide insight into how academia can support a northern-led Arctic sustainability research agenda. The goal of this study is to examine northern research-policy documents to identify commonalities amongst the goals and priorities of northern organizations and their shared expectations for research in northern Canada. The objectives are to understand how organizations expect researchers to engage in and conduct research, how research programs can align with northern science policy objectives, and how academic research can support policy and decision-making related to sustainability. Through a quantitative content analysis combined with a qualitative thematic analysis, this comprehensive review examines research policy, strategy, guidance, and program documents produced by northern and northern-focused governments and Indigenous organizations. Relationships, partnership, and communication are the foundations of relevant and applicable research, requiring both resources and time for local and partner participation. Our analysis shows that researchers should consider potential policy applications for sustainability research early on in the development of research projects, ensuring that relevant local and policy partners are involved in designing the project and communicating results. northern research policy; research governance; research priorities; Arctic; sustainability; Yukon; Northwest Territories; Nunavut; Nunavik; Nunatsiavut;PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; INUIT; PARTNERSHIPS; COMMUNITIES; SCIENTISTS; CHALLENGES; KNOWLEDGE; FRAMEWORK; PROGRESS","Transcriptome and Degradome Profiling Reveals a Role of miR530 in the Circadian Regulation of Gene Expression in Kalanchoe marnieriana Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is an important photosynthetic pathway for plant adaptation to dry environments. CAM plants feature a coordinated interaction between mesophyll and epidermis functions that involves refined regulations of gene expression. Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucial post-transcription regulators of gene expression, however, their roles underlying the CAM pathway remain poorly investigated. Here, we present a study characterizing the expression of miRNAs in an obligate CAM species Kalanchoe marnieriana. Through sequencing of transcriptome and degradome in mesophyll and epidermal tissues under the drought treatments, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs that were potentially involved in the regulation of CAM. In total, we obtained 84 miRNA genes, and eight of them were determined to be Kalanchoe-specific miRNAs. It is widely accepted that CAM pathway is regulated by circadian clock. We showed that miR530 was substantially downregulated in epidermal peels under drought conditions; miR530 targeted two tandem zinc knuckle/PLU3 domain encoding genes (TZPs) that were potentially involved in light signaling and circadian clock pathways. Our work suggests that the miR530-TZPs module might play a role of regulating CAM-related gene expression in Kalanchoe. crassulacean acid metabolism; microRNA; photosynthesis; drought; circadian clock; Kalanchoe;CRASSULACEAN ACID METABOLISM; ARABIDOPSIS MICRORNAS; CAM PHOTOSYNTHESIS; C-3 PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CLOCK OPERATION; PLANT; CONSERVATION; INTEGRATION; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES","Portrayal of sustainability principles in the mission statements and on home pages of the world's largest organizations Conservation can be achieved only if sustainability is embraced as core to organizational cultures. To test the extent to which the related concepts of sustainability, conservation, response to climate change, poverty alleviation, and gender equity have been incorporated into organizational culture, we compared mission statements published from 1990 to 2000 with those published in 2014 for 150 organzations, including conservation nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), aid NGOs, government development agencies, resource extraction companies, and retailers (30 in each category). We also analyzed the 2014 home web pages of each organization. Relative to the earlier period, the frequency with which mission statements mentioned poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and a range of sustainable practices increased only slightly by 2014, particularly among resource extractors and retail companies. Few organizations in any sector had embedded either climate change or gender equity into their mission statements. In addition, the proportional intensity with which any of the aspirations were expressed did not change between periods. For current home pages, conservation NGOs, resource extractors, and government agencies were significantly more likely to acknowledge the importance of matters that were not part of their core business, but few aid agencies or retail companies promoted goals beyond alleviation of crises and profit maximization, respectively. Overall, there has been some progress in recognizing poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable practices, but gender equity and a determination to reduce impacts on climate change are still rarely promoted as central institutional concerns. Sustainability in general, and biodiversity conservation in particular, will not be achieved unless their importance is more widely apparent in core communication products of organizations.

Para evaluar la extension a la que los conceptos relacionados de sustentabilidad, conservacion, respuesta al cambio climatico, reduccion de la pobreza y equidad de genero han sido incorporados a la cultura organizativa, comparamos los pronunciamientos de mision de 150 organizaciones publicados desde 1990 a 2000 con aquellos publicados en 2014, incluidas organizaciones no gubernamentales (ONGs) de conservacion, ONGs de ayuda, agencias gubernamentales de desarrollo, companias de extraccion de recursos y minoristas (30 en cada categoria). Tambien analizamos las paginas de inicio de cada organizacion en 2014. En relacion al primer periodo, la frecuencia con la que los pronunciamientos de mision mencionaron la reduccion de la pobreza, la conservacion de la biodiversidad y una gama de practicas sustentables apenas incremento para el 2014, particularmente entre los extractores de recursos y las companias minoristas. Pocas organizaciones de cualquier sector incluyeron al cambio climatico o a la equidad de genero en sus pronunciamientos de mision. Algo mas que no cambio entre periodos fue la intensidad con la que cualquiera de las aspiraciones fue expresada. En las paginas de inicio actuales, las ONGs de conservacion, los extractores de recursos y las agencias gubernamentales tuvieron una mayor probabilidad significativa de reconocer la importancia de asuntos que no son parte de su incumbencia principal, pero pocas agencias de ayuda o companias minoristas promovieron objetivos mas alla de la reduccion de crisis y maximizacion del beneficio, respectivamente. En general, ha habido cierto progreso en el reconocimiento de la reduccion de la pobreza, la conservacion de la biodiversidad y las practicas sustentables, pero la equidad de genero y una determinacion para reducir los impactos sobre el cambio climatico todavia no son promovidos como preocupaciones centrales de las instituciones. La sustentabilidad en general y la conservacion de la biodiversidad en particular, no se lograran a menos que su importancia sea mucho mas aparente en los productos nucleares de comunicacion de las organizaciones.

The average annual precipitation in this subcatchment is relatively higher and groundwater recharge is relatively faster than in the rest of the river basin. Yet, seasonal water shortages occur due to the rapid increase of water abstractions in the summer months, mainly for crop irrigation. Up until 2030 the gap between water supply and demand is expected to deteriorate, considering the impacts of climate and socio-economic change. The adoption of environmental restrictions on water abstraction, which is a measure foreseen in the local river basin management plan, could decrease water stress substantially from 19.2% to 13.9%. However, this would require enormous (- 26%) cuts in the current water abstractions during June-September, lowering water demand coverage from 86% to 68%. Optimal combinations of measures, from an economic and environmental perspective, will need to be designed to bridge the gap between water supply and demand and restore water demand coverage to satisfactory levels. Hydrologic and water resources management modelling has been implemented using the Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP), which is a conceptual model based on water balances. nan;Naturalised flow; Water abstraction; Water demand; Water stress; Water supply; WEAP; Abstracting; Bridges; Catchments; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Groundwater; Rivers; Runoff; Water management; Water supply; Watersheds; Naturalised flow; Water abstraction; Water demand; Water stress; WEAP; Water resources; basin management; catchment; demand analysis; future prospect; groundwater abstraction; optimization; precipitation (climatology); recharge; river basin; socioeconomic conditions; water demand; water storage; water stress; water supply; Greece; Pinios Basin; Thessaly","Leaf morpho-anatomical traits in Vigna radiata L. affect plant photosynthetic acclimation to changing vapor pressure deficit Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) influences plant photosynthesis and the hydraulic behaviour associated with stomata regulation. However, it is not clear whether and how changes in leaf morpho-anatomical traits drive photosynthetic acclimation to VPD. Here, we examined the role of leaf anatomy in the eco-physiological responses of Vigna radiata L. to VPD changes in controlled environment. Plants were grown under two VPD levels (high-VPD, HV; low-VPD, LV) and then transferred to the opposite conditions (high-to-low, HLV; low-to-high, LHV). We hypothesised that growth under different VPDs may determine anatomical changes that could affect plant physiological plasticity to VPD variations. HV plant growth (height, leaf area, number of leaves) and gasexchange (net-photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency) were reduced in a range of 16?47 % compared to LV. This was mostly attributed to reduction in stomatal and vein density and lower stomatal conductance. After transferring these plants to a more favourable environment (HLV), they showed unchanged photosynthesis and conductance while LHV plants reduced their gas-exchange rates to control water loss under high evaporative demand. Morpho-anatomical traits (high density and smaller stomata, higher vein density) in LHV plants showed higher physiological plasticity. Therefore, physiological plasticity induced by anatomical traits should be considered when evaluating how plants would cope with environmental changes in a climate change scenario.

This study is an attempt to assess livelihood strategies pursued by rural households, investigate the most remunerative strategy, and identify the factors that influence a household's choice of better strategies in rural Nepal. Primary data collected in 453 households from three villages of central Nepal are analyzed quantitatively within a sustainable livelihood framework. This study categorized households into five main livelihood strategy groups. The results showed that the majority (61%) of the households diversified their income to non-farm sources. Livelihood diversification to business/enterprise strategies adopted by 16% of the households is the most remunerative strategy followed by commercial farming that includes 13% of the sample and are more relevant to poverty reduction. Land holding, education, agriculture and skill training, access to credit, and proximity to the road and market center are the major influencing factors on the adoption of higher returning livelihood strategies. Stimulating poor households to follow market-oriented farm and non-farm activities by improving access to education, vocational training, rural credit, and rural infrastructures is momentous for reducing poverty in the rural areas of central Nepal. livelihood strategy; poverty; cluster analysis; multivariate analysis; elevation; central Nepal;INCOME DIVERSIFICATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DETERMINANTS; AGRICULTURE; SETTLEMENTS; DEPENDENCE; HIGHLANDS; LABOR; LAND","Municipal climate change adaptation and mitigation: from planning to action in Nova Scotia Jurisdictions around the globe are working to address climate change and many municipalities are seeking to protect their communities from its impacts. Although nearly half the world's population resides in rural areas, most municipal climate change planning literature focuses on urban municipalities. To that end, this paper analyzes the public policy process of Nova Scotia, Canada's rural Municipal Climate Change Action Planning mandate.

The Paris Agreement is a treaty within the definition of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, but not every provision of the agreement creates a legal obligation. It contains a mix of mandatory and non-mandatory provisions relating to parties' mitigation contributions, as well as to the other elements of the Durban Platform, including adaptation and finance. One cannot definitively say how much the legally binding character of the Paris Agreement matters. Making the agreement legally binding may provide a greater signal of commitment and greater assurance of compliance. But transparency, accountability and precision can also make a significant difference, and legal bindingness can be a double-edged sword if it leads States not to participate or to make less ambitious commitments. Thus, the issue of legal character, though important, is only one factor in assessing the significance of the Paris outcome. nan;nan","Standardized precipitation index (SPI) for meteorological drought characterization in the Dagua river basin-Colombia The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) characterizes meteorological droughts of a place, by quantifying the deficit of rainfall in different time periods. Negative SPI values represents drought, while positive values indicate wet periods. The results suggest that negative SPI periods coincide with El Nino years: 82-83, 91-92 and 97-98. The 91-92 event had the largest impact on the region. These results indicate that the most severe droughts in the basin of Dagua, were presented at the quarters of Dec-Jan-Feb, Jan-Feb-Mar, Jun-Jul-Aug and Jul-Aug-Sep. The results have been obtained with geostatistical techniques, and are a basic input to formulate adaptation strategies and ensure food sovereignty of small farmers against drought. nan;Climate variability; Drought; El Niño; Standardized precipitation index; climate variation; drought; El Nino; meteorology; precipitation assessment; rainfall; Colombia","The Human Dimensions of Coastal Adaptation Strategies Not only are humans responsible for the anthropogenic causes of currently observed climate change, but we are also responsible for our responses to climate change. How we choose to respond provides important insights into our ability to collectively act in the face of threats with the unique characteristics of climate change. This communication attempts to provide an overview of some of the difficulties in forging new policy directions along our coastlines in an era of climate change. It is meant as a referential framing for the research presented in this Special Issue. As this communication is being written, the world is gripped by a global pandemic caused by a variant of the coronavirus. There are important corollaries between the underlying characteristics of the coronavirus and the causes and effects of climate change. Seeing how the global citizenry is responding to the current epidemic provides some insight into the difficulties in fostering collective action towards climate change. As with the pandemic, the issue is not really one of understanding the problem, but rather the varying human responses to the problem. We can expect the same difficulties as we continue to confront the ever-growing problem of climate change. climate change; coastal adaptation; collective action;nan","Random Forest Model Has the Potential for Runoff Simulation and Attribution Quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff changes is beneficial for developing sustainable water-management strategies within the local ecosystem. Machine-learning models were widely used in scientific research; yet, whether it is applicable for quantifying the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff changes is not well understood. To provide a new pathway, we quantified the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff changes using a machine-learning method (random forest model) in two semi-humid basins in this study. Results show that the random forest model provides good performances for runoff simulation; the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff changes from 1982 to 2014 were found between 6-9% and 91-94% in the Zijinguan basin, and 31-44% and 56-69% in the Daomaguan basin, respectively. Furthermore, the model performances were also compared with those of well-known elasticity-based and double-mass curve methods, and the results of these models are approximate in the investigated basins, which implies that the random forest model has the potential for runoff simulation and for quantifying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff changes. This study provides a new methodology for studying the impact of climate change and human activities on runoff changes, and the limited numbers of parameters make this methodology important for further applications to other basins elsewhere. Nevertheless, the physical interpretation should be made with caution and more comprehensive comparison work must be performed to assess the model's applicability. runoff; climate change; human activities; land-use change; machine-learning model; contribution;CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; BUDYKO HYPOTHESIS; WEI RIVER; IMPACT; CATCHMENT; WATER","Gender equality in climate policy and practice hindered by assumptions Gender has a powerful influence on experiences of, and resilience to, climate change. In this Review, the authors provide an overview of four common gender assumptions, and offer four suggestions for a more informed pursuit of gender equality in climate change policy and practice. Gender has a powerful influence on people's experience of, and resilience to, climate change. Global climate change policy is committed to tackling gender inequalities in mitigation and adaptation. However, progress is hindered by numerous challenges, including an enduring set of gender assumptions: women are caring and connected to the environment, women are a homogenous and vulnerable group, gender equality is a women's issue and gender equality is a numbers game. We provide an overview of how these assumptions essentialize women's and men's characteristics, narrowly diagnose the causes of gender inequality, and thereby propel strategies that have unintended and even counterproductive consequences. We offer four suggestions for a more informed pursuit of gender equality in climate change policy and practice. nan;WOMENS EMPOWERMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; REDD PLUS; COMMUNITY FORESTRY; LESSONS; POWER; INSIGHTS; QUOTAS; TECHNOLOGY; SERVICES","Lifecycle environmental and economic performance of nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB) in Ireland Directives in the European Union are ensuring that buildings in this region are moving towards nearly zero energy buildings (NZEB). For countries like Ireland, which has a temperate oceanic climate, a key to achieving NZEB is to have high thermal and air tightness performances of the building envelope. Consequently, as the operational energy of the building reduces, the embodied energy (and embodied global warming potential) typically increases as a proportion of the lifecycle energy of the building due to increased embodied energy of the building envelope and the lower operational energy. In order to assess if a design strategy is in fact sustainable, it is becoming essential to evaluate environmental and economic LCA of building design strategies. This paper presents the outcomes of a number of case study buildings in Ireland, which focuses on the full environmental and economic lifecycle assessment of buildings to assess the impact changes in building regulations are having on the contribution of both the construction and operation of a building's lifecycle as they move towards NZEB standards. If designed with a focus on achieving a high thermal and air tightness, a building with an embodied energy intensity less than a building that achieves compliance with 2011 Irish building energy performance regulations can achieve a NZEB standard.

This paper provides an assessment of the technology transfers that take place through the CDM using a data set of 644 registered projects. It provides a detailed description of the transfers (frequency, type, by sector, by host country, etc.). It also includes all econometric analysis of their drivers. We show that transfer likeliness increases with the size of the projects. The transfer probability is 50% higher in projects implemented in a subsidiary of Annex 1 companies while the presence of an official credit buyer has a lower-albeit positive-impact. The analysis also yields interesting results on how technological capabilities of the host country influence technology diffusion in the CDM. ","Assessments of Impacts of Climate Change and Human Activities on Runoff with SWAT for the Huifa River Basin, Northeast China The impacts of climate change and human activates on the runoff for Huifa River Basin, Northeast China, have been investigated with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), which is calibrated and verified for the baseline period 1956-1964, and then used to reconstruct the natural runoff from 1965 to 2005. The results indicate that both climate change and human activities are responsible for the decrease of observed runoff in Huifa River. The climate change could result in a decrease or increase of runoff depending on precipitation, temperature, radiation variation, as well as land cover changes. Its impacts on annual runoff are -36.7, -59.5, +36.9 and -45.2 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995 and 1996-2005, respectively, compared with the baseline period 1956-1964. Human activities, on the other hand, generally lead to a decrease of runoff and a relatively larger magnitude than climate change after 1985. It has decreased the annual runoff by -32.9, -46.8, -67.8 and -54.9 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995 and 1996-2005, respectively. Human activities contributed more to runoff decrease in wet years due to regulation and storage of the water projects. The results of this study could be a reference for regional water resources management since there are quite a number of reservoirs in the Huifa River basin.

The spatial and temporal distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) under different water-carbon regulation scenarios were analyzed on the basis of field experiments in the Taihu Lake region in China to explore the effects of biochar application on SOC and its components in water-saving irrigation paddy fields. The response of soil catalase (CAT) and invertase (INV) to biochar application in water-saving irrigated rice fields was clarified. The results showed that water-saving irrigation reduced the SOC content by 5.7% to 13.3% but increased WSOC and SMBC contents by 13.8% to 26.1% and 0.9% to 11.1%, respectively, as compared with flooding irrigation. Nonflooding management promoted the oxidative decomposition of soil organic matter. Two years after straw biochar was added, paddy soil SOC content under water-saving irrigation was increased by 4.0% to 26.7%. The WSOC and SMBC contents were also increased by 4.0% to 52.4% and 7.0% to 40.8%, respectively. The high straw biochar addition rate exhibited great impact on SOC. Remarkable correlations among SOC, WSOC, and SMBC were observed, indicating that the addition of straw biochar improved soil labile C, such as WSOC and SMBC, which promoted SOC transformation and stability in paddy soil under water-saving irrigation. Soil CAT and INV were related to SOC conversion. In conclusion, the combination of water-saving irrigation and straw biochar addition was beneficial to the improvement of soil properties and fertility of paddy fields. paddy fields; straw biochar; water-saving irrigation; soil organic carbon; soil enzyme activity;BLACK CARBON; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPIRATION; BIOMASS; STORAGE; FRACTIONS; STABILITY; EMISSION; DYNAMICS","Climate Change Adaptation at the Intersection of Food and Health Nutritious, safe, affordable, and enjoyable food is a fundamental prerequisite for health. As a nation, Australia is currently classified as food secure with the domestic production exceeding domestic consumption of most major food groups. The domestic system is almost self-sufficient in terms of nutritious plant foods, although these foods have seen steady higher price increases relative to other foods, with nutrition equity implications. However, the viability of Australia's food security sits counter to the continued presence of a stable and supportive climate. This article reviews the current state of science concerning the interface between climate change, food systems, and human health to reveal the key issues that must be addressed if Australia is to advance human health and sustainable food systems under a changing climate. climate change adaptation; food security; human health;SECURITY; EQUITY","Rainfall-triggered mass movements on steep loess slopes and their entrainment and distribution Mass movements are predominant geomorphic processes on steep hillslopes. However, the mechanisms governing the erosion and entrainment of mass movements remain poorly understood. In this study, experiments on natural loess slopes were conducted to induce a series of mass movements under simulated rainfalls in the Liudaogou Catchment on the Loess Plateau of China. A novel topography meter was used to observe random mass movements. A total of 499 mass movements in 42 rainfall events and an average of 11 mass movements for each rainfall event were observed. Three mass movement types were detected: landslides (67%) > mudflows (21%) > avalanches (12%). The volume of landslides dramatically increased through the entrainment of a wet gully bed material, and the volume of landslide mass was magnified by 29% on average through material entrainment. Based on the observed data, the probability of mass movement occurrences decreased with the increasing mass movement volume in a power-law relationship. The critical rainfall amount for mass movement failure was approximately 25.6 mm at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h(-1) . These results can serve as guides to mitigate geological hazards and assess erosion processes on steep loess slopes of the Loess Plateau.

The geo-climatic conditions are a major cause for higher flood damages in Indian states. This study employs the pooled mean group (PMG) approach to examine economic growth in the aftermath of floods in 14 non-special category states in India using flood disaster data over the period 1981-2011. The PMG estimates show that flood impacts in terms of area affected, the population affected, and economic losses due to floods decline real per capita GSDP growth in the long run after taking into account growth-enhancing factors. Moreover, instrumental variables (IV)-two-stage least-squares (2SLS) estimates also confirm that states experience lower real per capita GSDP growth due to higher flood impacts. The results, further, show that higher urbanization and enrollment of higher education increases real per capita GSDP growth in the long run. For robustness check, the study investigates the impact of floods on real per capita GSDP growth after taking into account government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption. The PMG and IV-2SLS estimates produce same results and confirm that flood impacts reduce real per capita GSDP growth, while government capital expenditure and per capita power consumption enhances real per capita GSDP growth. Overall, results confirm that flood management policies are essential to minimize the adverse impacts of floods on the growth of real per capita GSDP.

The persistence of the supply-side management philosophy within current political economies is also reviewed, along with infrastructure and institutional responses to the challenges (e. g., IWRM, dams, treaties). An analytical frame developed from the review is applied to three basins where there has been successful, considerable, or no effort at transboundary basin management: the Rhine, the Nile, and the Euphrates. International politics and national self-interest are found to be the key challenge facing international basins, though each of the challenges is interconnected and should be considered in combination. If transboundary basin management is to confront the challenges successfully, it should develop along two paths: away from a supply-side management paradigm toward adaptive management, and away from sovereignty and unilateralism to multilateralism. While infrastructure built under a paradigm of reducing uncertainty is found to reduce the adaptation options set, adaptive management that can make the most of the increasingly diverse governance and confront the supply-management philosophy is seen as best-suited to meet future challenges. The disabling effect of sovereignty and international politics may best be addressed by confronting resistance of the promotion of 'shared sovereignty' and fair water-sharing.

In spite of this attention, many aspects about the ES concept have remained controversial to date, i.e., their classification, value, generation, link to human well-being, and supportive role as management tool. This review explores the knowledge status of ecosystem services, focusing on those services generated in coastal and marine environments (CMES). A knowledge gap and an underdevelopment of tools to assess CMES is evident in the literature, especially when compared to the progress done in the assessment of land ES. Possible explanations reside on the yet small proportion that the research done on CMES represents for the ecosystem service framework (ESF), in part due to the intrinsic challenges of researching the marine environment, also due to the limited availability of spatial data on marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, the ES concept is getting more attention toward policy-makers and stakeholders, leading to the implementation of an ecosystem services approach (ESA) to the management and protection of CMES. Six lessons are rescued from the literature to improve the ESA: (1) integration of the ESA in a science-policy process; (2) more simplicity for the CMES prediction models; (3) move toward empowering of stakeholders; (4) integration of the value pluralism of CMES with less focus on money; (5) the link of ES to Human Well-being must not been forgotten; and (6) communication of results and social literacy are key. coastal and marine ecosystem services; ecosystem service approach; ecosystem services framework; human well-being; policy making;CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; DECISION-MAKING; ECONOMIC VALUATION; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; TRADE-OFFS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; MANGROVE CONSERVATION; ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS; POVERTY ALLEVIATION","Vulnerability, good governance, or donor interests? The allocation of aid for climate change adaptation Developed countries provide increasing amounts of aid to assist developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. How do they distribute this aid? While donors agreed to prioritise ""particularly vulnerable"" countries, we know from the general aid allocation literature that donors (also) use aid as a foreign policy tool to promote their own economic and political goals. In this paper, we analyse data on bilateral adaptation aid from 2010 through 2015 to assess to what extent adaptation aid is provided in response to recipient need (that is, vulnerability to climate change impacts) as opposed to recipient merit (that is, good governance) and donors' interests. In contrast to previous research, we find that donors partly take into account vulnerability to climate change. Countries that are physically more exposed to climate change tend to be more likely to receive some adaptation aid and also receive more adaptation aid per capita, as do poorer countries, small island developing states and to a lesser extent least developed countries. Countries with lower adaptive capacity, however, do not receive more adaptation aid; instead, donors reward well-governed countries with adaptation aid as well as use adaptation aid to promote their own economic interests. Furthermore, adaptation aid flows very closely follow general development aid flows. The extent to which adaptation aid is new and additional thus remains unclear. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Using interviews, policy document analysis, and participant observation, we identify climate and weather information needs, barriers to use, and opportunities to provide better information to these users. We found that the research and management communities need guidance on how to interpret and apply existing information. Climate information needs in the PPR are driven by the need to understand how projected changes in precipitation will impact prairie wetland ecology. Primary needs include guidance towards selecting, interpreting, and using various climate information products to understand impacts and explanations of the differences between new products and previously available information. Another need includes information on how the societal responses to climate change will further impact ecological systems. Existing management priorities, limited institutional resources, and limited ecological data are remaining barriers that can be ameliorated by leveraging existing policy processes or trusted sources of information to provide guidance, thereby reducing time and costs associated with using climate information in wildlife policy planning. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of the social and ecological aspects of the decision-making context to shape climate information needs, barriers, and entry points. Additional research is needed on the diverse ways that users engage with and use climate information, and additional efforts are needed to co-produce guidance documents that interpret climate information for management and research communities.

While the IPCC will continue to lead Earth System projections for global issues such as greenhouse gas levels and global temperature increase, high-resolution regional Earth System predictions will be crucial for producing effective decision-making tools for day-to-day, sustainable Earth System management and adaptive management of resources. Regional Earth System predictions and projections at the order of a few meters resolution from days to decades must be validated and provide uncertainties and skill scores to be usable. While the task is daunting, it would be criminally negligent of the global human not to embark on this task immediately. The observational needs for the integrated natural-human system for the regional Earth System are distinct from the global needs even though there are many overlaps. The process understanding of the Earth System at the micro scale can be translated into predictive understanding and skillful predictions for sustainable management by merging these observations with Earth System models to go from global scale predictions and projections to regional environmental manifestations and mechanistic depiction of human interactions with the Earth System and exploitation of its resources. Regional Earth System monitoring and predictions thus will continuously take the pulse of the planet to prescribe appropriate actions for participatory decision-making for sustainable and adaptive management of the Earth System and to avoid catastrophic domains of potential outcomes. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; PUBLIC-HEALTH; INFECTIOUS-DISEASE; EL-NINO; FORECASTS; UNCERTAINTY; WEATHER; ENVIRONMENT; COMPLEXITY; THINKING","Ecosystem service multifunctionality of low-productivity forests and implications for conservation and management Low-productivity forests are often the last remaining pristine forests in managed forest landscapes and typically overrepresented among protected forests. However, the provisioning of individual and multiple ecosystem services (ES-multifunctionality) by these forests remains poorly assessed, making it difficult to evaluate their importance in forest conservation and management. Here, using nationwide data on ES from over 2,000 forest plots, we test whether levels of ES-multifunctionality and individual ES differ between low-productivity forested mires and rocky outcrops in relation to the levels of productive forests, and as a function of forest age, tree species richness and climate. We defined ES-multifunctionality using different threshold values of the maximum levels (low, medium and high) and weighted these according to land-use objectives (equal weight of all services, greater weight to cultural and supporting ES or greater weight to production). We show that the ES-multifunctionality of forested mires is consistently lower than those of productive forests. However, the ES-multifunctionality increased with forest age in forested mires but not in productive forests. The ES-multifunctionality of forested rocky outcrops, on the other hand, was higher or equivalent to that of productive forests under equal weight and supporting land-use objectives, respectively. Our findings highlight that forested rocky outcrops can supply multiple ES, especially older forested stands with mixtures of coniferous and deciduous trees. Generally, we found no evidence for strong trade-offs between the ES studied and our results highlight the importance of forest age for increasing the ES-multifunctionality of low-productivity forests. Synthesis and applications. Low-productivity forests should not be exempt of forestry or protected purely based on low productivity or low land-use conflict if the goal is to conserve multiple ecosystem services (ES). Inclusion grounds for protecting low-productivity forests should instead carefully consider the site type (dry vs. wet), forest age and tree species richness. To maintain higher ES-multifunctionality in low-productivity forests, older or deciduous trees should also not be harvested. This will require changes in current conservation or management policies of low-productivity forests of some countries. ecosystem service multifunctionality; forest biodiversity; forest conservation and management; forest productivity; forested mire; forested rocky outcrop; low-productivity forest; Pinus sylvestris;CITIZEN SCIENCE DATA; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY","Vulnerability of Subsistence Systems Due to Social and Environmental Change: A Case Study in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska Arctic Indigenous communities have been classified as highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The remoteness of Arctic communities, their dependence upon local species and habitats, and the historical marginalization of Indigenous peoples enhances this characterization of vulnerability. However, vulnerability is a result of diverse historical, social, economic, political, cultural, institutional, natural resource, and environmental conditions and processes and is not easily reduced to a single metric. Furthermore, despite the widespread characterization of vulnerability, Arctic Indigenous communities are extremely resilient as evidenced by subsistence institutions that have been developed over thousands of years. We explored the vulnerability of subsistence systems in the Cup'ik village of Chevak and Yup'ik village of Kotlik through the lens of the strong seasonal dimensions of resource availability. In the context of subsistence harvesting in Alaska Native villages, vulnerability may be determined by analyzing the exposure of subsistence resources to climate change impacts, the sensitivity of a community to those impacts, and the capacity of subsistence institutions to absorb these impacts. Subsistence resources, their seasonality, and perceived impacts to these resources were investigated via semi-structured interviews and participatory mapping-calendar workshops. Results suggest that while these communities are experiencing disproportionate impacts of climate change, Indigenous ingenuity and adaptability provide an avenue for culturally appropriate adaptation strategies. However, despite this capacity for resiliency, rapid socio-cultural changes have the potential to be a barrier to community adaptation and the recent, ongoing shifts in seasonal weather patterns may make seasonally specific subsistence adaptations to landscape particularly vulnerable.

However, studies sufficiently clarifying the dynamics of hydrological processes in relation to irrigation return flow are scarce. In this study, HYDRUS-2D/3D model was used to analyze four irrigation development scenarios in Aksu River Basin, a major tributary of Tarim River. The study determined the effect of agricultural water saving on the dynamics of irrigation return flow in the basin. The results showed that for the 1990s, the irrigation return flow coefficient for flood irrigation was 0.50. This suggested that 50% of the water used in irrigation returned as discharge in the lower reaches. With increasing water scarcity, irrigation amount dropped while drip irrigation with plastic mulch was intensified. Accordingly, the irrigation return flow coefficient dropped from 0.44 in the 2000s to 0.34 in the 2010s under flood irrigation and from 0.42 to 0.23 under drip irrigation. With the drastic drop, irrigation was no longer enough to stabilize soil salinity in the region. The recent irrigation plan requires further reduction in irrigation amount. Based on the projected effects of the new irrigation scheme on soil salt build-up, an optimized irrigation scheme showed that the irrigation return flow coefficient should remain at 0.25. And with the use of water-saving technology, irrigation return flow has dropped from 594.01 mm in the 1990s to 164.62 mm in the 2010s, which should be maintained at 186.37 mm for the sustainability of the optimized irrigation scheme. The study also suggested that salinity was increasing in the downstream water systems due to irrigation return flow from land reclamation and water saving. This was a potential threat to the fragile riparian ecosystems in the study area. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of these indices of vulnerability to climate change have been primarily used for awareness-raising purposes rather than for guiding international policy. The Physical Vulnerability to Climate Change Index (PVCCI) proposed in this paper has been designed as an index of exogenous vulnerability, not influenced by the present policy of the countries concerned. As such it can be used as a criterion for guiding the international allocation of concessional resources (in particular those devoted to adaptation), as well as for the identification of the countries that are most vulnerable for structural or physical reasons. The index has been calculated for 191 countries. LDCs, SIDS, and African countries have a higher average score. However, there is a wide disparity in PVCCI scores within these three groups of countries, implying that a country-by-country allocation of resources should be used rather than an allocation by country group. The findings appear to be robust after comparison of various options.

Extant species of marine turtles probably arose during the mid-late Jurassic period (180-150 Mya) so have survived past shifts in climate, including glacial periods and warm events and therefore have some capacity for adaptation. The present-day rates of increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and associated temperature changes, are very rapid; the capacity of marine turtles to adapt to this rapid change may be compromised by their relatively long generation times. We consider the evidence and likely consequences of present-day trends of climate change on marine turtles. Impacts are likely to be complex and may be positive as well as negative. For example, rising sea levels and increased storm intensity will negatively impact turtle nesting beaches; however, extreme storms can also lead to coastal accretion. Alteration of wind patterns and ocean currents will have implications for juveniles and adults in the open ocean. Warming temperatures are likely to impact directly all turtle life stages, such as the sex determination of embryos in the nest and growth rates. Warming of 2 degrees C could potentially result in a large shift in sex ratios towards females at many rookeries, although some populations may be resilient to warming if female biases remain within levels where population success is not impaired. Indirectly, climate change is likely to impact turtles through changes in food availability. The highly migratory nature of turtles and their ability to move considerable distances in short periods of time should increase their resilience to climate change. However, any such resilience of marine turtles to climate change is likely to be severely compromised by other anthropogenic influences. Development of coastlines may threaten nesting beaches and reproductive success, and pollution and eutrophication is threatening important coastal foraging habitats for turtles worldwide. Exploitation and bycatch in other fisheries has seriously reduced marine turtle populations. The synergistic effects of other human-induced stressors may seriously reduce the capacity of some turtle populations to adapt to the current rates of climate change. Conservation recommendations to increase the capacity of marine turtle populations to adapt to climate change include increasing population resilience, for example by the use of turtle exclusion devices in fisheries, protection of nesting beaches from the viewpoints of both conservation and coastal management, and increased international conservation efforts to protect turtles in regions where there is high unregulated or illegal fisheries (including turtle harvesting). Increasing research efforts on the critical knowledge gaps of processes influencing population numbers, such as identifying ocean foraging hotspots or the processes that underlie the initiation of nesting migrations and selection of breeding areas, will inform adaptive management in a changing climate. nan;LOGGERHEAD SEA-TURTLES; NEST-SITE SELECTION; PACIFIC LEATHERBACK TURTLES; GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; OLIVE RIDLEY TURTLE; CO2-DRIVEN OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; NINO SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; CONFER FITNESS BENEFITS; DERMOCHELYS-CORIACEA L; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS","An examination of trans-Arctic vessel routing in the Central Arctic Ocean As the Arctic continues to warm, summer sea ice will continue to recede and a greater expanse of Arctic waters will become navigable. These changes may result in an increase in vessel traffic to the region, including via the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR), through the high seas area of the central Arctic Ocean (CAO). This paper begins with a review of the literature on Arctic vessel traffic to assess the potential effects of various stressors related to vessel traffic in the Arctic Ocean. Available data concerning environmental and safety risks for the Arctic Ocean are used to propose vessel TSR vessel traffic routes that can reduce those risks. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of several examples of vulnerability assessments focused on impacts from vessel traffic in the Arctic as potential models for future work specific to the CAO. The results from this review indicate vessel oiling, air pollution, and noise from icebreakers are immediate concerns to the Arctic Ocean that will likely worsen as the region becomes more navigable and vessel traffic increases. The proposed vessel routes for the Arctic Ocean are meant to serve as a starting point for further discussions before the region becomes fully navigable. As additional data become available, these efforts can be refined further, and a rigorous vulnerability assessment may become possible. Designation as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area under international law could provide a useful mechanism for creating and updating precautionary shipping measures as more information becomes available.

In order to update the yield response function of N, to make it better suited to current grassland farming, field experiments were conducted at two sites in 2015-2017 with two cultivars of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and one of meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.). Dry matter (DM) yield, nutritive value and N balance were evaluated, with N application levels 0, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). The grasses were harvested three times per season. The data indicate that the DM yield response was significantly stronger, and N was used more efficiently for DM production than earlier without compromising the nutritive value, especially during the first two years. The third harvest produced on average 23% of the annual yield, utilizing N efficiently. N application rates below 350 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) did not cause substantial overwintering losses or lodging. The data indicate that with changing climate and improved cultivars and management practices, there is a need to modify the rates and timing of N application. The results suggest that N application levels could be increased by at least 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) from the current maximum accepted rate (250 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) without too high NO3- or CP concentrations in feed, or too high N balance that indicates increasing risk of N leaching. fertilizer; Festuca spp; grasses; nitrogen balance; silage; timothy;PHLEUM-PRATENSE; FERTILIZER APPLICATION; GROWTH; YIELD; NITRATE; IMPACT","Nontraditional settlement patterns and typhoon hazard on contemporary Majuro Atoll, republic of the Marshall Islands Low-lying islands and atolls are particularly prone to storm surges created by tropical depressions and typhoons. This paper presents a case study of traditional and contemporary settlement patterns of Majuro, the capital of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and discusses its vulnerability to such storm surges. The paper shows that the application of traditional knowledge extends to the realm of urban planning and that, in fact, ignoring this traditional knowledge as expressed in pre-World War II settlement patterns. exposes urban development to increased flood hazards, a risk which may exact a price too high in life and property. town planning; environmental considerations; heritage settlement patterns; climatic extremes; human habitation impact; Pacific Islands; Marshall Islands; urbanization;CYCLONES","Analysis of the effect of environmental protected areas on land-use and carbon storage in a megalopolis Carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems plays a vital role in climate control. However, urban expansion and damage to natural areas, especially the rise of megalopolises, have affected carbon storage. To mitigate this damage, various policies have been established by international, domestic, and local governments. This study focuses on the establishment and management of environmental protection areas and analyzes their impact on carbon storage. The study targets the cities of Gyeonggi-do province, South Korea, which make up a representative megalopolis, and the effectiveness of protected areas was analyzed by typifying the cities based on the proportion of available development areas and environmentally protected areas. In this study, the SLEUTH (Slope, Land-use, Excluded Area, Urban, Transportation, Hillshade) land-use change model was used to predict future land-use changes, and carbon storage was estimated using the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) Carbon model. When operating the model, we tested a control group scenario that only preserves the water zone, a scenario that preserves the legally protected areas, and a scenario that protects the areas with high environmental value. There are two significant effects of setting up protected areas: First, the ""development inhibition effect"" of reducing the development area itself. Second, the ""development replacement effect"" of moving development to relatively low environmental value areas. These two effects differ depending on the availability of development areas, with ""development replacement effects"" prominent in areas with high development availability and ""development inhibition effects"" predominant in areas with low development availability. Future policies for setting up and managing protected areas can be used in megalopolis in conjunction with policies focusing on securing the area of carbon sinks.

The risk periods of infection by Paramphistomum trematoda in cattle was assessed by analyzing the prevalence of paramphistomosis, egg-output and climatic data. A significantly higher percentage of cattle passing trematode eggs by faeces was recorded firstly in September and secondly in March. The greatest numbers of eggs were achieved in May. Finally, the individual average prevalence was 19% and 36% of the farms had Calicophoron daubneyi-positive cattle. We conclude that the periods of high risk for C. daubneyi infection in areas with oceanic climate are those following periods with elevated rainfall, which occurs in May-June and November-December in these areas. Appropriate measures for reducing the risk for paramphistomosis are needed and the administration of chemotherapy with efficient anthelmintic in June and in November is strongly recommended. nan;LYMNAEA-TRUNCATULA; FASCIOLA-HEPATICA; CENTRAL FRANCE","Wind and Wave Setup Contributions to Extreme Sea Levels at a Tropical High Island: A Stochastic Cyclone Simulation Study for Apia, Samoa Wind-wave contributions to tropical cyclone (TC)-induced extreme sea levels are known to be significant in areas with narrow littoral zones, particularly at oceanic islands. Despite this, little information exists in many of these locations to assess the likelihood of inundation, the relative contribution of wind and wave setup to this inundation, and how it may change with sea level rise (SLR), particularly at scales relevant to coastal infrastructure. In this study, we explore TC-induced extreme sea levels at spatial scales on the order of tens of meters at Apia, the capitol of Samoa, a nation in the tropical South Pacific with typical high-island fringing reef morphology. Ensembles of stochastically generated TCs (based on historical information) are combined with numerical simulations of wind waves, storm-surge, and wave setup to develop high-resolution statistical information on extreme sea levels and local contributions of wind setup and wave setup. The results indicate that storm track and local morphological details lead to local differences in extreme sea levels on the order of 1 m at spatial scales of less than 1 km. Wave setup is the overall largest contributor at most locations; however, wind setup may exceed wave setup in some sheltered bays. When an arbitrary SLR scenario (+1 m) is introduced, overall extreme sea levels are found to modestly decrease relative to SLR, but wave energy near the shoreline greatly increases, consistent with a number of other recent studies. These differences have implications for coastal adaptation strategies. storm surge; coral reefs; waves; sea level; islands; climate; tropical cyclone;nan","Big Data for Remote Sensing: Challenges and Opportunities Every day a large number of Earth observation (EO) spaceborne and airborne sensors from many different countries provide a massive amount of remotely sensed data. Those data are used for different applications, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, etc. The applications are data driven and mostly interdisciplinary. Based on this it can truly be stated that we are now living in the age of big remote sensing data. Furthermore, these data are becoming an economic asset and a new important resource in many applications. In this paper, we specifically analyze the challenges and opportunities that big data bring in the context of remote sensing applications. Our focus is to analyze what exactly does big data mean in remote sensing applications and how can big data provide added value in this context. Furthermore, this paper describes the most challenging issues in managing, processing, and efficient exploitation of big data for remote sensing problems. In order to illustrate the aforementioned aspects, two case studies discussing the use of big data in remote sensing are demonstrated. In the first test case, big data are used to automatically detect marine oil spills using a large archive of remote sensing data. In the second test case, content-based information retrieval is performed using high-performance computing (HPC) to extract information from a large database of remote sensing images, collected after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center in New York City. Both cases are used to illustrate the significant challenges and opportunities brought by the use of big data in remote sensing applications.

However, considerable uncertainty remains regarding the role that climate variability and change play among the many drivers of migration and conflict. The overall objective of this paper is to explore the potential pathways linking climate change, migration and increased risk of conflict. We review the existing literature surrounding this issue and break the problem into two components: the links between climate change and migration, and those between migration and conflict. We found a large range of views regarding the importance of climate change as a driver for increasing rates of migration and subsequently of conflict. We argue that future research should focus not only on the climate-migration-conflict pathway but also work to understand the other pathways by which climate variability and change might exacerbate conflict. We conclude by proposing five questions to help guide future research on the link between climate change, migration, and conflict. climate change; migration; conflict;NATURAL DISASTERS; ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION; ETHNIC-CONFLICT; ARMED CONFLICT; ADAPTATION; SECURITY; DROUGHT; WEATHER; CRISIS; IMPACT","The Relationship Between Perceptions of Wilderness Character and Attitudes Toward Management Intervention to Adapt Biophysical Resources to a Changing Climate and Nature Restoration at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks In a recent national survey of federal wilderness managers, respondents identified the high priority need for scientific information about public attitudes toward biophysical intervention to adapt to climate change and attitudes of the public toward restoration of natural conditions. In a survey of visitors to one National Park wilderness in California, visitors revealed that they largely do not support biophysical intervention in wilderness to mitigate the effects of climate change, but broad support for activities that restore natural conditions exists. In an attempt to understand how these attitudes vary among visitors, it was found that those visitors who most value naturalness aspects of wilderness character also most positively support restoration and are most negative toward climate change intervention practices. More information about visitor-defined wilderness character attributes is needed and strategic planning to guide intervention decisions and restoration should be a priority. In this study, it was found that wilderness character is largely defined by visitors based on its wildness attributes, which include natural sounds, low density of people, pure water, clean air, and the presence of humans substantially unnoticeable.

Dune spits of the island of Sylt (North Sea) persisted through millennia by mobile dunes transferring sand from exposed to sheltered shores. However, 150years of systematic planting on washovers, blowouts and migrant dunes have almost completely stopped this sand conveyor belt. Spits lost sand until sand replenishments to the exposed side compensated for losses during the last three decades. Based on maps since 1878, aerial images from the 1930s onward as well as botanical ground surveys, we document a long-term shift from loose grass cover to dense heather dominated vegetation. Bare sand areas almost vanished and high shrubs proliferated. Only three dunes continue migrating with about 3m a(-1) since 1936. Mainly artificial dune stabilizations and introduced plants have facilitated succession to an almost complete plant cover. Thus, revitalization of aeolian dynamics would be desirable, and pilot projects may acquire the appropriate knowledge. For a 1.7x2.5-km corridor across the island spit, we therefor discuss two suggested experiments: (1) intensify sand nourishments to the eroding beach and stop stabilization measures to allow excess sand blown inland and washovers entering deflation plains, and (2) examine the potential of tunnels for roads to let mobile dunes passing over. Such experiments may not only contribute to dune biodiversity but also to long-ranging adaptations of crowded barrier islands to accelerating sea level rise.

Climate change will drive migration both within and across nations' borders, requiring some temporary and permanent resettlement. Despite the relative novelty of - and growing need for - climate-driven migration, it is unknown whether or how support for climate refugees' plight differs to other refugees. We examine attitudes of people living in the United States (N = 1765) towards refugee policy that experimentally differs in three respects: the type of refugees (international climate refugees, internal climate refugees, or refugees of war), the length of their stay (permanent or temporary), and their numbers (capped or increasing annually). While specific dis-cussion about climate refugee policy cites fears of 'opening the floodgates', we found no evidence that people were reluctant to support climate refugees when their numbers were going to increase each year compared to when they would remain capped. Instead, ratings did not depend on refugee numbers or refugee permanence. None of these factors interacted, indicating that resistance to migration is contingent only on the group: Proposals to support international climate refugees were supported less than proposals to support internal climate refugees or refugees of war. Responses to a question asking which countries participants expected international climate refugees to relocate from suggests a wide variety of expected origins, and these geographic origins may shape ratings of support and perceived threat to the economy and culture if refugees resettle in the United States. Overall, our findings highlight the greater support and sympathy afforded to groups already living in the United States.

Accordingly, many smart city assessment frameworks and/or indicator sets have been developed in the last decade. To guide actors and stakeholders in their selection of the most suitable frameworks, several studies have examined contents and structure of smart city assessment frameworks or indicator sets. Such studies have significantly improved our understanding of the thematic focus of assessment tools and their methodological approaches. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on the taxonomy of smart city indicators. In addition, since other concepts such as sustainability and resilience are increasingly recognized to be connected to the smart city concept, more clarity on how different assessment frameworks or indicator sets are aligned with sustainability and resilience dimensions and characteristics is needed. To fill these gaps, we developed a taxonomy and examined 33 assessment frameworks or indicator sets in terms of indicator type, sectoral linkages, and alignment with sustainability and resilience dimensions and characteristics. In terms of indicator type, results show that output indicators are dominant but limited attention has been paid to impact indicators. In terms of sectoral focus, existing indicators are mainly related to information and communication technologies, economy, and governance. Regarding resilience abilities, indicators are mainly related to planning abilities and limited attention has been paid to recovery and adaptation. As for resilience characteristics, reasonable levels of alignment with resourcefulness and efficiency were observed, but indicators are not well-aligned with other important characteristics such as redundancy and diversity. Finally, in terms of sustainability, limited alignment with the environmental dimension was found, which raises concerns regarding the suitability of smart city indicators for guiding environmental sustainability and informing efforts aimed at addressing climate change issues. Results of this study can support interested stakeholders in their efforts to select the most suitable assessment frameworks or indicator sets for promoting resilient, smart, and sustainable communities.

Several years ago, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) established 6 general competencies in keeping with its mission to ensure and to improve the quality of graduate medical education as well as to ensure that physicians who graduate from training programs are adequately prepared to practice medicine in the changing health-care delivery system.(1) Before the implementation of these general competencies, similar practical residency evaluation tools had domains important to successful surgical resident performance.(2) These tools may have been effective in the evaluation of residents within a single training program; however, these evaluation tools were not mandatory and were program-specific. The ACGME outcomes project represented a standardization for all training programs on which accreditation of programs now depends. Residencies have been forced to adapt to the changing climate of resident education to meet the ACGME's requirements. In the past, application of the general competencies has been accomplished through slight modifications of existing educational conferences, including morning report and Morbidity and Mortality conferences. 1,4 Although organizations similar to the Trauma Support Group may exist in other surgical training programs, the application of the ACGME's general competencies for residency training has not been illustrated by the establishment of an organization formed by surgical residents. nan;nan","CERES-Maize model-based simulation of climate change impacts on maize yields and potential adaptive measures in Heilongjiang Province, China BACKGROUNDClimate change would cause negative impacts on future agricultural production and food security. Adaptive measures should be taken to mitigate the adverse effects. The objectives of this study were to simulate the potential effects of climate change on maize yields in Heilongjiang Province and to evaluate two selected typical household-level autonomous adaptive measures (cultivar changes and planting time adjustments) for mitigating the risks of climate change based on the CERES-Maize model. RESULTSThe results showed that flowering duration and maturity duration of maize would be shortened in the future climate and thus maize yield would reduce by 11-46% during 2011-2099 relative to 1981-2010. Increased CO2 concentration would not benefit maize production significantly. However, substituting local cultivars with later-maturing ones and delaying the planting date could increase yields as the climate changes. CONCLUSIONThe results provide insight regarding the likely impacts of climate change on maize yields and the efficacy of selected adaptive measures by presenting evidence-based implications and mitigation strategies for the potential negative impacts of future climate change. ","Cover of coastal vegetation as an indicator of eutrophication along environmental gradients Coastal vegetation communities are important for primary production, biodiversity, coastal protection, carbon and nutrient cycling which, in combination with their sensitivity to eutrophication, render them potential indicators of environmental status for environmental policies like the EU Water and Marine Strategy Framework Directives. We evaluated one potential indicator for coastal vegetation, the cumulative cover at depths where the vegetation is light limited, by investigating its response to eutrophication along gradients in natural conditions. We used a large data set covering the Swedish coastline, spanning broad gradients in nutrient level, water clarity, sea-bed substrate, physical exposure and climate in addition to a salinity gradient from 0.5 to 30.5. Macroalgal cover increased significantly along gradients of declining nutrient concentration and increasing water clarity when we had accounted for diver effects, spatio-temporal sampling variability, salinity gradients, wave exposure and latitude. The developed empirical model explained 79% of the variation in algal cover across 130 areas. Based on this, we identified macroalgal cover as a promising indicator across the Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak. A parallel analysis of soft-substrate macrophytes similarly identified significant increases in cover with decreasing concentrations of total nitrogen and increasing salinity, but the resulting empirical model explained only 52% of the variation in cover, probably due to the spatially more variable nature of soft-substrate vegetation. The identified general responses of vegetation cover to gradients of eutrophication across wide ranges in environmental settings may be useful for monitoring and management of marine vegetation in areas with strong environmental gradients. nan;EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; WATER TRANSPARENCY; AQUATIC VEGETATION; DEPTH; MACROALGAE; PATTERNS; COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEMS; ORGANISMS; ESTUARIES","Wilderness areas in a changing landscape: changes in land use, land cover, and climate Wilderness areas are not immune to changes in land use, land cover, and/or climate. Future changes will intensify the balancing act of maintaining ecological conditions and untrammeled character within wilderness areas. We assessed the quantitative and spatial changes in land use, land cover, and climate predicted to occur in and around wilderness areas by (1) quantifying projected changes in land use and land cover around wilderness areas; (2) evaluating if public lands surrounding wilderness areas can buffer future land-use change; (3) quantifying future climate conditions in and around wilderness areas; and (4) identifying wilderness areas expected to experience the most change in land use, land cover, and climate. We used projections of land use (four variables), land cover (five variables), and climate (nine variables) to assess changes for 707 wilderness areas in the contiguous United States by mid-21st century under two scenarios (medium-low and high). We ranked all wilderness areas relative to each other by summing and ranking decile values for each land use, land cover, and climate variable and calculating a multivariate metric of future change. All wilderness areas were projected to experience some level of change by mid-century. The greatest land-use changes were associated with increases in agriculture, clear cutting, and developed land, while the greatest land cover changes were observed for grassland, forest, and shrubland. In 51.6% and 73.8% of wilderness areas, core area of natural vegetation surrounding wilderness was projected to decrease for the medium-low and high scenarios, respectfully. Presence of public land did not mitigate the influence of land-use change around wilderness areas. Geographically, projected changes occurred throughout the contiguous U.S., with areas in the northeast and upper Midwest projected to have the greatest land-use and climate change and the southwestern U.S. projected to undergo the greatest land cover and climate change. Our results provide insights into potential future threats to wilderness areas and the challenges associated with wilderness stewardship and climate adaptation. Despite the high degree of protection and remoteness of wilderness areas, effective management and preservation of these lands must consider future changes in land use, land cover, and climate. climate change; land cover; land use; landscape; National Wilderness Preservation System; protected areas; wilderness;UNITED-STATES; EXTREME WEATHER; PROTECTED AREAS; PRESERVATION SYSTEM; FROST DAMAGE; HABITAT LOSS; FUTURE; BIODIVERSITY; FOREST; REPRODUCTION","Vegetation restoration dominated the variation of water use efficiency in China Implementation of numerous ecological restoration programs over the last two decades has significantly increased vegetation coverage in China. However, the response of the coupled carbon and water cycles to the large-scale vegetation restoration and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of regional gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency (WUE) in China using the two-leaf light use efficiency (TL-LUE) and the Priestley Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) models during the 2000-2017 period. The influencing mechanisms of anthropogenic revegetation and climatic factors on regional WUE were also analyzed. Results indicate that (1) both the GPP and WUE showed a significant increasing tendency with inter-annual change rates of 10.53 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.01 g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1), respectively; while the inter-annual change rate of annual ET was 1.43 kg H2O m(-2) yr(-1). (2) Spatially, the regional GPP dominated WUE variation of more than 79.51% of the total area. (3) Among the influencing factors, the greening of vegetation driven by human activities (LAI(h)) explained 35.27% of the WUE variation in China, much more than the climatic factors over during the study period. At the regional scale, human-driven vegetation greening also dominated the increasing WUE at regional scale.

The empirical analysis adopts an instrumental variable regression model that incorporates an endogenous interaction term to capture the intermediary role of institutional extension services. Results reveal that access to agricultural extension services enhances the relationship between DTM adoption and maize yield, output per capita, and consumption but appears to weaken the association between DTM adoption and the amount of maize set aside for sale. In exploring the potential reasons why access to institutional extension services might enhance the DTM adoption-livelihood outcomes relationship, the results suggest mechanisms related to the use of basal fertilizers, use of organic manure, access to agricultural credit, use of certified DTM seed, access to general production and marketing information, weeding frequency and disease control which are more likely to be influenced by access to agricultural extension services. The findings suggest that policies targeted at improving DTM adoption as a climate-smart agricultural technology to improve resilience of smallholder maize farming households to climate variability and change must be complemented by revitalized agriculture extension services. Revitalization of extension services may come through capacity building of extension institutions, and their personnel, improving agricultural extension infrastructure, mobility of extension personnel, and increased financing to such institutions.

This experience may be associated with attributions to climate change, as well as with pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions. Given the United States' (US) recent devastating wildfires and widespread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we conducted two national surveys (study 1: n = 502, study 2: n = 1,493) of US adults examining how subjective attribution is associated with personal experience with extremes, as well as with concern and subjective knowledge about climate change. We also examine the extent to which these factors are associated with pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions, and whether these relationships are amplified or attenuated by subjective attribution. We find that personal experience, concern, and subjective knowledge are associated with the belief that wildfires and COVID-19 are attributable to climate change. These in turn are all associated with pro-environmental attitudes (carbon tax policy support) and behavioral intentions (electric vehicle purchase). Subjective attribution of COVID-19 amplifies the positive relationship between personal experience with COVID-19 and electric vehicle purchase intentions (study 1 and 2), and subjective attribution of wildfire or COVID-19 amplifies the positive relationship between subjective knowledge and carbon tax policy support (study 2). These findings highlight the importance of personal experience and subjective attributions as they relate to individuals' intentions to perform pro-environmental actions and support policy.

It argues that mainstreaming operationalization necessitates a methodology that focuses on the challenges in applying the approach and an analytical framework that can examine the mainstreaming process from an institutional perspective. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applied triangulation by data method (i.e. document review, interview, survey and key informant consultations) and incorporated the scorecard approach in developing the four-stage mixed methodology. It used a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as primary analytical guide and applied the case study methodology for structure and focus in relation to data collection activities. Findings - This paper devised the four-stage mixed methodology and successfully applied it in examining the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. Using the methodology, this paper developed 20 quantitative ""mainstreaming indicators"" and generated qualitative analyses to assess the state of play of the challenges in local mainstreaming of CCA. Results suggest that mainstreaming challenges exist within a certain spectrum, with one end composed of barriers to, and the other, opportunities for CCA. Furthermore, the challenges occur at varying degrees of severity depending on the conditions that surround them. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to illustrating the process involved in developing the four-stage mixed methodology and presents only a brief discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results. Practical implications - Although the methodology is at its initial stages of development, it generated results that can help analysts, planners and decision-makers: determine the nature of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, thereby understand the mainstreaming process; prioritize the mainstreaming challenges to address; and design strategies that will maximize the use of limited resources (i.e. utilizing the opportunities to overcome the existing barriers), among others. Originality/value - The four-stage mixed methodology was developed to aid analysts, planners and decision-makers determine the state-of-play of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA and make informed decisions in overcoming these challenges. Thus, the mixed method can be a useful tool in advancing the operationalization of the mainstreaming approach.

The adaptation concept in the crimate change literature"" This critical review debates the issues raised in Bassett and Fogelman's 2013 article ""Deja vu or something new? The adaptation concept in the climate change literature"". After summarising the main findings of their article, we examine the methodology that Bassett and Fogelman adopted. We question the narrow sample of journals analysed, which we argue has led to a bias in the conclusions drawn. We use this opportunity to draw attention to the use of systematic literature reviews as an important methodological approach to synthesise the climate change adaptation literature. To demonstrate this we discuss the use of an alternate method more akin to that of a systematic literature review, and highlight where differences between this and the originally proposed methodology exist, and what this means for the concluding results.

We highlight one of the key challenges to resilience in environmental governance-coordinating governance processes within and across multiple interacting geographic levels-and investigate structures of local, regional, and multilevel water governance networks using empirical data from Central America. We examined hypotheses of multilevel governance network structure and function using descriptive statistics and exponential random graph models, and found that closed and open network structures are more prevalent at the local and regional levels, respectively, and that cross-level ties impart small-world structures upon the multilevel network. Small-world networks are theorized to provide joint benefits on cooperation, policy learning, and resource distribution, all of which are necessary for effective water resources governance. cooperation; environmental governance; multilevel governance; small-world networks; social learning;BUILDING ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; POLICY NETWORKS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WORLD; SCALE; COLLABORATION; CONSERVATION; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS","Attributing weather extremes to 'climate change': A review Over the last 30 years, scientific research has increasingly implicated human activities in contemporary regional- to global-scale climatic change. Over the last decade, this research has extended to the detection of the fingerprint of human activities on individual extreme weather events. Is it possible to say that this or that weather extreme was caused by' human activities? Pursuing answers to this question raises many difficult philosophical, epistemological and political issues. In this progress report, I survey the nascent science of extreme weather event attribution by examining the field in four stages: motivations for extreme weather attribution, methods of attribution, some example case studies and the politics of weather event attribution. There remain outstanding political dangers and obstacles for extreme weather attribution if it is to be used, as some claim it can and should be, for guiding climate adaptation investments, for servicing the putative loss and damage agenda of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or for underpinning legal claims for liability for damages caused by extreme weather. attribution; climate adaptation; climate change; extreme weather; loss and damage;TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY; EVENTS; SUMMER; TRENDS","Transgenerational plasticity mediates temperature effects on fitness in the water flea Daphnia magna Phenotypic plasticity is an important way by which organisms respond to changes in their local environment, but it is not clear whether parents can buffer the negative impacts of high temperature on offspring fitness. To investigate this question, we exposed the water flea Daphnia magna Straus, 1820 and their offspring to either low (15 degrees C) or high (25 degrees C) temperature in a crossed factorial design. High parental temperature reduced the age and size at reproductive maturation and resulted in smaller mean clutch size, regardless of offspring temperature. This suggests that parents did not buffer the effects of high temperature on their offspring. However, offspring raised at high temperature that came from parents also raised at high temperature had similar adult body size and longer lifespan than offspring produced by parents exposed to low temperature. As a consequence of these apparent trade-offs, there was no detectable effect of parental temperature on offspring lifetime reproductive success. These results suggest that although transgenerational plasticity could help organisms to cope with stressful changes in their local environment, such effects might be difficult to detect in natural populations due to associated life-history trade-offs. maternal effects; environmental matching; phenotypic plasticity; adaptation; life-history theory; Daphnia magna; water flea;PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; OFFSPRING SIZE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EGG SIZE; PSEUDOREPLICATION; PREDICTABILITY; ADAPTATION; EVOLUTION"
"3","From adaptation to climate-resilient development: The costs of climate-proofing the Millennium Development Goals in Africa Socio-economic development and adaptation to climate change are closely intertwined. Adaptation is sometimes described as climate-resilient development or development under a hostile climate. In support of this view, this paper estimates the combined cost of meeting and at the same time 'climate-proofing' the millennium development goals (MDGs) for Africa. Treating adaptation and development in an integrated way helps to better understand financing requirements analytically and, more importantly, to implement the requisite measures more effectively as part of an integrated development programme. We find that the external financing needed for 'climate-resilient' MDGs is about 40 per cent higher than the external financing for the MDGs alone - up to USD100 billion a year for the next decade, compared with USD72 billion a year for the MDGs alone. This estimate is indicative only and based on fairly cursory aggregate data. The next challenge would be to apply the integrated adaptation and development frameworks to concrete development strategies at the country level. adaptation to climate change; Africa; economic costs; millennium development goals; needs assessment;nan","Effects of Marsh Migration on Flooding, Saltwater Intrusion, and Crop Yield in Coastal Agricultural Land Subject to Storm Surge Inundation Low-lying coastlines are vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surge salinization, threatening the sustainability of coastal farmland. Most crops are intolerant of salinity, and minimization of saltwater intrusion is critical to crop preservation. Coastal wetlands provide numerous ecosystem services, including attenuation of storm surges. However, most research studying coastal protection by marshes neglects consideration of subsurface salinization. Here, we use two-dimensional, variable-density, coupled surface-subsurface hydrological models to explore how coastal wetlands affect surface and subsurface salinization due to storm surges. We evaluate how marsh width, surge height, and upland slope impact the magnitude of saltwater intrusion and the effect of marsh migration into farmland on crop yield. Results suggest that along topographically low coastlines subject to storm surges, marsh migration into agricultural fields prolongs the use of fields landward of the marsh while also protecting groundwater quality. Under a storm surge height of 3.0 m above mean sea level or higher and terrestrial slope of 0.1%, marsh migration of 200 and 400 m protects agricultural yield landward of the marsh-farmland interface compared to scenarios without migration, despite the loss of arable land. Economic calculations show that the maintained yields with 200 m of marsh migration may benefit farmers financially. However, yields are not maintained with migration widths over 400 m or surge height under 3.0 m above mean sea level. Results highlight the environmental and economic benefits of marsh migration and the need for more robust compensation programs for landowners incorporating coastal wetland development as a management strategy. agriculture; coastal wetlands; land management; marsh migration; saltwater intrusion;SEA-LEVEL RISE; CHESAPEAKE BAY; SALINITY; CARBON; EUTROPHICATION; CONVERSION; IMPACT; MODEL","Massive concrete elements for hydraulic structures in (climate) change Concrete structural elements in hydraulic engineering have to satisfy a wide range of durability aspects that have to be harmonized in design, concrete concept and execution. The current regulations on concrete composition have been developed from proven procedures in hydraulic engineering over decades. The measures to control climate change, but also the availability of resources in the field of concrete raw materials are currently resulting in considerable changes on the building materials market and will continue to do so in the future. Currently, the lack of availability of fly ash or the foreseeable decline in blastfurnace slag and cements containing blastfurnace slag must be mentioned here, which require rethinking and adaptation in the design and quality assurance of concrete in a comparatively short time. In the field of ""new construction of massive hydraulic structures"", concrete engineering is facing considerable challenges in this respect as well and requires an adaptation strategy. Ultimately, the question here is how construction can be carried out at all in the coming years. Based on current practices for ensuring durability, concepts are presented to show how these challenges in transport hydraulic engineering can be met in the future. The focus is not only on the building material concrete itself, but also on design and durability concepts as well as construction methods, such as zoned construction or construction with prefabricated elements. concrete; massive concrete elements; structural hydraulic engineering; durability; climate change;nan","Genetic differentiation in functional traits among wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) half-sib lines Understanding intra-specific variation in leaf functional traits is one of the key requirements for the evaluation of species adaptive capacity to ongoing climate change, as well as for designing long-term breeding and conservation strategies. Hence, data of 19 functional traits describing plant physiology, antioxidant properties, anatomy and morphology were determined on 1-year-old seedlings of wild cherry (Prunus avium L.) half-sib lines. The variability within and among half-sib lines, as well as the estimation of multi-trait association, were examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference test and multivariate analyses: principal component analysis (PCA), canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to evaluate linear correlation between the study parameters. The results of the ANOVA showed the presence of statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) among half-sib lines for all study traits. The differences within half-sib lines, observed through the contribution of the examined sources of variation to the total variance (%), had higher impact on total variation in the majority of the examined traits. Pearson's correlation analysis and PCA showed strong relationships between gas exchange in plants and leaf size and stomatal density, as well as between leaf biomass accumulation, intercellular CO2 concentration and parameters related to antioxidant capacity of plants. Likewise, the results of SDA indicate that transpiration and stomatal conductance contributed to the largest extent, to the discrimination of the wild cherry half-sib lines. In addition, PCA and CDA showed separation of the wild cherry half-sib lines along the first principal component and first canonical variable with regards to humidity of their original sites. Multiple adaptive differences between the wild cherry half-sib lines indicate high potential of the species to adapt rapidly to climate change. The existence of substantial genetic variability among the wild cherry half-sib lines highlights their potential as genetic resources for reforestation purposes and breeding programmes.

Thus, estimating water storage in alpine glaciers is critical for predicting the trend of glacier melting. This study compiled a rich set of ice thickness observations for glaciers of varying sizes in western China. We here presented a first-order assessment of the various errors involved in interpreting ice thickness from ground-penetrating radar (GPR) observations. An empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) method was used for ice thickness interpolation and volume estimation. We then established a new volume-scaling law specific to western China glaciers based on these 36 volume-area pairs. And together with the Second Chinese Glacier Inventory (SCGI), we obtain a regional volume estimate of 4451 +/- 298 km(3). By comparison, we believed that this result is the most reliable estimate of the total ice storage in western China and more reliably predicts gross glacier melting. However, our results show that the method of glacier division can strongly affect the total volume estimation, which previous studies ignored. This emphasizes the need for more surveyed glaciers data and more accurate glacier inventory to improve the evaluation of the climate impact on glacier melting water resources and to help ensure the future survival of these alpine glaciers.

This requires risk and adaptation assessments to be regularly reviewed and updated as needed, reflecting the new information but retaining useful information from earlier assessments. In this paper, updated guidance on the types of SLR information available is presented, including for sea-level extremes. An intercomparison of the evolution of the headline projected ranges across all the IPCC reports show an increase from the fourth and fifth assessments to the most recent ""Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate"" assessment. IPCC reports have begun to highlight the importance of potential high-end sea-level response, mainly reflecting uncertainties in the Greenland/Antarctic ice sheet components, and how this might be considered in scenarios. The methods that are developed here are practical and consider coastal risk assessment, adaptation planning, and long-term decision-making to be an ongoing process and ensure that despite the large uncertainties, pragmatic adaptation decisions can be made. It is concluded that new sea-level information should not be seen as an automatic reason for abandoning existing assessments, but as an opportunity to review (i) the assessment's robustness in the light of new science and (ii) the utility of proactive adaptation and planning strategies, especially over the more uncertain longer term.

Fortunately, it is largely a preventable risk. Reducing pollution at its source can have a rapid and substantial impact on health. Within a few weeks, respiratory and irritation symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough, phlegm, and sore throat, disappear; school absenteeism, clinic visits, hospitalizations, premature births, cardiovascular illness and death, and all-cause mortality decrease significantly. The interventions are cost-effective. Reducing factors causing air pollution and climate change have strong cobenefits. Although regions with high air pollution have the greatest potential for health benefits, health improvements continue to be associated with pollution decreases even below international standards. The large response to and short time needed for benefits of these interventions emphasize the urgency of improving global air quality and the importance of increasing efforts to reduce pollution at local levels. air pollution; particulate matter; health risks; environmental health;SOCIETIES ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITTEE; RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; BLOOD-PRESSURE; NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES; COOKSTOVE INTERVENTION; BIOGENIC EMISSIONS; STOVE INTERVENTION","Impact of heatwaves on daily outpatient visits of respiratory disease: A time stratified case-crossover study Objectives: This study aims to estimate the impact of heatwaves from July 2010 to October 2012 on daily outpatient visits for respiratory disease (RD) in Cangnan, China and identify vulnerable populations. Methods: The definition of heatwave was a period at least 3 consecutive days with maximum temperature exceeding 35 degrees C in this study. A time-stratified case-crossover design was conducted to examine the relationship between heatwaves and outpatient visits for RD. Patient data for the period from 2010 to 2012 were collected from the Third People's Hospital of Cangnan and daily meteorological data for the same period were collected from the China Meteorological Data Service Center. Data regarding the air pollution index (API), a composite indicator of air pollution, were collected from the Data Center of the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. RD were identified based on the 10th revision International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes (J00-J99). A conditional Poisson regression model was applied to examine the heatwave-RD association using the Relative Risk (RR) while adjusting for meteorological and air pollution factors including temperature, rainfall, wind speed, pressure, humidity, sunshine hours and API. Results: During the study period, 4 heatwaves occurred and a total of 1732 outpatient visits for RD were reported. Heatwaves increased the frequency of RD outpatient visits and the highest RR of total RD was 1.155% and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) was 1.084-1.232 at Lag 0. For subcategories, heatwaves increased the risk of infectious RD (Lag 0: RR = 1.182, 95% CI: 1.106-1.263) and decreased the risk of non-infectious RD ((Lag 6: RR = 0.750, 95% CI: 0.568-0.990). Moreover, heatwaves showed adverse effects on acute upper respiratory infection (Lag 0: RR = 1.306, 95% CI: 1.177-1.450). The RR of outpatient visits for RD was statistically significant in females (Lag 0: RR = 1.161, 95% CI: 1.046-1.298), males (Lag 4: RR = 1.161, 95% CI: 1.096-1.261), young people aged 4-17 years (Lag 0: RR = 1.741, 95% CI: 1.524-1.990) and elders aged 65 years or older (Lag 5: RR = 1.412, 95% CI: 1.111-1.794) during heatwaves. Conclusions: Heatwaves had a significant harmful impact on daily outpatient visits for RD in Cangnan, especially for vulnerable population identified. These results can be used not only to strengthen the health education and protection of these vulnerable populations, but also to assist relevant organizations with developing intervention programmes and improving disease prevention and community care.

Three key framings of ?agroforestry? are identified in the scholarship and explored for their differences. The findings suggest that the distinct schools of research on ?agroforestry? focus on distinct points of departure, and these baseline situations from which transitions to what is called ?agroforestry? occur vary in distinct ways from monoculture plantations to primary forests. Political-economic analysis is used to scrutinize three key ?agroforestry? transition categories: agroecological, agribusiness, and forest degradation, which the article identifies as agroecoforestry (the good), agrobizforestry (the bad), and agrodeforestry (the ugly) transitions, respectively. Examples of each type are provided based on field research in Brazil, and the results are put into a global perspective. The categories are helpful in identifying the ?agroforestry? transitions that are currently marketed as good solutions but might also have negative impacts and in highlighting the agroecological agroforestry transitions that would help simultaneously increase global food production, adapt to and mitigate the climate crisis, and achieve equity and social justice.

However, it is unclear if this advance coincidently causes weather pattern changes around heading and leads to yield loss. Using the Variety Trial and weather data in Fairbanks and Delta Junction (64.05 degrees N, 145.60 degrees W) from 1991 to 2018, two barley cultivars were selected to analyze the yield and weather trends, the yield variation explained by weather, and the effect of extreme weather on yield. The results showed that the heading date of 'Otal' significantly advanced and yield significantly declined in Fairbanks while there were no heading and yield changes of 'Otal' in Delta Junction and of 'Thual' in both Fairbanks and Delta Junction. The weather pattern changed around heading due to advanced heading of 'Otal' in Fairbanks. The climate factors at 7-10 days around heading explained over 50% of 'Otal' yield variation in Fairbanks. The results suggest that 'Otal' can still be good to plant in Delta Junction but not in Fairbanks. To cope with the climate change in Alaska, the farmers should increase the diversity of barley cultivars, select non-photoperiod sensitive cultivars and cultivars with longer duration from planting to heading, and sow late to avoid the impact on heading and yield. nan;Barley cultivars; Heading; Temperature and precipitation; Yield loss; Plants (botany); Barley cultivar; Climate factors; Extreme weather; Heading; Heading date; Pattern change; Temperature and precipitation; Weather data; Weather patterns; Yield loss; Climate change; barley; crop yield; cultivar; precipitation (climatology); weather; yield response; Alaska; Delta Junction; Fairbanks; United States","Life cycle assessment of MSW-to-energy schemes in Thailand Life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate environmental impacts of two municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy schemes currently practiced in Thailand: incineration and anaerobic digestion. Potential impacts such as global warming, acidification, stratospheric ozone depletion, and photo-oxidant formation were avoided due to net electricity production and also fertilizer production as by-products from the anaerobic digestion scheme. In addition, the anaerobic digestion resulted in the higher net energy output compared to the incineration scheme. However, the incineration had less potential impact for nutrient enrichment. The LCA results were also useful in determining where the improvements could be made for both the schemes. In order to adopt a sustainable waste management system elsewhere in the country, decision makers may need to consider a combination of techniques, or an integrated method of management. LCA could serve as an invaluable tool for such an analysis. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous researchers have studied climate change news coverage to assess accuracy in reporting and potential sources of bias. These studies typically rely on manually coding articles from a handful of prestigious outlets, not allowing comparisons with smaller newspapers or providing enough diversity to assess the influence of partisan orientation or localized climate vulnerability on content production. Making these comparisons, this study indicates that partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and vulnerability to climate change correlate with several topics present in U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change. After assembling a corpus of over 78,000 articles covering two decades from 52 U.S. newspapers that are diverse in terms of geography, partisan orientation, scale of circulation, and objectively measured climate risk, a coherent set of latent topics were identified via an automated content analysis of climate change news coverage. Topic model results indicate that while outlet bias does not appear to impact the prevalence of coverage for most topics surrounding climate change, differences were evident for some topics based on partisan orientation, scale, or vulnerability status, particularly those relating to climate change denial, impacts, mitigation, or resource use. Overall, this paper provides a comprehensive study of U.S. newspaper coverage of climate change and identifies specific topics where outlet bias constitutes an important contextual factor.

This program is in line with all projects the Algerian Government is implementing to improve its water sector performance. The water strategy focuses on desalination for the coastal cities, medium-sized dams to irrigate the inland mountains and high plateau, and ambitious water transfer projects interconnecting Algeria's 65 dams to bring water to water scarce parts of the country. Waste water treatment and water reclamation technologies are also highly sought after. The main objective of the country's water policy consists on providing sufficient potable water for the population supply. This objective is undertaken by increasing the water resources and availability.

Studies have examined the impact of climate or socio-ecological factors on dengue, or only analyzed the individual effects of each single factor on dengue transmission. However, little research has addressed the interactive effects by multiple factors on dengue incidence. This study uses the geographical detector method to investigate the interactive effect of climate and socio-ecological factors on dengue incidence from two perspectives: over a long-time series and during outbreak periods; and surmised on the possibility of dengue outbreaks in the future. Results suggest that the temperature plays a dominant role in the long-time series of dengue transmission, while socio-ecological factors have great explanatory power for dengue outbreaks. The interactive effect of any two factors is greater than the impact of single factor on dengue transmission, and the interactions of pairs of climate and socio-ecological factors have more significant impact on dengue. Increasing temperature and surge in travel could cause dengue outbreaks in the future. Based on these results, three recommendations are offered regarding the prevention of dengue outbreaks: mitigating the urban heat island effect, adjusting the time and frequency of vector control intervention, and providing targeted health education to travelers at the border points. This study hopes to provide meaningful clues and a scientific basis for policymakers regarding effective interventions against dengue transmission, even during outbreaks. Author summary Dengue is among the rapidly spreading vector-borne diseases and is widespread in tropical and subtropical areas. In China, dengue is a serious public health problem, especially in the southeastern regions with rapid urbanization, such as Guangzhou City. Since 1998, more than 40,000 dengue cases have been reported in Guangzhou. Dengue transmission is affected by multiple factors, including climate and different socio-ecological factors. This study indicates that temperature has a significant effect on the long-time series of dengue transmission, while socio-ecological factors play an important role in dengue outbreaks. The interactive effect of temperature and socio-ecological factors contributes to dengue outbreak in Guangzhou. Increasing temperature and surge in travel could cause a dengue outbreak in the future. We have made suggestions about policies and measures regarding its prevention in Guangzhou. nan;ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA-CULICIDAE; SPATIOTEMPORAL TRANSMISSION; FEVER TRANSMISSION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; HUMAN MOVEMENT; GUANGDONG; WEATHER; MODEL","Are Valuable and Representative Natural Habitats Sufficiently Protected? Application of Marxan model in the Czech Republic The joint impact of human activities and climate change on natural resources lead to biodiversity loss. Therefore, it is important to select protected areas through systematic conservation planning. The present study assessed how representative natural habitats are protected under the nature conservation network, and to identify new-but so far insufficiently-protected areas containing these habitats for sustainable management. We used the Marxan model to select the most valuable insufficiently protected natural habitats in the Czech Republic as a representative example for a conservation strategy for Central-Eastern European environments. We set three conservation targets (25%, 50%, and 75%), defining how much percent area of valuable representative natural habitats should be added to the area of the habitats already included in the Nature Protection Network. To implement these conservation targets it is necessary to preserve 22,932 ha, 72,429, ha and 124,363 ha respectively of the conservation targets occurring in the insufficiently protected areas, and 17,255 ha, 51,620 ha, and 84,993 ha respectively of the conservation features in the areas without protection status. Marxan was revealed to be an appropriate tool to select the most valuable and insufficiently protected natural habitats for sustainable management. biodiversity; nature habitats; protection level; conservation planning; Marxan model;BIODIVERSITY; AREAS; MANAGEMENT","Forest Management for Climate Change in New England and the Klamath Ecoregions: Motivations, Practices, and Barriers Understanding perceptions and attitudes of forest managers toward climate change and climate adaptive forest management is crucial, as they are expected to implement changes to forest resource management. We assessed the perceptions of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices through a survey of forest managers working in private firms and public agencies in New England and the Klamath ecoregion (northern California and southwestern Oregon). We analyzed the motivations, actions, and potential barriers to action of forest managers toward climate adaptive forest management practices. Results suggest that managing for natural regeneration is the most common climate adaptive forest management approach considered by forest managers in both regions. Lack of information about the best strategies for reducing climate change risks, lack of education and awareness among the clients, and perceived client costs were forest managers' primary barriers to climate adaptive management. Our findings suggest useful insights toward the policy and program design in climate adaptive forest management for both areas. climate adaptive forest management; forest managers; perceptions; outreach and extension; climate change;CHANGE ADAPTATION; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; MITIGATION; PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; RESILIENCE; STRATEGIES; FUTURE; CARBON","Impact of neighborhood spatial characteristics on the microclimate in a hot arid climate-A field based study Although neighborhood is the level where most local plans are realized, little research has been done to understand how neighborhood spatial characteristics can shape its microclimate. This study aims to understand the effect of neighborhood form on its microclimate in a hot arid city, in Egypt. Two neighborhoods with different layouts are selected- a low-density historic area and a modern high-density area. Each neighborhood form was analyzed according to seven spatial characteristics: aspect ratio, street orientation, street trees, green spaces, percentage of tree canopy and impervious surfaces at 20m radii, and sky view factor. Microclimate data was collected using mobile field measurements in summer and winter. In total air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed at 44 sites were measured. The statistical and spatial analysis reveal inter-neighborhood microclimate variation which is more observed in winter than in summer. Moreover, the local-specific spatial characteristics within each neighborhood have resulted in a variation in the microclimate across the neighborhoods. The study also found a seasonal effect on the overall microclimate and on the way local-specific characteristics influence the microclimate. Findings of this research can have implications for future (re)development and planning of climate resilient neighborhoods, in a hot arid context.

Populations were categorized by their translocation histories: first-order populations were those established directly from large source populations, second-order populations were established using individuals from first-order populations, and populations with mixed translocation histories were those established or supplemented with sheep from more than 1 sample on a source population. Nuclear and mitochondrial datasets yielded complementary signals of declining genetic diversity (mixed>first order>second order) that differed predictably in magnitude. Our suite of microsatellites revealed that populations with mixed translocation histories had greater allelic richness (A(R)) and expected heterozygosity (H-E) than second-order populations, but we found no statistical differences between mixed:first order or first:second order population pairs. Mitochondrial diversity, however, was limited to populations with mixed translocation histories. Similarly, we detected significant differentiation (F-ST) among most populations using data from microsatellites, but found major differentiation in mitochondrial diversity. All first-order and second-order populations shared a single haplotype, whereas mixed populations contained 6 haplotypes. Finally, estimates of effective population size (N-e) derived from our microsatellite data were uniformly low (range 9-27), indicating that the maintenance of genetic diversity in the reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep in our study likely will require management action; possibly including future translocations and improvements in natural connectivity among populations. ","The economics of exploiting gas hydrates We investigate the optimal exploitation of methane hydrates, a recent discovery of methane resources under the sea floor, mainly located along the continental margins. Combustion of methane (releasing CO2) and leakage through blow-outs (releasing CH4) contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases. A second externality arises since removing solid gas hydrates from the sea bottom destabilizes continental margins and thus increases the risk of marine earthquakes. We show that in such a model three regimes can occur: i) resource exploitation will be stopped in finite time, and some of the resource will stay in situ, ii) the resource will be used up completely in finite time, and iii) the resource will be exhausted in infinite time. We also show how to internalize the externalities by policy instruments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ","Study on the Classification of Urban Waterlogging Rainstorms and Rainfall Thresholds in Cities Lacking Actual Data Extreme rainfall is the main influencing factor of urban waterlogging. Different types of rainfall often have different characteristics of waterlogging. In order to establish a more accurate urban flood control system, it is necessary to classify waterlogging rainstorms and divide their thresholds. This study proposes a method for applying web crawlers to identify waterlogging rainfall in cities lacking waterlogging observation data and classifying them using the rainfall intensity-duration curves. By selecting appropriate duration thresholds and return period, waterlogging rainstorms are divided into rainfall intensity waterlogging (IW), rainfall amount of waterlogging (AW), combined waterlogging (CW) and no waterlogging (NW). In the application of Zhengzhou City, China, the urban flood control standard and the rainfall time distribution characteristics are used as the basis for the selection of the return period and duration thresholds, and the storm water management model (SWMM) is constructed to simulate the 4 kinds of rainfall characteristics of waterlogging, which is similar to actual situations. It proves that the method is suitable for the classification and thresholds division of different waterlogging rainfall in cities. The results show that the best duration thresholds in Zhengzhou are 20 min (M-20) and 60 min (M-60), and the best return period standard is 2 a. The thresholds for the 4 types of waterlogging rainstorm are: M-20 >= 26.47 mm, M-60 >= 43.80 mm, CW; M-20 >= 26.47 mm, M-60 < 43.80 mm, IW; M-20 < 26.47 mm, M-60 >= 43.80 mm, AW; M-20 < 26.47 mm and M-60 < 43.80 mm, No waterlogging. urban waterlogging; rainfall thresholds; ID curves; SWMM; classification;CLIMATE-CHANGE; IDF CURVES; THO CITY; IMPACT; FLOODS; URBANIZATION; SIMULATION; RUNOFF; SYSTEM; ERROR","Emissions in agricultural-based developing economies: A case of Nigeria Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) contribute substantially to global warming. This article explores and develops roadmaps towards mitigating these emissions in developing economies. Nonetheless, mitigating the impacts of global warming on humanity entails curtailing the greenhouse emissions which is very challenging given that this Greenhouse Gas (GHG) is emitted during agricultural food production processes. The Kaya and Index Decomposition Analysis (Kaya-IDA) models are used to decompose and study the drivers of the agricultural Greenhouse Gas emission (methane and nitrous oxide) in Nigeria from 1990 to 2019. Moreover, different policies are developed using scenario-based analysis from 2020 to 2050 to show possible Greenhouse Gas emission mitigation pathways. The results show that the agricultural greenhouse emission intensity and per capita output are the leading drivers of the total agricultural level of emission in Nigeria. There is also a decline in agricultural value-added contribution in the past decade to the overall emission level. Among the four policy scenarios, the Special Package Policy, which achieves a more than a proportional reduction in agricultural greenhouse emission intensity relative to other driving factors, results in a favourable and substantially reduced level of overall emission in the agricultural sector of Nigeria. The implications of this study also apply to other African economies with similar agricultural sectors like that of Nigeria. nan;Agriculture; GHG Emission; Index decomposition; Nigeria; Scenario analysis; Simulation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Agricultural greenhouse; Developing economies; Emissions intensity; Greenhouse emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Index decomposition; Nigeria; Nitrous oxide; Scenarios analysis; Simulation; Agriculture","Behavioural adaptation of skiers to climatic variability and change in Ontario, Canada Increasing research highlights the vulnerability of the alpine ski sector to climatic variability and change. The literature has focused predominantly on supply-side vulnerability, with limited insight into tourists' behavioural response to marginal snow conditions and ski resort closures. Using an in-situ survey (n=2448), this study examines how skiers in Ontario (Canada) would change their participation patterns if their preferred ski resort were closed due to a lack of snow. The survey focuses on current behavioural responses, rather than decisions based on future scenarios of climate change. Results show that substitution behaviours (i.e., spatial, temporal, activity) differ pending whether the resort is closed for the day, closed until mid-season or closed permanently, with differences (p < 0.05) recorded based on skier market segments. The results also indicate that beginner and infrequent skiers, as well as parents with children enroled in ski lessons, are more likely to either ski less and/or stop skiing altogether, while experienced and core skiers are more likely to engage in spatial substitution. Season pass holders and those at large resorts were also more likely to engage in spatial substitution. Managerial implications as a result of a likely shift in ski demand patterns in Ontario are discussed, with future research needs identified to appraise the differential community-level consequences and future climate adaptation strategies of ski tourism. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS The behavioural response of skiers to changing climatic conditions will be a decisive factor in the vulnerability and sustainability of ski tourism. Fundamental to assessing the contemporary climate risk of the multi-billion dollar ski industry, as well as to estimate how future climate change could alter demand patterns in regional ski tourism marketplaces, is to understand skiers' behavioural adaptation to inter annual climate variability. As skiers engage in behavioural substitution (temporal, spatial, activity), a shift in ski demand patterus is likely. Skiers will concentrate at resorts that remain climatically operable, which will have important management implications with respect to individual resort capacity, visitor experience (e.g., crowding), and consequent impacts on surrounding ski area businesses and communities. Climatically advantaged ski areas and communities will need to prepare for development pressures, including investments in ski terrain expansion and infrastructure to increase snowmaking capacity (including water access and storage), as well as ease increased crowding on trails, in parking lots, inside chalets and lift lines. The results from this study offer decision support to ski resort operators and local tourism officials concerned about how their visitors will respond to changing climatic conditions and the implications for local economic development and real-estate.

Yet in Scotland, insurance penetration rates in the population are low for those in the lower deciles of gross weekly income, and for those living in rented accommodation. The subsidised affordable policies available under Flood Re are not available to this fraction of the population, as they do not insure now and therefore are not eligible. The rented segment of the housing market is expanding, leaving an increasingly large number of people likely not to insure against flood damage although many will hopefully have damage to the structure of their houses covered by landlords? insurance policies. The vulnerability to flooding of Scottish households with low incomes in rented accommodation is a most unsatisfactory situation, particularly as climate change appears to have greatest impact in increasing flood severity in such deprived and disadvantaged neighbourhoods.

The African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, native to southern Africa, has established numerous invasive populations on multiple continents making it a pertinent model organism to study environmental niche dynamics. In this study, we assess whether the realized niches of the invasive populations in Europe, South, and North America represent subsets of the species' realized niche in its native distributional range or if niche shifts are traceable. If shifts are traceable, we ask whether the realized niches of invasive populations still contain signatures of the niche of source populations what could indicate local adaptations. Univariate comparisons among bioclimatic conditions at native and invaded ranges revealed the invasive populations to be nested within the variable range of the native population. However, at the same time, invasive populations are well differentiated in multidimensional niche space as quantified via n-dimensional hypervolumes. The most deviant invasive population are those from Europe. Our results suggest varying degrees of realized niche shifts, which are mainly driven by temperature related variables. The crosswise projection of the hypervolumes that were trained in invaded ranges revealed the south-western Cape region as likely area of origin for all invasive populations, which is largely congruent with DNA sequence data and suggests a gradual exploration of novel climate space in invasive populations. fundamental niche; invasive potential; invasive species; n-dimensional hypervolume; niche evolution; niche shift;SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; AQUATIC FROG; CONSERVATISM; SHIFT; EVOLUTION; RANGE; TEMPERATURE; ADAPTATION; INVASIONS","Impact of Uncertainty Parameter Distribution on Robust Decision Making Outcomes for Climate Change Adaptation under Deep Uncertainty Deep uncertainty in future climatic and economic conditions complicates developing infrastructure designed to last several generations, such as water reservoirs. In response, analysts have developed multiple robust decision frameworks to help identify investments and policies that can withstand a wide range of future states. Although these frameworks are adept at supporting decisions where uncertainty cannot be represented probabilistically, analysts necessarily choose probabilistic bounds and distributions for uncertain variables to support exploratory modeling. The implications of these assumptions on the analytical outcomes of robust decision frameworks are rarely evaluated, and little guidance exists in terms of how to select uncertain variable distributions. Here, we evaluate the impact of these choices by following the robust decision-making procedure, using four different assumptions about the probabilistic distribution of exogenous uncertainties in future climatic and economic states. We take a water reservoir system in Ethiopia as our case study, and sample climatic parameters from uniform, normal, extended uniform, and extended normal distributions; we similarly sample two economic parameters. We compute regret and satisficing robustness decision criteria for two performance measures, agricultural water demand coverage and net present value, and perform scenario discovery on the most robust reservoir alternative. We find lower robustness scores resulting from extended parameter distributions and demonstrate that parameter distributions can impact vulnerabilities identified through scenario discovery. Our results suggest that exploratory modeling within robust decision frameworks should sample from extended, uniform parameters distributions.

The rain-fed agriculture system is vulnerable to climate change impact. However, such impact may also vary by aggregate and sub-sectoral levels of agricultural production. The impact of climate change and variability on agricultural production would engender appropriate policies and practices towards a sustainable agricultural production system. We investigated the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on agricultural production in Nigeria, and drew lessons for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) in Nigeria. Using time series data that spanned 43 years and econometric analytical technique, we quantified the differential impacts of rainfall and irrigation on aggregate production and sub-sectors (all crops, staples, livestock, fisheries and forestry). Irrigation had positive and significant impact on aggregate agricultural production as well as all sub-sectors of agriculture. These findings suggest the need for the minimization of the impact of climate-induced production risks through CSA which would involve complementary development of more arable land areas under irrigation in Nigeria. Irrigation would also enhance complementary agricultural water management for the development of all the sub-sectors of agriculture, thereby enhancing food security and sustainable agricultural production under prevailing climate change and variability.

Our content analysis of countries' climate activities in 164 nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement reveals that these are closely connected to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda). This article explores the connections between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda at a global level, across all NDCs, and also analyses detailed connections at SDG target level for a subset of six developing countries. At the national level, focusing on developing countries that have not yet drafted a National Sustainable Development Strategy (NSDS) and taking account of both overlaps and gaps, the article suggests ways to promote thematic coherence between both agendas and make use of this unique window of opportunity to draft NSDSs and update NDCs, making them more ambitious. Key policy insights: NDCs propose many activities that also contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Underlining the connection between NDCs and SDGs can strengthen buy-in among various stakeholder groups in society for more ambitious NDCs. At the target level, energy efficiency (SDG 7), sustainable forest management (SDG 15), sustainable agriculture (SDG 2), sustainable transport systems (SDG 11) and water-use efficiency (SDG 6) are priority areas for thematic coherence between the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda. An assessment of thematic policy coherence between the voluntary domestic contributions regarding the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda should be integrated in national policy cycles for sustainable and climate policy-making to identify overlaps, gaps, mutual benefits and trade-offs in national policies. The periodic updates of NDCs and the drafting of National Sustainable Development Strategies (NSDSs) should be used by countries to align their domestic contributions in order to implement the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda coherently. Our 'three-step linkage framework' offers a method for this.

The study uses responses from 110 students to problems in which they were asked to explain differences in prices and also to express and justify opinions on what should be the difference in prices. Very few students expressed an environmental dimension in their understanding of price. A few students suggested that environmental impact influenced price by raising demand for ""Environmentally friendly products"". A few students suggested that, environmentally friendly products. had higher prices because they were more costly to produce. We found no examples of students combining both lines of explanation. However, nearly half of the students believed that prices should reflect environmental effects, and this reasoning was divided between cases where the point was justified by a broad environmental motivation and cases where the point was justified in relation to incentives-to get consumers to act in a more environmentally friendly way. externalities; conceptions of price; conceptions of human and physical environment interactions;CLIMATE-CHANGE; OZONE-LAYER; EDUCATION; EMISSIONS; DEPLETION","The use of new economic decision support tools for adaptation assessment: A review of methods and applications, towards guidance on applicability There is a growing focus on the economics of adaptation as policy moves from theory to practice. However, the techniques commonly used in economic appraisal have limitations in coping with climate change uncertainty. While decision making under uncertainty has gained prominence, economic appraisal of adaptation still uses approaches such as deterministic cost-benefit analysis. Against this background, this paper provides a critical review and assessment of existing economic decision support tools (cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis) an uncertainty framework (iterative risk management) and alternative tools that more fully incorporate uncertainty (real options analysis, robust decision making and portfolio analysis). The paper summarises each method, provides examples, and assesses their strengths and weaknesses for adaptation. The tools are then compared to identify key differences, and to identify when these approaches might be appropriate for specific applications in adaptation decision making. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS; WATER","A Livelihood Resilience Measurement Framework for Dam-Induced Displacement and Resettlement The concepts of resilience and livelihood resilience are growing in prominence with water resource development that aims to measure and build resilience to specific disturbances and shocks. However, practical frameworks to measure livelihood resilience are needed, not just a theoretical framework. In this paper, we introduce the livelihood resilience measurement (LRM) framework, which draws on Hooke's law; use the state vector method to calculate livelihood resilience scores; and test the effectiveness of the method by correlation analysis. We illustrate the framework by using it to measure livelihood resilience in Henan Province, China, and assess the strategies that build livelihood resilience. The advantages and limitations of the framework are explored and discussed by drawing on empirical examples. Besides illustrating how to apply the LRM framework in a practical case, we discuss how to communicate with stakeholders to identify and strengthen the factors that build resilience. In this study, land ownership, housing and property value, and emergency cost are the most significant of these factors. Thus, the LRM framework has the potential to help reservoir-affected families protect their livelihood capital and to help governments improve social welfare. It can thus serve as a tool for monitoring and improving the effectiveness of policies and practices aimed at building livelihood resilience. livelihood strategy; livelihood resilience measurement; reservoir-affected families; sustainability; water resource development;SOCIAL-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; DISASTER RESILIENCE; RURAL LIVELIHOODS; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; COMPLEXITY; MANAGEMENT; STABILITY; DISTRICT; REGION","Additional risk in extreme precipitation in China from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C global warming levels To avoid dangerous climate change impact, the Paris Agreement sets out two ambitious goals: to limit the global warming to be well below 2 degrees C and to pursue effort for the global warming to be below 1.5 degrees C above the pre-industrial level. As climate change risks may be region-dependent, changes in magnitude and probability of extreme precipitation over China are investigated under those two global warming levels based on simulations from the Coupled Model Inter-Comparison Projects Phase 5. The focus is on the added changes due to the additional half a degree warming from 1.5 degrees C to 2 degrees C. Results show that regional average changes in the magnitude do not depend on the return periods with a relative increase around 7% and 11% at the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels, respectively. The additional half a degree global warming adds an additional increase in the magnitude by nearly 4%. The regional average changes in term of occurrence probabilities show dependence on the return periods, with rarer events (longer return periods) having larger increase of risk. For the 100-year historical event, the probability is projected to increase by a factor of 1.6 and 2.4 at the 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C global warming levels, respectively. The projected changes in extreme precipitation are independent of the RCP scenarios. (C) 2017 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

Private sector opportunities for engagement in climate change adaptation are less clear than for mitigation, particularly in developing countries. This article first conceptualizes private sector engagement in adaptation by exploring (1) different roles of the private sector in adaptation in developing countries and (2) the way governments can create an enabling environment to increase private sector engagement. Second, it analyses how 47 least developed countries (LDCs) envisage the role of the private sector in their National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). This article argues that private sector engagement in adaptation is often inevitable and potentially significant. Yet, the results show that it receives little attention in NAPAs. This may have three explanations: (1) an intentional approach of LDCs to avoid a distraction from the necessity to scale up public funding; (2) a lack of awareness of the potential of the private sector; and (3) the NAPA formulation guidelines focus on the public sector in the context of public financing, potentially causing path dependency. Developed countries' historic responsibility for emissions obliges them to upscale public climate finance. At the same time, however, LDCs should further explore private sector engagement in adaptation. adaptation; adaptation finance; least developed countries; NAPA; private sector;nan","Adaptation and mitigation: trade-offs in substance and methods Adaptation to climate change and mitigation of climate change are policy substitutes, as both reduce the impacts of climate change. Adaptation and mitigation should therefore be analysed together, as they indeed are, albeit in a rudimentary way, in cost-benefit analyses of emission abatement. However, adaptation and mitigation are done by different people operating at different spatial and temporal scales. This hampers analysis of the trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. An exception is facilitative adaptation (enhancing adaptive capacity), which, like mitigation, requires long-term policies at macro level. Facilitative adaptation and mitigation not only both reduce impacts, but they also compete for resources. ","Assessment of green economic efficiency in China using analytical hierarchical process (AHP) Global health, as well as worldwide development regimes, was seriously threatened by the COVID-19 pandemic and Delta variant outbreaks. In addition to pledging to adapt to and mitigate climate change, experts, economists, and policymakers expressed their determination to do so. Green growth and sustainable development have become the focus of policymakers and governments. The progress toward green economic efficiency (GEE), which will benefit the economy, society, and environment, continues. In terms of green growth and development, implementing environmental regulations and policies has been one of the most challenging aspects of the process. China, the world's second-largest economy, has begun its journey to GEE. Nonetheless, the green economy faces many challenges. The objective of the study is to use AHP analysis to analyze environmental regulation and GEE in China. Accordingly, the study identified three alternative approaches to achieve GEE by analyzing four criteria and ten sub-criteria in the context of environmental regulations in China. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to rank criteria, sub-criteria, and alternative approaches. According to the model, China's best path to GEE is through resource efficiency and green purchasing strategies.

This study investigated the changes of Koppen climate type over China during 1964 - 2015. On average, the arid climate was located in the north-west, tropical climate, temperate climate, and cold climate were distributed in the east from south to north along the latitude, and polar climate was concentrated on the Tibetan Plateau. Comparing Koppen climate types during 1964 - 1989 and 1990 - 2015, we found that cold climate with dry winter was replaced by a cold steppe climate in Northeast China and North China, warm summer was replaced by cold summer in Northeast China and the Tibetan Plateau, tundra climate was substituted by cold climate in the Tibetan Plateau, and cold climate was replaced by temperate climate in Central China and East China. Our results showed that the arid climate expanded eastward and southward, which may have resulted from a decrease in pre-cipitation. Owing to the increase in temperature, the climate zones moved northward. This study provides valuable insights for government decision-makers in formulating crop planting systems, water resource management, and land use planning.

We present the first examination of projected changes in SSRB runoff from a large set of North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program regional climate models (RCMs) plus one Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment RCM. We used six different runoff estimation methods: total surface and subsurface runoff (total runoff), surface runoff, and four estimations based on Budyko functions. Most RCM estimations showed substantial biases and distribution differences when compared to observed data; thus bias correction was necessary. Total runoff was the best of the six variables in modeling observed runoff for each of the four SSRB subbasins. Projected total runoff for 2041-2070 shows a geographic gradient in the SSRB, with possible drying in the southern Oldman River subbasin and possible increased runoff in the northernmost Red Deer River subbasin. A shift to an earlier spring peak in runoff and drier late summer, with a need for increased irrigation, should be expected. In a first examination of the important question of projected changes in interannual variability, we show increasing magnitude.

In this study, a latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique is used to generate parameter sample sets, and a regression-based method is employed for the sensitivity analysis on 16 crop parameters. Then, a top-down concordance coefficient (TDCC) is calculated to assess the stability of parameter sensitivity rankings across diverse RPV. Furthermore, coefficients of variation (CV) and 90% confidence intervals (90CI) of daily model outputs are analyzed by considering uncertainty in observations. We find that the increasing RPV multiplies the CV of daily model outputs, whereas the RPV has no effect on the CV's change rule over time. The 90CI of model outputs include most of the observations when the RPV is more than +/- 30% perturbation. The standardized regression coefficient (SRC) of some parameters are obviously minified when the RPV is +/- 5% or +/- 50% perturbation. The results highlights the importance of RPV selection in the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of crop model, and +/- 30% perturbation was suggested when the RPV cannot be specifically obtained.

Mugo Turra) is an important component of the alpine treeline ecotone and fulfills numerous ecosystem functions. To understand and quantify the impacts of increasing logging activities and climatic changes in the European Alps, accurate information on the occurrence and distribution of mountain pine stands is needed. While Earth observation provides up-to-date information on land cover, space-borne mapping of mountain pines is challenging as different coniferous species are spectrally similar, and small-structured patches may remain undetected due to the sensor's spatial resolution. This study uses multi-temporal optical imagery from PlanetScope (3 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m) and combines them with additional features (e.g., textural statistics (homogeneity, contrast, entropy, spatial mean and spatial variance) from gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), topographic features (elevation, slope and aspect) and canopy height information) to overcome the present challenges in mapping mountain pine stands. Specifically, we assessed the influence of spatial resolution and feature space composition including the GLCM window size for textural features. The study site is covering the Sarntal Alps, Italy, a region known for large stands of mountain pine. Our results show that mountain pines can be accurately mapped (PlanetScope (90.96%) and Sentinel-2 (90.65%)) by combining all features. In general, Sentinel-2 can achieve comparable results to PlanetScope independent of the feature set composition, despite the lower spatial resolution. In particular, the inclusion of textural features improved the accuracy by +8% (PlanetScope) and +3% (Sentinel-2), whereas accuracy improvements of topographic features and canopy height were low. The derived map of mountain pines in the Sarntal Alps supports local forest management to monitor and assess recent and ongoing anthropogenic and climatic changes at the treeline. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of freely available Sentinel-2 data and image-derived textural features to accurately map mountain pines in Alpine environments. mountain pines; PlanetScope; Sentinel-2; gray level co-occurrence matrix;LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; ALPINE TREELINE ECOTONE; PINUS-MUGO; SOUTH TYROL; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; DISCRIMINATION; BIODIVERSITY","Climate adaptation heuristics and the science/policy divide The adaptation science enterprise has expanded rapidly in recent years, presumably in response to growth in demand for knowledge that can facilitate adaptation policy and practice. However, evidence suggests such investments in adaptation science have not necessarily translated into adaptation implementation. One potential constraint on adaptation may be the underlying heuristics that are used as the foundation for both adaptation research and practice. Here, we explore the adaptation academic literature with the objective of identifying adaptation heuristics, assessing the extent to which they have become entrenched within the adaptation discourse, and discussing potential weaknesses in their framing that could undermine adaptation efforts. This investigation is supported by a multi-method analysis that includes both a quantitative content analysis of the adaptation literature that evidences the use of adaptation heuristics and a qualitative analysis of the implications of such heuristics for enhancing or hindering the implementation of adaptation. Results demonstrate that a number of heuristic devices are commonly used in both the peer-reviewed adaptation literature as well as within grey literature designed to inform adaptation practitioners. Furthermore, the apparent lack of critical reflection upon the robustness of these heuristics for diverse contexts may contribute to potential cognitive bias with respect to the framing of adaptation by both researchers and practitioners. We discuss this phenomenon by drawing upon heuristic-analytic theory, which has explanatory utility in understanding both the origins of such heuristics as well as the measures that can be pursued toward the co-generation of more robust approaches to adaptation problem-solving.

The study was based on multistage sampling techniques to select the study villages and sampled households (HHs). Data were collected through HH survey, focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The collected data were analysed by using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit (MNL) model. The results revealed that in response to the effects of climate variability and change, the adaptation strategies deployed by farmers included terracing as soil and water conservation strategy, changing planting date, fertiliser application, crop diversification with improved variety, income diversification and livestock diversification. The result from MNL analysis showed that age, family size, educational level, farm size, income, livestock holding, access to extension, distance to market, access to climate information and agroecological zones were amongst the factors that had a significant influence on farmers' choice of adaptation strategies. The basic barriers to climate change adaptation were lack of finance, shortage of land, inadequate climate information, lack of skill and shortage of labour. Therefore, strengthening interventions that enhance income generating activities and access to climate information should be an integral part of climate change adaptation strategies. Moreover, providing early maturing and high-value crop varieties that are more suited to the local environment is also crucial. adaptation; barriers; climate change; determinants; smallholder farmers;SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS; ADOPTION; IMPACTS; CHOICE","Decision-support tools for dynamic management Spatial management is a valuable strategy to advance regional goals for nature conservation, economic development, and human health. One challenge of spatial management is navigating the prioritization of multiple features. This challenge becomes more pronounced in dynamic management scenarios, in which boundaries are flexible in space and time in response to changing biological, environmental, or socioeconomic conditions. To implement dynamic management, decision-support tools are needed to guide spatial prioritization as feature distributions shift under changing conditions. Marxan is a widely applied decision-support tool designed for static management scenarios, but its utility in dynamic management has not been evaluated. EcoCast is a new decision-support tool developed explicitly for the dynamic management of multiple features, but it lacks some of Marxan's functionality. We used a hindcast analysis to compare the capacity of these 2 tools to prioritize 4 marine species in a dynamic management scenario for fisheries sustainability. We successfully configured Marxan to operate dynamically on a daily time scale to resemble EcoCast. The relationship between EcoCast solutions and the underlying species distributions was more linear and less noisy, whereas Marxan solutions had more contrast between waters that were good and poor to fish. Neither decision-support tool clearly outperformed the other; the appropriateness of each depends on management purpose, resource-manager preference, and technological capacity of tool developers. Article impact statement: Marxan can function as a decision-support tool for dynamic management scenarios in which boundaries are flexible in space and time. climate variability; ecosystem management; fisheries bycatch; Marxan; prioritization; reserve design; species distribution models; captura accesoria por pesquerias; diseno de reservas; manejo de ecosistemas; Marxan; modelos de distribucion de especies; priorizacion; variabilidad climatica; (sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic); Marxan (sic); <SIC>(sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic); (sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic)(sic);MARINE PROTECTED AREA; OCEAN MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION","Peak flow reduction from small catchments using smart inlets A concept for reducing stormwater peak run-off from existing small urban catchments is developed. Stormwater inflow from the ground to the pipeline is managed by smart gullies. The gullies are real-time controlled and therefore capable of predicting the weather conditions. Drainage facilities are usually unable to cope with excessive flows that exceed their design limits. This results in pluvial floods and activation of combined sewer overflows, both of which have negative consequences. Northern Europe is expecting to receive more intense rainstorms in the future; therefore, innovative solutions are needed for flow management. The inlet control presented in our work is financially feasible and efficient to be applied to small catchments with substantial permeable surfaces to reduce the peak run-off. The control system is autonomous; therefore, it is suitable for sites scattered around the urban catchment. The concept was successfully tested in a 12 ha catchment area in Tallinn, Estonia.

Based on the extension of the Cobb-Douglas production function (CDPF), the study uses linear and nonlinear procedures within the scope of new-generation panel data analysis that takes into account the cross-sectional dependence. Regardless of which approaches are used to explain the climate regime, the evidence from this study indicates that climate change has negative and statistically significant effects on economic growth. Therefore, along with the development of climate change adaptation policies, the collaboration under the leadership of the WTE-20 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby prevent the temperature increases should be improved to minimize the negative effects of climate change on growth performances in these countries. ","From environmental to climate justice: climate change and the discourse of environmental justice Environmental justice is a major movement and organizing discourse in the environmental politics arena, and both the movement and the idea have had a large influence on the way that climate justice has been conceptualized. While most discussions of climate justice in the academic literature focus on ideal conceptions and normative arguments of justice theory, or on the pragmatic policy of the more elite environmental nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), a distinct discourse has developed out of the grassroots. In these movement articulations of climate justice, the concerns and principles of environmental justice are clear and consistent. Here, climate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning. This review traces the discourse of environmental justice from its development, through the range of principles and demands of grassroots climate justice movements, to more recent articulations of ideas for just adaptation to climate change.

Heat stress and their associated public health problems are among the most frequent. This paper explores the heat waves impact on surface urban heat island and on the local economy loss during three heat periods in Cluj-Napoca city in the summer of 2015. The heat wave events were identified based on daily maximum temperature, and they were divided into three classes considering the intensity threshold: moderate heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 90th percentile), severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature over the 95th percentile), and extremely severe heat waves (daily maximum temperature exceeding the 98th percentile). The minimum length of an event was of minimum three consecutive days. The surface urban heat island was detected based on land surface temperature derived from Landsat 8 thermal infrared data, while the economic impact was estimated based on data on work force structure and work productivity in Cluj-Napoca derived from the data released by Eurostat, National Bank of Romania, and National Institute of Statistics. The results indicate that the intensity and spatial extension of surface urban heat island could be governed by the magnitude of the heat wave event, but due to the low number of satellite images available, we should consider this information only as preliminary results. Thermal infrared remote sensing has proven to be a very efficient method to study surface urban heat island, due to the fact that the synoptic conditions associated with heat wave events usually favor cloud free image. The resolution of the OLI_TIRS sensor provided good results for a mid-extension city, but the low revisiting time is still a drawback. The potential economic loss was calculated for the working days during heat waves and the estimated loss reached more than 2.5 mil. EUR for each heat wave day at city scale, cumulating more than 38 mil. EUR for the three cases considered. nan;AIR-TEMPERATURE; MODIS IMAGES; SUMMER; AREA; ENVIRONMENT; RETRIEVAL; MORTALITY; BUCHAREST; CLIMATE; EUROPE","Development of an optimal reservoir pumping operation for adaptation to climate change Optimization of operation rule curve of Layang reservoir located in southern part of peninsular Malaysia under climate change uncertainties has been presented in this study. Downscaled climate data were incorporated in a lumped rainfall-runoff model to project daily reservoir inflow, which was then used to determine the reservoir operation rule curves to minimize the operation cost. The results reveal that climatic change will cause a rise of temperature in the range of 1.5-2.9A degrees C, but decrease in rainfall in most of the months in the end of this century which will casue a change in the seasonal pattern of inflow to reservoir. Comparison of historical and model generated operation costs indicates that annual savings of 23% and 33% is possible with optimized reservoir operation rule curves. Assessment of the performance of the optimized operation curve under climate change scenarios shows that it will be able to cope with the changing pattern of reservoir inflow with proper adjustment. It is expected that the method presented in this paper to derive pumping operation curves to optimize the total volume of water to be pumped from various sources to reservoir can be useful for reservoir operators in the context of climate change. climate change; reservoir operation; optimization; lumped rainfall-runoff model;CIRCULATION MODEL OUTPUT; TEMPERATURE","Union means strength: Building city resilience through multistakeholder collaboration A resilience-focused approach requires the collaboration of a variety of stakeholders including the local government, emergency services, citizens, and companies in adapting to disasters. Currently however, governments fail to encourage stakeholders to take part in the resilience-building process. To address this challenge, this study presents a maturity model (MM) that provides local governments with a sequence of stages and policies to improve the collaboration with stakeholders. The MM was developed in close collaboration with six European cities and was put into practice through a case study in a UK city. The MM made it possible to assess the current stage of the city under study and to implement policies for engaging stakeholders in the resilience-building process. Finally, challenges associated with the involvement of stakeholders encountered in the city under study are discussed. ","Understanding the links between urban regeneration and climate-friendly urban development: lessons from two case studies in Japan Urban regeneration policy and projects could facilitate the implementation of spatial policy responses to mitigate climate change and adapt to its consequences in cities. However, the potential role of urban regeneration in creating climate-friendly urban environments is not sufficiently evaluated and understood. Considering this gap, the paper aims to explore the potential linkage between urban regeneration and climate change. The case study analysis focuses on two urban regeneration projects, representing two major approaches of regeneration practices in Japanese cities, namely ""project-based"" and ""plan-based"" approaches. Research findings demonstrate that urban regeneration could help in reorganising existing urban areas in a climate-friendly manner. As a cross-cutting field of urban policy, urban regeneration could also help in creating synergies between mitigation and adaptation goals. Yet, achievement of such outcomes via regeneration projects necessitates the existence of an overriding urban development vision, political commitment, and willingness to implement binding and structural measures. urban regeneration; climate change; mitigation; adaptation; low carbon urbanism; compact city;nan","What Can Machine Learning Teach Us about Australian Climate Risk Disclosures? There seems to be no agreed taxonomy for climate-related risks. The information in firms' climate risk disclosures represents a new resource for identifying the priorities and strategies of Australian companies' management of climate risk. This research surveys 839 companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange for the presence of climate risk disclosures, identifying 201 disclosures on climate risk. The types of climate risks and the risk management strategies were extracted and evaluated using machine learning. The analysis revealed that Australian firms are focused on acute physical climate risks, followed by market and regulatory risks. The predominant management strategy for these risks was to use a risk reduction approach, rather than avoiding or transferring risk. The analysis showed that key Australian industry sectors, such as materials, banking, insurance, and energy are focusing on different mixtures of risk types, but they are all primarily managing risks through risk-reduction strategies. An underlying driver of climate risk disclosure was composed of the financial implications of climate risk, particularly with respect to acute physical risks. The research showed that emission reductions represent a primary consideration for Australian firms in their disclosures identifying how they are responding to climate risk. Further research using machine learning to evaluate climate risk disclosure should focus on analysing entire climate risk reports for key topics and trends over time. climate risk disclosure; climate risk types; risk management; machine learning; supervised classification; unsupervised classification;CARBON DISCLOSURE; MANAGEMENT; CORPORATIONS; INFORMATION; STRATEGIES; FRAMEWORK; EVALUATE","Learning from the tropical cyclones that ravaged Zimbabwe: policy implications for effective disaster preparedness In view of increasing cyclonic activity in the Indian Ocean, nations in southern Africa should prepare well for flood-related disasters. This paper critically examined the level of preparedness of the government of Zimbabwe to cyclonic disasters using the country's three most disastrous cyclones during the past two decades: (a) Cyclone Eline of 2000, (b) Cyclone Dineo of 2017 and (c) Cyclone Idai of 2019. In-depth qualitative interviews, post-disaster lessons learned workshops and a review of disaster policies provided data on five key preparedness measures: (a) prepositioning of resources, (b) early warnings, (c) evacuation, (d) citizen participation and (e) effective response. The findings demonstrate that the government of Zimbabwe remains in the disaster-response-disaster cycle instead of a proactive preventive approach to cyclones. Limited financial and material resources constrain effective preparedness to disasters. These problems stem from a weak legislation governing disaster risk reduction. This study therefore proposes five-policy implications for effective disaster preparedness.

In many developed countries, local governments have been leading local adaptation efforts and innovation. In the local government sector, transnational municipal networks (TMNs) have been particularly instrumental in advancing knowledge and methods for climate change mitigation at the local scale, but less is known about their catalytic potential for local adaptation planning and implementation. This paper reviews recent studies on the role of TMNs and discusses their potential for adaptation in light of experiences with TMN-driven mitigation programs. nan;ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE; MULTILEVEL GOVERNANCE; UNITED-STATES; PARTNERSHIPS; POLICY; CITIES; POLITICS; COOPERATION; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE","Carbon cycling and balance in a traditional cardamom based agroforestry system of Sikkim Himalayas The pattern of carbon cycling dynamics in a 20 year old traditional cardamom agroforestry system located at Sikkim Himalaya was studied for two years to understand the dynamics of different carbon pools and carbon emission patterns in the system. Total biomass (aboveground + belowground) and carbon in trees were 81.91 +/- 9.04 Mg ha(-1)and 38.47 +/- 4.25 Mg C ha(-1), respectively and contributed 27% of the total ecosystem carbon. Herbs and detritus carbon were 2.34 +/- 0.24 Mg C ha(-1)and 3.64 +/- 0.20 Mg C ha(-1)respectively while cumulative soil organic carbon (SOC) stock ranged from 89.90 +/- 2.16 (January) to 117.91 +/- 3.12 Mg C ha(-1)(August) in the 0-45 cm soil layer. Seasonal microbial biomass carbon (MBC) stock varied from 501.34 to 857.77 mu g g(-1)while annual CO(2)emission (SR) ranged from 112.11-219.29 mg CO(2)m(-2) h(-1). SOC, MBC and SR exhibited strong seasonality with a peak value in rainy and least in the winter season. Carbon density of trees exhibited a positive and significant relation with tree density (P < 0.05), basal area (P < 0.01) and aboveground biomass (P < 0.01). All the abiotic variables with the exception of bulk density and soil pH showed strong positive and significant relationship with SOC, MBC and SR.

In modern viticulture, the interface between grapevine and soil is represented by the rootstock, which modulates the uptake of water and nutrients. Thus, selection of new rootstocks for abiotic stress tolerance represents an adaptation strategy for viticulture to the new environmental conditions imposed by climate change. The aim of this work is to evaluate the water-use efficiency (WUE) and the nutritional status of a selection of 30 new rootstock genotypes, originating from several breeding programs. WUE and gas exchange were measured for each genotype in two environments characterized by different water availability, and the levels of N, P, K, Mg, Ca, Na, Fe, Mn, and Zn in the leaf blades were determined during the phenological stages of flowering and ripening. Water availability was different in the two environments, affecting gas exchange, with mean values of carbon assimilation of 10.43 +/- 0.32 and 3.84 +/- 0.34 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), respectively. Genotypes were classified according to their water stress tolerance, vigor, and affinity for macronutrients and micronutrients. A total of 14 genotypes showed tolerance to water stress, and 10 of them reported high vigor and carbon assimilation. Furthermore, the majority of water-stress-tolerant genotypes had greater affinity for Mg than for K. In further studies, the most promising rootstocks will be evaluated in grafting combination with Vitis vinifera. abiotic stress; water stress; mineral nutrition; phenotyping; viticulture;STOMATAL CLOSURE; STRESS; VITIS; THERMOGRAPHY; IRRIGATION; POTASSIUM; SCION; FIELD","The Tourism Climate Change Knowledge System Effective climate change action relies on the production of relevant knowledge. This review provides an interdisciplinary meta-analysis to critically assess tourism and climate change knowledge production across three knowledge domains: academic, practical and political. Building on existing tourism knowledge frameworks and applying systems thinking, the Tourism Climate Change Knowledge System is developed consisting of five knowledge dimensions: Source of knowledge, Knowledge creation, Influence on knowledge, Knowledge content and Knowledge impact. Results reveal how knowledge differs across domains and what barriers impede effective knowledge generation. While some links could be identified, there remains a disconnect between academic knowledge outputs and practical and political knowledge needs. The holistic lens enables the formulation of recommendations to enhance the production and use of knowledge.

Yes, no, maybe The integration of climate policy concerns in other policy areas where decisions are taken that determine greenhouse gas emissions is a prerequisite for effectively mitigating climate change. There are particularly strong interlinkages between energy and climate policy as the major part of greenhouse gas emissions is related to energy supply and use. We compile a set of five output-focused indicators for assessing climate policy integration (political commitment, functional overlap, policy instruments, weighting, and time perspective). We then apply the criteria for an appraisal of climate policy integration in European Union (EU) energy policy during the last decade; that is, we focus on climate policy integration from a horizontal perspective. The focus of our research lies on the comparison of the Renewable Energy and the Energy Efficiency Directives of the Energy Union Package with their predecessors. Our results show that climate change mitigation is a key objective in these documents. The energy policy objectives are generally synergetic with climate policy. The Energy Union Package makes progress in some areas like the more stringent EU targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency or the more stringent sustainability criteria for biofuels. However, some conflicting issues arise. The shift from national to an overall EU renewables target and the change towards more market-oriented support schemes might together with the elimination of preferential grid access for renewable electricity entail negative impacts on renewable investment and on achieving emission reductions. It remains to be seen whether the adaptations in EU energy policy will lead to the required acceleration of the energy transition. climate policy; climate policy integration; energy policy; European Union;ADAPTATION; COHERENCE","Insights into food system exposure, coping capacity and adaptive capacity Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the concepts of exposure, coping capacity and adaptive capacity as a multiple structure of vulnerability in order to distinguish and interpret short-term coping responses and long-term strategic responses to food system vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach - This paper applies an abductive approach for qualitative analysis of data, which were collected through 18 semi-structured interviews among Finnish food system actors. Findings - The findings suggest that coping capacity and adaptive capacity are indeed two different concepts, which both need to be addressed in the examination of food system vulnerability. Public and private food system governance and related decision-making processes seem to focus on building short-term coping capacity rather than strategic adaptive capacity. In fact, conservative and protective policies can be counterproductive in terms of building genuine adaptive capacity in the food system, highlighting institutional and policy failures as limiting adaptive capacity and affecting future vulnerability. Originality/value - This paper is the first to provide evidence on the multiple structure of food system vulnerability. It simultaneously considers the external aspect (vulnerability drivers) and internal factors, including short term coping capacity and more strategic adaptive capacity, as key determinants of vulnerability.

Social learning processes represent a way of managing the inherent uncertainties and interconnectedness of adaptation issues through ongoing learning, iterative reflection, and change of responses over time. Although the theoretical case is emerging for social learning as adaptation, there is limited empirical evidence of how these processes play out as local governments engage in urban adaptation planning. This paper starts to address this gap by examining social learning processes in two cities in India. We show how the social learning processes interact with complex governance contexts in the two cities and how evidence of outcomes is emerging across individuals, networks, and systems. We go on to argue that there are several areas of social learning that need further theorisation to support its application in the urban context. First, theories of social learning need to allow for unequal power relationships to continue to shape learning processes and take into account structural and historical dynamics as well as relational forms of power. Second, the way that scale is understood needs to be reopened as a point of analysis to understand how scalar concepts are used by actors to frame and locate problems and solutions rather than being understood as fixed and immutable. climate change; governance; India; social learning; urban planning;RESILIENCE; GOVERNANCE; CITIES; INFORMATION; USABILITY; CAPACITY; POWER","Long-term trend analysis in climate variables and agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change in the Senegal River Basin The objectives of this study were to investigate the trend in annual precipitation, sunshine duration, wind speed (u(2)), and annual and monthly minimum temperature (T-min), maximum temperature (T-max), and relative humidity (RH) and the adaptation strategies for the Senegal River Basin. Annual precipitation, Tmin, Tmax, RH, sunshine duration, and u(2) for the period of 1950-2000 recorded at St-Louis, Bakel, Dagana, Fanaye, Podor, and Matam have been analysed using the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator. Annual precipitation varied with location from 900mm registered in 1967 at Bakel to 32 mm obtained at Dagana in 1986. A significant decreasing trend (p<0.001) in precipitation was observed at Podor, Dagana, Matam, Bakel, and St-Louis. A non-significant decreasing trend in annual precipitation was observed at Fanaye Dieri. There was a significant increasing trend (p<0.001) in Tmax and Tmin at all locations. Sunshine duration had a significant decreasing trend at Podor, Matam, and St-Louis at the rate of 0.27, 0.28, and 0.35 h decade(-1), respectively. RH and u(2) have differences in their trends, with the first one showing a strong and significant decrease and u(2) with less significance in their trends.

Responses (N = 224) were collected from pre-service teachers at the University of Eastern Finland. The findings show that pre-service teachers have a very low level of knowledge of the impact of different mitigative climate change actions. Furthermore, the students tend to overestimate the carbon footprint of low-impact actions and underestimate the carbon footprint of high-impact actions and they are unable to make a clear distinction between low- and high-impact actions, though the impact of the high-impact actions may be many times greater than those of low-impact actions. In general, pre-service teachers were willing to take low-impact actions, somewhat willing to take mid-impact actions, but reluctant to take the highest-impact actions. Knowledge of the impact of actions did not correlate with willingness to act, possibly due to low levels of knowledge. Some correlation between confidence in knowledge and willingness to act was found. This article discusses the importance of considering confidence in knowledge in future research examining the relationship between knowledge and action.

Also, 70%-75% of emissions are associated with the electricity generation due to the predominant role of the lignite fuelled power plants. Recently, the government has adopted a strategy for the use of renewable energy sources (RES) which identifies a target of 21% of final energy consumption from RES by 2020. In this paper, analyses are conducted in order to investigate to which extent and in which way the absorption capacity of the power system for RES electricity can be improved. For this purpose, combining various conventional and RES technologies, including pump storage hydro power plant and revitalisation of the existing lignite power plants six scenarios for the power system expansion are developed by making use of EnergyPLAN model. Critical excess of electricity analyses are conducted in order to identify the maximal penetration of wind electricity. The results have shown that in the exiting capacities maximal penetration of wind electricity in 2020 is 13% of total electricity consumption. The revitalization of the existing lignite power plants and building of pump storage power plant would increase the wind penetration. Furthermore, the developed scenarios are comparatively assessed in terms of the associated greenhouse gases emissions and import of electricity.

Hence, such people are very anxious about their personal safety during disasters. The aim of this study was to explain the safety needs of people with disabilities during earthquakes.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted with purposive sampling. A total of 12 people with movement disability, aged between 18 and 60 years, and with an experience of facing earthquakes, participated in semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was used.ResultsThe safety needs of people with disabilities were categorized into three phases: those before an earthquake were considering building codes and resistant construction, building safe and resistant-to-climate-change shelters, and securing the room at the home and workplace; that during an earthquake was the existence of personal protection facilities; and those after an earthquake were adaptation of bathrooms in secure areas, prioritizing conex containers instead of tents, and sheltering in a safe and vermin-free area.ConclusionsThe sudden death of people with disabilities during disasters is preventable through proper planning and preparedness of emergency personnel. Hence, identifying the safety needs of these people and inclusion of such plans in disasters management systems can assure safety for people with disabilities during disasters.

Streamflow seasonal cycles over the basin are characteristic of the northern region, with the lowest runoff in April and peak flow in June. Analyses of monthly flows and trends show that reservoir construction and operation have considerably affected streamflow regimes. Comparisons of mean monthly discharge records between pre- and post-1986 dam periods indicate that the mid-lower basin (downstream of the dam) experienced significant increase in low flows and decrease in peak flows after dam construction. For example, mean monthly flows during the post-dam period at the Ust'-Srednekan station (located 1423 km downstream of the dam) has strongly increased by about 205 m(3) s(-1) (or 522%-3157%) during December-April, and decreased by 133 m(3) s(-1) (41%) in June. Long-term monthly discharge data reveal an overall increase in streamflow during low flow seasons; the increase is greater for the stations located downstream of the dam. The Srednekolunsk station (1720 km from dam) shows low flow increase ranging from 130 (43%) to 268 m(3) s(-1) (454%) during November-April, and high discharge decrease by 2550 to 519 m(3) s(-1) during June-August in the post-dam era (1986-2000). These changes in flow patterns are mainly caused by reservoir regulation, as reservoirs release water in winter for power generation and store water in summer for flood control. Dam impact on flow regimes and changes are visible along the main river trunk; thus, the cold season discharge increase at the basin outlet is primarily the result of reservoir regulation. Annual discharge records show different changes within the Kolyma basin, with moderate increases in the upper basin and weak decreases in the mid-lower basin. Overall annual discharge near the basin outlet has decreased by 1.5% during 1978-2000. This study emphasizes the importance of human activities (particularly reservoirs) on seasonal and regional hydrology changes and points to the need to further examine natural causes and human impacts over other high-latitude watersheds. nan;FRESH-WATER; AIR-TEMPERATURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; ARCTIC-OCEAN; SEA ICE; RIVER; DISCHARGE; WORLD; CIRCULATION; ECOSYSTEMS","Regime shifts and management Regime shifts are substantial reorganizations in system structure, functions and feedbacks, which can lead to changes in the provision of ecosystem services with significant impacts on human well-being. Recent research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global significance. In this paper we discuss management of social-ecological systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts is beneficial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneficial too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being. Linking scientific understanding with decision-making is important but distributional consequences can impede decision making and action. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This study used one of the most advanced crop production potential models, the Global Agro-Ecological Zones model, to calculate the soybean production potential in Western Jilin based on meteorological, topography, soil and land use data, and analyzed the impact of farmland change on soybean production potential during 1975-2013. The main conclusions were the following: first, the total soybean production potential in Western Jilin in 2013 was 8.92 million tonnes, and the average soybean production potential was 1612 kg/ha. The production potential of eastern area was higher than the other areas of Western Jilin. Second, farmland change led to a growth of 3.30 million tonnes in soybean production potential between 1975 and 2000, and a decrease of 1.03 million tonnes between 2000 and 2013. Third, taking account of two situations of farmland change, the conversion between dryland and other categories, and the change of irrigation percentage led to the total soybean production potential in Western Jilin increased by 2.31 and only 0.28 million tonnes respectively between 1975 and 2000, and increased by 0.12 and 0.29 million tonnes respectively between 2000 and 2013. In general, the increase of soybean potential production was mainly due to grassland and woodland reclamation. The results of this study would be a good guideline for protecting safe baseline of farmland, managing land resources, and ensuring continuity and stability of soybean supply and food security. farmland change; soybean; production potential; GAEZ; Western Jilin;CROP PRODUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TEMPERATURE; MODEL","Application of remotely sensed sea surface temperature for assessment of recurrent coral bleaching (2014-2019) impact on a marginal coral ecosystem The 2014-2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a prolonged marine heatwave that led to widespread coral bleaching and mortality across the Indo-pacific coral reefs. Prediction of coral bleaching and assessment of bleaching impact on corals is vital for reef ecosystem functioning, services and management. Wherein, advanced satellite remote sensing approach to determine and quantify the thermal stress on corals can assist as an alternative and convenient tool for reef monitoring programs. The present study examines the impact of consecutive coral bleaching episodes on shallow-water marginalized patch reef ecosystems on the Eastern Arabian Sea. Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch's (NOAA-CRW) platform, known as CoralTemp, were used to analyze the thermal stress on the coral reefs. Coral bleaching indices like Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) were calculated. Ground-truthing revealed that detected thermal stress from satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data over this region well corroborate with the mass coral bleaching events, and found reliable for detecting coral bleaching episodes in the marginalized turbid coral habitats.

They reduce the expenses associated with water treatment, grey infrastructure, and energy consumption and thus generate economic benefits. They also benefit the environment by mitigating air pollution and climate change, and they provide social benefits such as enhancing livability, urban green space, and educating and improving the health of the public. Many studies have attempted to calculate the monetary value of these benefits. However, few have considered all three types of benefits (i.e., economic, environmental, and social) or considered all of the different LID practices at a city-scale. This study develops a life cycle quantification framework to determine the monetary values of the three types of benefits and the life cycle net benefit of LID practices for a city. Applying the proposed framework to a case study of Hong Kong, the 30-year economic and environmental benefits are 5.3 billion USD and 1.2 billion USD, respectively. The mean and median social benefits are 35.1 billion USD and 49.6 billion USD, respectively. Subtracting the 30-year LID implementation cost (55.8 billion USD) produces a median positive net benefit of 2.3 billion USD with an annual unit value of 1.05 USD/m(2) yr, and a mean negative net benefit of 12.2 billion USD with an annual unit value of 5.58 USD/m(2) yr. Sensitivity analyses show that the net benefit is sensitive to the willingness to pay (WTP) of Hong Kong people, especially the WTP of the private sector, and the land cost of green roofs. Overall, this study provides a framework for quantifying and evaluating the life cycle cost, benefits, and net benefit of LID practices. The assumptions in the framework can be modified based on local information and applied to many other cities worldwide. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

This study addressed the climate change-driven long-term concerns of developing an agricultural project in this region where groundwater from the non-renewable Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System (NSAS) is the only source of water. Different climate models were used under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs); RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Projected seasonal temperatures show that the maximum increase in summer is 1.68 +/- 1.64 degrees C in 2060 and 4.65 +/- 1.82 degrees C in 2100 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The increase in water requirement for crops is estimated around 6-8.1% under RCP 4.5 while around 9.7-18.2% under RCP 8.5. Maximum reductions of strategic crop yields vary from 2.9% to 12.8% in 2060 under RCP 4.5, while from 10.4% to 27.4% in 2100 under RCP 8.5. Project goals are feasible until 2100 under RCP 4.5 but only until 2080 with RCP 8.5. When an optimization analysis was conducted, these goals are possible from 2080 to 2100 by modified land allocation. The proposed methodology is useful to project impact of climate change anywhere such that management and adaptation options can be proposed for sustainable agricultural development.

Water plays a central part in many aspects of life, and good hydrological science is needed to inform many decisions that affect human health and livelihoods. Hydrological scientists are aware of the importance of their work, and make great efforts to develop relevant research and advice. Decision-makers want to use the best science in their decisions, but rarely read academic papers or attend conferences. This gap is often filled either by organisations that aim to bridge the science to policy gap (boundary organisations) or hydrological consultants. Academic hydrologists can aid the efficient transfer of knowledge to practitioners in these organisations by writing review papers, participating in professional conferences and engaging practitioners in their work. Researchers should also try to anticipate future evidence requirements and prepare research that will meet these. Faced with hydrological problems, decision-makers should continue to seek the right professional advice, and hydrological scientists should respect the expertise of decision-makers in making decisions. applied hydrology; decision-making; decision support; knowledge exchange; research impact; scientific advice;SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; POLICY; ADAPTATION","Transcriptional regulation of phosphate acquisition by higher plants Phosphorus (P), an essential macronutrient required for plant growth and development, is often limiting in natural and agro-climatic environments. To cope with heterogeneous or low phosphate (Pi) availability, plants have evolved an array of adaptive responses facilitating optimal acquisition and distribution of Pi. The root system plays a pivotal role in Pi-deficiency-mediated adaptive responses that are regulated by a complex interplay of systemic and local Pi sensing. Cross-talk with sugar, phytohormones, and other nutrient signaling pathways further highlight the intricacies involved in maintaining Pi homeostasis. Transcriptional regulation of Pi-starvation responses is particularly intriguing and involves a host of transcription factors (TFs). Although PHR1 of Arabidopsis is an extensively studied MYB TF regulating subset of Pi-starvation responses, it is not induced during Pi deprivation. Genome-wide analyses of Arabidopsis have shown that low Pi stress triggers spatiotemporal expression of several genes encoding different TFs. Functional characterization of some of these TFs reveals their diverse roles in regulating root system architecture, and acquisition and utilization of Pi. Some of the TFs are also involved in phytohormone-mediated root responses to Pi starvation. The biological roles of these TFs in transcriptional regulation of Pi homeostasis in model plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa are presented in this review.

However, the actual costs and benefits of maintaining flexibility remain largely unexplored, and alternative approaches for decision making under uncertainty may lead to better joint outcomes for conservation and other societal goals. For example, keeping options open for coastal ecosystems incurs opportunity costs for developers. We devised a decision framework that integrates these costs and benefits with probabilistic forecasts for the extent of sea-level rise to find a balance between coastal ecosystem protection and moderate coastal development. Here, we suggest that instead of keeping their options open managers should incorporate uncertain sea-level rise predictions into a decision-making framework that evaluates the benefits and costs of conservation and development. In our example, based on plausible scenarios for sea-level rise and assuming a risk-neutral decision maker, we found that substantial development could be accommodated with negligible loss of environmental assets. Characterization of the Pareto efficiency of conservation and development outcomes provides valuable insight into the intensity of trade-offs between development and conservation. However, additional work is required to improve understanding of the consequences of alternative spatial plans and the value judgments and risk preferences of decision makers and stakeholders. Minimizando el Costo de Mantener Opciones Abiertas para la Conservacion en un Clima Cambiante Resumen Los documentos de politica abogan que los administradores deben mantener sus opciones abiertas mientras planean proteger a los ecosistemas costeros de los impactos del cambio climatico. Sin embargo, el beneficio de mantener la flexibilidad permanece en su mayoria sin explorar y los acercamientos alternativos para la toma de decisiones bajo incertidumbre pueden llevar a mejores resultados conjuntos para la conservacion y otras metas sociales. Por ejemplo, mantener las opciones abiertas para los ecosistemas costeros incurre en costos de oportunidad para los desarrolladores. Disenamos un marco de trabajo de decision que integra estos costos con pronosticos de probabilidad para la extension del aumento en el nivel del mar para encontrar un balance entre la proteccion del ecosistema costero y el desarrollo costero moderado. Aqui sugerimos que en lugar de mantener sus opciones abiertas, los administradores deben incorporar predicciones inciertas del aumento en el nivel del mar en el marco de toma de decisiones que evalue los beneficios y los costos de la conservacion y el desarrollo. En nuestro ejemplo, basado en escenarios plausibles del aumento del nivel del mar y suponiendo que participa alguien que toma decisiones neutral al riesgo, encontramos que el desarrollo sustancial puede acomodarse con la perdida despreciable de bienes ambientales. La caracterizacion de la eficiencia de Pareto de la conservacion y los resultados del desarrollo proporcionaron una perspicacia valiosa para la intensidad de los equilibrios entre el desarrollo y la conservacion. Sin embargo, se requiere trabajo adicional para mejorar el entendimiento de las consecuencias de los planes espaciales alternativos y los juicios de valor y las preferencias de riesgo de los tomadores de decisiones y las partes interesadas. coastal squeeze; multiple objectives; spatial planning; uncertainty; compresion del litoral; incertidumbre; objetivos multiples; planeacion espacial;SEA-LEVEL RISE; MANAGEMENT","Household use of and satisfaction with alternative water sources in Victoria Australia Climate change is increasing the variability of rainfall, and thus the availability of water supplies in many areas of the world. These impacts are already being felt in the state of Victoria, Australia where a 12 year drought period was recently experienced. Restrictions to water use have been implemented, as one component of a broad policy approach to manage the drought. While anecdotal evidence suggests that the substitution of centralised water supplies is occurring, this has not been proven empirically. This paper reports results from a survey of households in Victoria regarding their use of alternative water sources. The study found that substitution is occurring. Garden watering is the purpose which has the highest rate of alternative water source use. In total 41.6% of respondents always, and 33.2% sometimes use an alternative water source for garden watering. The most commonly used alternative source of water for garden watering is water previously used in the laundry (30.7%). The alternative source of water used was found to vary depending on the purpose of the water use. High levels of satisfaction were found for all alternative water sources used. Several barriers were found to the use of alternative water sources, the main of which were: inflexibility of existing infrastructure, cost, policy, and housing status. The results have implications for water retailers, policy makers and governments in locations facing water shortage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) seedlings from different provenances using common gardens across an elevational gradient in order to examine the potential for adaptation to extreme environments and constraints to artificial regeneration. Twenty-one provenances from a range of elevations across Arizona and New Mexico were planted in three common gardens: a high-elevation meadow in aspen-mixed conifer forest, a mid-elevation ponderosa pine forest, and a low-elevation pinyon juniper woodland. Two years after planting in 2018, survival was highest at the mid-elevation site (54%), low at the high-elevation site (1.5%), and 0% at the low-elevation site. At the hot and dry low-elevation site, provenances from low-elevations survived longer than provenances from mid- and high-elevations, which suggests greater drought tolerance of low-elevation provenances. Mortality agents changed from abiotic (drought) to biotic (herbivory) with an increase in elevation across sites. High mortality of seedlings planted at high-elevation sites from biotic agents, such as rodents, may challenge efforts to establish ponderosa pine in assisted migration projects. Seedlings had significantly higher growth rate and carbon isotope discrimination ( increment C-13) at the mid-elevation site than the high-elevation site. Provenances differed significantly in diameter, and increment C-13, but not in height growth rate for the first year after planting. Provenance variation in increment C-13 suggests genetic variation in water use efficiency that may be useful for future evaluation of southwestern ponderosa pine seed sources for reforestation. assisted migration; carbon isotope discrimination; climate change; common garden; Pinus ponderosa; provenance; reforestation; survival; tree planting;CLIMATE-CHANGE; ASSISTED MIGRATION; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; GENETIC-VARIATION; ADAPTATION; RESPONSES; TREES","Livelihood diversification in rural Bangladesh: Patterns and determinants in disaster prone riverine islands Livelihood diversification is a key survival tool in resource constrained geographically isolated riverine island (char) areas. Understanding the determinants and livelihood diversification strategy of island dwellers is important for ensuring livelihood resilience in the char areas. This study aims to explore the patterns and determinants of livelihood diversification of households in disaster-prone riverine islands by developing a livelihood assessment index. The study employs Tobit regression model to understand the factors influencing decisions related to livelihood diversification of these households using survey data from 374 char dwellers of Bangladesh. The result reveals that most of the char dwellers have low livelihood diversification scores due to the trap of chronic poverty and seasonal food insecurity. The analysis shows that education, household head gender, farm size, extension contact and organizational participation significantly influence the livelihood diversification decisions of households. It also reveals that resource poor char dwellers are more diversified than resource rich char dwellers. In case of resource poor char dwellers, the livelihood diversification is ensued for survival and influenced by their migration to nearby town for temporary employment. On the other hand, educated persons and resource rich dwellers are mostly dependent on farming or employment in the nearer town or the capital city for better livelihood. A context specific comprehensive development program is needed to create job opportunity in the riverine island areas to improve people's livelihood resilience.

These factors include the interest of individual planning unit members in climate change; Planning Lead familiarity with climate impacts; the influence of trust, leadership, and ""genetic knowledge"" on planning units; and perceptions of strategic gain. The research also identifies aspects of the planning process that may create opportunities for addressing climate impacts in future planning. These aspects include continuation of watershed planning units after plans are developed; commitment to updating watershed plans; recognition of climate impacts in planning documentation; dedicated incentive funding; and the availability of hydrologic modeling tools for assessing hydrologic impacts. Additional types of technical assistance that could support integration of climate impacts are also identified. It is hoped that the insight provided by this analysis will help individuals involved in stakeholder-based watershed planning recognize the various dynamics potentially affecting the inclusion of climate change in watershed planning and in doing so, contribute to the development of planning approaches and tools that will support local efforts to adapt to climate impacts. climate change; watershed planning; Washington State; Pacific Northwest; watershed management;RESOURCES; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; SALMON","The Influence of the Paris Agreement on Climate Litigation: Legal Obligations and Norms (Part I) The Paris Agreement is the first universal climate change agreement requiring all parties to communicate ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets to achieve a long-term global temperature goal. The Paris Agreement is a game-changer at the international level, but has it been at the national (and sub-national) level? What has been the influence of the Paris Agreement on litigation to improve mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change? This question is addressed in two articles. Both articles seek to look at a familiar topic-the Paris Agreement and climate litigation-in new and fresh ways. This first article examines how the Paris Agreement is directly implemented through incorporation into the domestic laws of the signatories as well as indirectly implemented through judicial decision-making in accordance with norms under the Paris Agreement. First, the article examines the international obligations created by the Paris Agreement, noting the flexible nature of the agreement and wide margin of discretion left to parties. Secondly, it explores how the Paris Agreement is incorporated in domestic laws and policies. The potential for litigation based on these international and domestic obligations will be considered. Thirdly, it discusses the courts' application of norms under the Paris Agreement.

There is the need to study the trend and statistics for better planning, preparation and adaptation. In this study, the statistical and temporal variation of climatic indices Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was computed for eighteen (18) stations covering four climatic zones (Sahel, Midland, Guinea Savannah and Coastal) of tropical Nigeria. Precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature from 1980 to 2010 obtained from the archives of the Nigerian Meteorological Services were used to compute both the SPI and SPEI indices at 1-, 3- 6- and 12-month timescales. The temporal variation of drought indices showed that droughts were more prominent at 6- and 12-month timescales. SPI and SPEI were found to be better correlated at longer timescales than short timescales. Predominant small, positive and significant trend across the region suggest an increasing trend due to climate change.

The country's reliance on its natural product, which is potentially under threat, coupled with the potential for changing consumer demand patterns, particularly in long-haul markets, should be concerning for the tourism industry. Yet, the tourism industry has been criticised for its short-term, profit orientation and lack of action regarding climate change [Hall, C.M., & Higham, J. (Eds.) (2005). Tourism, recreation and climate change. Clevedon: Channel View Publications; Jenkins, K., & Nicholls, S. (2010).

Tourism and its interactions with climate change. Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 14(4), 317415]. However, little empirical research has investigated the tourism industry's perspectives regarding climate change, neither the relative importance of climate change vis-a-vis other challenges facing the sector nor the strategies and actions required by the tourism industry to facilitate adaptation and mitigation strategies. It is against this background that a qualitative study was undertaken with expert representatives from both the public and private sectors of Australia's tourism industry to explore the industry's perspectives on current challenges and future directions with regards to climate change. The findings show that while the industry is aware of the importance of climate change, it is not seen as a pressing issue, particularly in light of the global economic crisis, and there has been little action by the industry in response to climate change. Respondents noted that the tourism industry is largely relying on, and waiting for, government intervention and leadership for the sector with regards to climate change. climate change; Australia; impacts; policy; industry view;IMPACTS; VARIABILITY; POLICY","Distinguishing the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on variation of streamflow in the Poyang Lake catchment, China Under the background of global climate change and local anthropogenic stresses, many regions of the world have suffered from frequent droughts and floods in recent decades. Assessing the relative effect of climate change and human activities is essential not only for understanding the mechanism of hydrological response in the catchment, but also for local water resources management as well as floods and droughts protection. The Poyang Lake catchment in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has experienced significant changes in hydro-climatic variables and human activities during the past decades and therefore provides an excellent site for studying the hydrological impact of climate change and human activities. In this study, the characteristics of hydro-climatic changes of the Poyang Lake catchment were analyzed based on the observed data for the period 1960-2007. The relative effect of climate change and human activities was first empirically distinguished by a coupled water and energy budgets analysis, and then the result was further confirmed by a quantitative assessment. A major finding of this study is that the relative effects of climate change and human activities varied among sub-catchments as well as the whole catchment under different decades. For the whole Poyang Lake catchment, the variations of mean annual streamflow in 1970-2007 were primarily affected by climate change with reference to 1960s, while human activities played a complementary role. However, due to the intensified water utilization, the decrease of streamflow in the Fuhe River sub-catchment in 2000s was primarily affected by human activities, rather than climate change. For the catchment average water balance, quantitative assessment revealed that climate change resulted in an increased annual runoff of 75.3-261.7 mm in 1970s-2000s for the Poyang Lake catchment, accounting for 105.0-212.1% of runoff changes relative to 1960s. However, human activities should be responsible for the decreased annual runoff of 5.4-56.3 mm in the other decades, accounting for -5.0% to -112.1% of runoff changes. It is noted that the effects of human activities including soil conservation, water conservancy projects and changes in land cover might accumulate or counteract each other simultaneously, and attempts were not made in this paper to further distinguish them.

This study explored the factors affecting the adoption decisions of climate-smart agricultural practices through a multivariate probit model and then assessed the average effect of these adopted practices on rural households' food diversity and per capita dietary intake by using propensity score matching. For this purpose, a total of 196 rural households from the Punjab province were selected through a multi-stage purposive and random sampling procedure for face to face survey. According to research results, the family type was found positively associated with the adoption of all climate-smart agricultural practices. More than 50% of the total daily per capita calorie and iron consumption of rural households is provided by the cereal crops. The Simpson food diversity index indicates that rural households adopting a higher number of practices consume more diversified food as compared to rural households with a lower number of practices at their farm. Moreover, the difference between the per capita calorie intake of full adopters and multiple adopters is the lowest as compared to the difference between full adopters and partial adopters and the difference between full adopters and single adopters. Thus, adopting more climate-smart agricultural practices increase calorie intake more than adopting fewer practices at the farm. Given a positive association between the level of adoption and food diversity as well as nutritional outcomes, government agencies should create awareness among the rural community about the benefits of adopting more climate-smart agricultural practices through visiting fields and organizing regular training for better nutrition. nan;Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Food diversity; Food nutrition; Food security","A comprehensive analysis on definitions, development, and policies of nearly zero energy buildings in China With the rapid development of urbanization and the improvement of living standards of residents in China, the energy consumption and carbon emissions of the building sector is expected to increase in the near future. Nearly or net zero energy buildings have become a hot topic of research to reduce the fossil energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. As the largest developing country and carbon emitter around the world, China has also made significant efforts on nearly zero energy buildings in recent decades. The central government has approved many demonstration projects on nearly zero energy buildings in different climate zones for more than ten years. This paper summarizes international definitions of zero-energy buildings, analyzes the latest definition and identifies the boundaries of nearly zero energy buildings in China. It provides an overview of the current situation, detailed policies and building codes of nearly zero energy buildings in China. Suggestions were given on the development and promotion of nearly zero energy buildings in China. These findings in this paper will help to guide the government to implement more efficient and effective policies and building codes of nearly zero-energy buildings in order to reduce carbon emissions in the building sector.

Responses to a follow-up survey indicate that the PDD statements that concern TT are reasonably accurate and at least 39% of the related projects are expected to involve it. Technology transfer is very heterogeneous across project types and is more common for larger projects. It also usually involves both knowledge and equipment and differs significantly by host country. Technology transfer has declined over time in China, India, and Brazil, the countries that host most of the CDM projects, but it has remained high for other host countries. A host country's existing capacity specific to the technology, the scope for economic deployment of the technology, and complementary policies to build capacity and promote TT, increase the frequency of TT by CDM projects. The technology used by CDM projects originates mostly from Germany, the US, Japan, Denmark, and China, with multiple suppliers of the technology for all project types.

Quantifying the relative contributions of climate change and human activities on runoff changes is thus important for local water resources management and sustainable water resources utilizations. In this study, the heuristic segmentation method was first adopted to detect the change points of annual runoff at Linjiacun and Huaxian stations which lies in the middle and lower reaches of the basin, respectively. Then, the Budyko hypothesis and SVM-based model were applied to attribute the detected runoff changes to climate change and human activities. Results showed that: (1) two change points were detected for the annual runoff at the Linjiacun station (1971 and 1993), and Huaxian station (1969 and 1993); (2) based on the Budyko hypothesis, the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff changes at Linjiacun and Huaxian stations are 42.2 %, 57.8 % and 30.5 %, 69.8 %, respectively, whilst those based on the SVM-based model are 45.3 %, 54.7 % and 34.7 %, 65.3 %, respectively. The high consistence between the two approaches indicates that human activities are the dominate factor on historical runoff changes in the WRB.

Fully understanding land-use impacts on soil is essential to predicting effects on soils from climate change, and providing a scientific basis for soil management. Here, we measured soil properties, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil inorganic carbon (SIC) and total carbon (TC) from 202 samples from cropland, forestland, and grassland, to a depth of 500 cm on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). We find that grassland and cropland have the highest clay and silt content, and have a significantly higher soil moisture capacity than forestland. Soil moisture in forestland is scarce at depths of 100-300 cm, and does not benefit from rainfall infiltration. At the same time, the soil carbon content and stocks in grassland are not significantly different from forestland. We suggest that in the light of climate change and water shortages on the CLP, grassland is more suitable than forestland or cropland to optimize carbon fixation, and prevent soil erosion. Hence the cultivation of grass should be considered as a strategy for sustainable ecosystem management on the CLP. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The usefulness of food security studies for situation analysis and policy making is directly dependent on what dimensions of food security are assessed. This study conducts a systematic mapping of the levels at which food security studies are conducted, methodologies used, and dimension of food security considered in the academic literature on Pakistan, Bangladesh, and India, and identifies research priorities and gaps. The definition of food security has evolved from its traditional focus on food availability and access, to more inclusive measures of food security such as nutritional value and stability. Most studies focus on estimating food security at individual, household or national level but not combined. South Asian food security challenges demand an integrated approach to bridge the gap between domains and scale of analyses. In addition to national level food security research, policy makers and scholars need to pay equal attention to household and individual's food security. Against this background, we call for more inclusive and targeted research on the various dimensions of food security. To make progress, scholars should collaborate across disciplines and leverage the utility of multidimensional research design to study the various food security dimensions identified in this systematic mapping and possible interactions between them. This approach can be starting point to provide useful insights about food security dynamics for the reflection of vulnerability in methodological implications and policy decisions.

Regarding mud stockpile of Guizhou Aluminum Factory as the research object, this paper studies the physical and mechanical properties of Bayer red mud from wetting process, Bayer red mud from drying process, and sintering red mud through laboratory test and finally analyzes its stability under extreme rainfall condition in this region by the Geo-Studio software. The research results show that the red muds in different processes have big difference in physical and mechanical properties. The strength of sintering red mud is about 4.2 times of that of Bayer red mud from wetting process on average, and the strength of Bayer red mud from drying process is about 1.5 times of that of Bayer red mud from wetting process on average. So, the sintering red mud can be used as the subdam of red mud stockpile, to reduce the risk of collapse and dam break. The stability coefficients of the mixed stocking method under three rainfall conditions are 2.611, 2.597, and 2.631, respectively, all of which are above 1.0. It reveals that the dilatation scheme of using the sintering red mud with good engineering properties to stockpile the Bayer red mud is feasible. It can not only guarantee the safety and stability of red mud stockpiles, but also reduce the risk of red mud dam break and the capital investment of red mud yard. nan;TAILINGS DAM; FAILURE","Effectiveness of an experimental injectable prodrug formulation against Fasciola hepatica of different ages in experimentally infected sheep In this work, we present an evaluation of the fasciolicidal efficacy of a new injectable formulation of fosfatriclaben in comparison with the subcutaneous closantel and oral triclabendazole formulations currently used in veterinary practice as fasciolicides. The study was carried out in vivo on Fasciola hepatica at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of age in experimentally infected sheep. To evaluate the formulation, the percent reduction of the parasite load was measured and the number of fluke eggs. Fosfatriclaben was used at 6 mg/kg/IM (dose equivalent to triclabendazole content), closantel at 5% at 10 mg/kg/SC, and triclabendazole at 10 mg/kg/PO; the control group received no treatment. Fosfatriclaben showed fasciolicidal efficacies of 95.5 %, 100 %, 100 % and 100 %, and triclabendazole showed similar efficacies of 97.4 %, 100 %, 100 % and 100 %, at the different treatment weeks (P > 0.05). Closantel showed limited efficacy against 2-, 4- and 6-week-old flukes but 100 % efficacy in adult flukes. All three evaluated formulations eliminated all 8-week-old F. hepatica trematode eggs. Although fosfatriclaben and triclabendazole showed similar fasciolicidal efficacy, the intramuscular administration of fosfatriclaben has several advantages over the oral administration of triclabendazole, such as ease of administration for veterinary use and a reduced risk of accidents for both the operator and the animals. In addition, the dose used in this injectable formulation is only 60 % of the oral dose, which reduces environmental contamination.

To cope with those, existing, and future marine structures need to be made more resilient and adaptive to evolving climatic conditions. In this paper, developed in partnership with members of the ASCE/COPRI Ports and Harbors sub-committee on sea-level change, we have implemented a systematic approach to risk management developed by the FHWA. The general framework presented by FHWA can be specifically tuned to address the needs and challenges of marine structures. This risk-based approach comprises steps related to risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and mitigation of extreme weather events, with the ultimate goal of designing resilient and adaptive marine structures. This structured and systematic methodology is best suited to adequately deal with the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events on marine structures and operations, and to optimize capital improvement scenarios. nan;nan","The role of geodiversity in delivering ecosystem services and benefits in Scotland The ecosystem services approach is now a key driver for environmental policy and conservation management both in the UK and globally. Within this, geodiversity provides or underpins many essential provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting ecosystem services and so it is not only the inherent value of geodiversity that matters, but also its role in ecosystem functioning. Protecting geodiversity contributes to maintaining the resilience and adaptive capacity of biodiversity and supports critical ecosystem services. In addition, the analysis of palaeoenvironmental archives and geomorphological records provides a key long-term perspective on trends, rates of change and future trajectories in ecosystems and service delivery, an acknowledged gap within the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, as well as informing adaptive management of the effects of climate change, including sea-level rise. Better integration of geodiversity and biodiversity as part of Earth system science is critical for the future-proofing of ecosystems and their services and provides opportunities and challenges for applied geoscience. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE SENSITIVITY; VALUING GEODIVERSITY; QUATERNARY RESEARCH; MANURING PRACTICES; SCOTTISH RIVERS; GREAT-BRITAIN; BIODIVERSITY; FUTURE; CONSERVATION","Breaking the Negative Feedback Loop of Disaster, Conflict, and Fragility: Analyzing Development Aid by Japan and South Korea Disaster risk reduction (DRR) has become an important element of donor policy, because numerous governments have expressed their commitment to helping countries vulnerable to natural hazards by mainstreaming DRR into their development programs. Meanwhile, countries that are considered fragile, as well as conflict-affected states, have faced a high risk of disasters brought on by natural hazards. However, there has been little research that addresses the complex relationship between disasters, conflict, and fragility in the context of development cooperation. Against this backdrop, this study analyzed the determinants of DRR aid allocation from Japan and South Korea-two East Asian countries that have shown a strong commitment to disaster resilience and peacebuilding-to investigate whether they are responsive to countries experiencing the combined risks of disasters and conflicts and/or fragility. Despite the vulnerable countries being in the most need, the study found that both Japan and Korea's aid allocation has not been influenced much by the concurrence of disasters and conflict. Rather, it has been more driven by the level of a country's climate vulnerability than the level of a country's fragility. This suggests that developing countries facing multiple risks and challenges are at a major disadvantage in terms of the responsiveness of donors toward their needs and vulnerability. development cooperation; climate change; disaster risk reduction (DRR); fragile and conflict-affected states (FCSs); generalized method of moments (GMM); official development assistance (ODA);FOREIGN-AID; DETERMINANTS; GROWTH; POLICY; TRADE; FDI","Adaptation by stealth: climate information use in the Great Lakes region across scales While there has been considerable focus on understanding barriers to climate information use associated with the character of climate knowledge, individuals' negative perception of its usability and constraints of decision-contexts, less attention has been paid to understanding how different scales of decision-making influence information use. In this study, we explore how water and resource managers' scales of decision-making and scope of decision responsibilities influence climate information use in two Great Lakes watersheds. We find that despite availability of tailored climate information, actual use of information remains low. Reasons include (a) lack of willingness to place climate on agendas because local managers perceive climate change as politically risky, (b) lack of formal mandate or authority at the city and county scale to translate climate information into on-the-ground action, (c) problems with the information itself, and (d) perceived lack of demand for climate information by those managers who have the mandate and authority to use (or help others use) climate information. Our findings suggest that (1) scientists and information brokers should produce information that meets a range of decision needs and reserve intensive tailoring efforts for decision makers who have willingness and authority to use climate information; (2) without support from higher levels of decision-making (e.g., state), it is unlikely that climate information use will accelerate significantly; and (3) the trend towards characterizing climate specific actions within a broader concept of sustainability practices, or ""adaptation by stealth,"" should be supported as a component of the climate adaptation repertoire. nan;BOUNDARY ORGANIZATIONS; WATER MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; COPRODUCTION; GOVERNANCE; FORECASTS; PERCEPTIONS; USABILITY; POLICY","Indicator system to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of China clean power systems The mitigation of climate change demands a transition to low-carbon power generation systems. To identify effective transition strategies and accelerate the transition process, decision-makers require comprehensive information that can best be obtained through an evaluation of transition trajectories. However, little work has been done to develop comprehensive analysis systems that can evaluate this process. This study presents an indicator system to evaluate power system transitions that include 13 indicators capturing the technical, economic, environmental and policy dimensions. To test its efficacy, the dynamic target framework is applied to the power system transition in China, and comparisons are drawn against global market leaders such as Germany, the USA and Japan. This paper finds that the framework enables a more rigorous comparative analysis of power system transitions between countries than is currently offered by the application of piecemeal indicators. This framework complements contextually rich qualitative case studies. Empirical analysis shows that China's transition trajectory has been convoluted because of its more severe environmental restrictions and policy guidance. Cooperation in the intelligent transition of the global power system can promote China's power system transition. This approach should foster both the mitigation of climate change and adaptation to China's resource constraints.

Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) provides financial compensation to land owners who avoid converting standing forests to other land uses. In this paper, we review the main opportunities and challenges for REDD+ implementation, including expectations for REDD+ to deliver on multiple environmental and societal cobenefits. We also highlight a recent case study, the Norway-Indonesia REDD+ agreement and discuss how it might be a harbinger of outcomes in other forest-rich nations seeking REDD+ funds. Looking forward, we critically examine the fundamental assumptions of REDD+ as a solution for the atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gas emissions and tropical deforestation. We conclude that REDD+ is currently the most promising mechanism driving the conservation of tropical forests. Yet, to emerge as a true game changer, REDD+ must still demonstrate that it can access low transaction cost and high-volume carbon markets or funds, while also providing or complimenting a suite of nonmonetary incentives to encourage a developing nation's transition from forest losing to forest gaining, and align with, not undermine, a globally cohesive attempt to mitigate anthropogenic climate change. carbon payment scheme; biodiversity conservation; climate change; REDD; tropical deforestation;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; LAND-USE; CARBON PAYMENTS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTINCTION; INDONESIA; HOTSPOTS; REGIONS; FINANCE; FUTURE","Adaptation to Climate Change: Does Traditional Ecological Knowledge Hold the Key? The traditional knowledge of indigenous people is often neglected despite its significance in combating climate change. This study uncovers the potential of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) from the perspective of indigenous communities in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and explores how TEK helps them to observe and respond to local climate change. Data were collected through interviews and field work observations and analysed using thematic analysis based on the TEK framework. The results indicated that these communities have observed a significant increase in temperature, with uncertain weather and seasons. Consequently, drought and wildfires have had a substantial impact on their livelihoods. However, they have responded to this by managing their customary land and resources to ensure food and resource security, which provides a respectable example of the sustainable management of terrestrial and inland ecosystems. The social networks and institutions of indigenous communities enable collective action which strengthens the reciprocal relationships that they rely on when calamity strikes. Accordingly, the communities maintain their TEK through cultural festivals and oral traditions passed from one generation to another. TEK is a practical tool that helps indigenous communities adapt to climate risks and promotes socio-ecological resilience, which upholds social empowerment and sustainable resource management. traditional ecological knowledge; traditional knowledge; local knowledge; indigenous knowledge; climate change; climate change adaptation; adaptation; resilience; socio-ecological systems; indigenous people;BIOCULTURAL DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; COASTAL; COMANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; CULTURE","Irrigation efficiency and water withdrawal in US agriculture To meet future food demand and sustainability requirements of society, the agriculture sector faces challenges in both the institutional dimension and the technological dimension. One of the main concerns regarding the current agricultural production pattern is the tremendous amount of water it requires to maintain and boost output. With a changing climate and increasing demand from civil uses, promoting both water allocation efficiency and water application efficiency becomes the focus of policy design. The unintended consequences of water policies, however, have led to extensive debates. This study addresses the key question of whether irrigation efficiency improvement leads to reduced per-area water use. The study assembles a national county-level panel data set on water withdrawal, irrigation technology, and farm operation and demographics. The empirical results show that a higher irrigation efficiency is associated with a lower per-area water application in US crop production. Two alternative efficiency measures are proposed. Depending on how the efficiency is measured, a one standard-deviation efficiency improvement (6-30%) in irrigation can reduce 6-11% of water withdrawal in US crop production. The water saving is about 0.06-0.12 mm/day given a county average irrigation water use of 1.07 mm/day.

The present study employs an indicator-based approach to assess the district-level (132 districts) vulnerability of the IHR, based on a modified risk assessment framework proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5). Based on Moron's I and Local Geary, the study also carries out a geospatial analysis to identify the vulnerability hotspots. The Composite Vulnerability Indices (CVI) developed in this study, based on a set of 14 common indicators, suggest that Assam (in the eastern IHR), and Jammu and Kashmir (in the western IHR) are highly vulnerable states as the majority of their districts fall in the ""highly vulnerable"" cohort. The CVI ranges from 0.75 (for Goalpara in Assam) to 0.35 (for Kolasib in Mizoram). The hotspots are also found to be located in the hazard-prone regions of Jammu and Kashmir and the 'char' belt of the Brahmaputra River basin in Assam. These districts are economically poor with fragile agro-based livelihoods, and limited institutional and infrastructural provisions. The outcome of the study has significant potential to assist targeted policy interventions in the most vulnerable locations and rational allocation of adaptation resources through identification of vulnerability hotspots and the drivers of vulnerability.

These changes are often seen as being negative, although opportunities also exist. Other areas of insurance coverage may also be affected in addition to property damage. The potential for third-party liability claims from climate change is less well understood but has even greater potential to affect the industry. Financial assets held to meet claims and provide a capital buffer may also be affected. Therefore the balance sheet of an insurer may be damaged from all sides. Insurers cannot force policyholders to mitigate CO, emissions, but they can give them a choice and a number of them are already offering such policies. They can also take steps to reduce their own carbon emissions. Insurance is adaptation; there are a surprisingly large number of small to medium companies that do not have catastrophe cover, so increasing insurance penetration of these markets would be an adaptive measure. Insurers will continue to lobby governments for appropriate weather defences to keep areas insurable for as long as possible. Non-traditional forms of insurance are available (such as those based on weather indices with parametric triggers) and it may be possible to continue to offer these for longer than traditional insurance. They do bring basics risk with them, and therefore possibly reputational risk to the industry. Insurers can only pool risk; we cannot insure our way out of this problem, but we can help to spread the impacts where possible. ","Underwater noise and Arctic marine mammals: review and policy recommendations Underwater noise is an important issue globally. Underwater noise can cause auditory masking, behavioural disturbance, hearing damage, and even death for marine animals. While underwater noise levels have been increasing in nonpolar regions, noise levels are thought to be much lower in the Arctic where the presence of sea ice limits anthropogenic activities. However, climate change is causing sea ice to decrease, which is allowing for increased access for noisy anthropogenic activities. Underwater noise may have more severe impacts in the Arctic compared with nonpolar regions due to a combination of lower ambient sound levels and increased sensitivity of Arctic marine animals to underwater noise. Here, we review ambient sound levels in the Arctic, as well as the reactions of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammals to underwater noise. We then relate what is known about underwater noise in the Arctic to policies and management solutions for underwater noise and discuss whether Arctic-specific policies are necessary. acoustic; cetacean; disturbance; marine; pinniped; threshold;WHALES BALAENA-MYSTICETUS; BOWHEAD WHALES; AMBIENT NOISE; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; BELUGA WHALES; SEISMIC EXPLORATION; SEASONAL PATTERNS; ORCINUS-ORCA; SACHS HARBOR; BEAUFORT SEA","Effect of mineral fertilizer on rain water and radiation use efficiencies for maize yield and stover biomass productivity in Ethiopia The impact of increasing rates of typically used mineral fertilizer on Rain water use efficiency (WUE) and Radiation use efficiency (RUE) of maize grain yield and stover biomass productivity was estimated across the Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of Ethiopia using the crop model LINTUL5 embedded into a general modeling framework, SIMPLACE (Scientific Impact Assessment and Modeling Platform for Advanced Crop and Ecosystem Management) with the hypothesis that WUE and RUE would increase with higher application rates of mineral fertilizer and vary for maize grain yield and stover biomass across the AEZs. The simulations were run using a long maturing cycle maize variety (BH660) and a medium maturing cycle maize variety (BH540) with historical weather data (2004-2010).There were strong effects of the application rate of mineral fertilizer on WUE and RUE of maize yield and stover biomass across the AEZs. The highest WUE of 11.5 kg mm(-1) and 9.4 kg mm(-1) in maize grain yield and stover biomass respectively was estimated with the application of 315 kg N ha(-1) + 105 kg P ha(-1) in AEZ 3 having the lowest amount of rainfall during the crop growth period as compared with AEZ 1 and 2.The findings of the current study indicate that WUE in grain and stover production can be increased to by 172% to 363%, and 230% to 352% respectively depending upon the AEZs, based on management intervention in terms of increased fertilizer application rates as compared with the WUE under unfertilized conditions. On the other hand, the highest RUE of 3.0 kg MJ(-1) and 2.1 kg MJ(-1) in maize grain yield and stover biomass respectively was estimated in AEZ 2 with the application of 315 kg N ha(-1) + 105 kg P ha(-1) . RUE in grain yield and stover biomass can be increased to the tune of 177% to 362%, and 216% to 351% respectively depending upon the AEZs with the increased application of N and P compared with the RUE under unfertilized conditions. The economic analysis indicates optimal fertilizer application levels of 225 N + 75P kg ha(-1) for maize production under average national conditions and prices and a slightly lower rate of 180 N + 60P kg ha(-1) in regions where water availability tends to constrain grain yields in addition to the nutrient deficit.

As used here, susceptibility is an estimate of the potential for physical change of an island coast in response to likely changes in climate-ocean boundary conditions. The evaluation is based on an assumption that the intensity of impact due to climate and ocean processes can be typically related to four physical and quantifiable variables: island rock-type (lithology), island shape (circularity), maximum elevation and area. These four physical variables were used to determine a dimensionless index for each of 1779 islands across 26 countries and 8 island types in the Pacific Ocean. Most islands fell in the high (29%), moderate (23%) and low (23%) susceptibility classes, whilst the remainder were split between the extremes of very high (12%) and very low (13%). Eleven countries had islands with all five levels, while eight had islands with mostly high and very high ratings.The index may be used as a tool for rapid appraisal by international and regional agencies as well as national governments for prioritization of adaptation measures to a changing climate, particularly when combined with climatic and oceanic process variables, together with knowledge of population and infrastructure.

Examining the adaptive potential of irrigated area expansion under climate change is therefore critical. Here, we assess the effects of irrigated area expansion on crop yields based on county-level data during 1980-2011 in northern China and estimate climate impacts under irrigated area scenarios in the 2030s. Based on regression analysis, there is a statistically significant effect of irrigated area expansion on reducing negative climate impacts. More irrigated areas indicate less heat and drought impacts. Irrigated area expansion will alleviate yield reduction by 0.7-0.8% in the future but associated yield benefits will still not compensate for greater adverse climate impacts. Yields are estimated to decrease by 4.0-6.5% under future climate conditions when an additional 4.4% of irrigated area is established, and no fundamental yield increase with an even further 10% or 15% expansion of irrigated area is predicted. This finding suggests that expected adverse climate change risks in the 2030s cannot be mitigated by expanding irrigated areas. A combination of this and other adaptation programs is needed to guarantee grain production under more serious drought stresses in the future. irrigated area; drought; climate; adaptation; SPEI;GREEN SUPER RICE; FOOD SECURITY; DROUGHT; WATER; WHEAT; TECHNOLOGY; MAIZE; NEEDS","Vermont Climate Change Indicators Climate change indicators are developed for Vermont in recent decades based on the trends in freeze dates, the length of the growing season, the frozen period of small lakes, and the onset of spring. These trends, which show a consistent pattern of a warming climate in Vermont during the past 50 yr, provide useful information for climate change adaptation planning for the state. The freeze period has become shorter and the growing season for frost-sensitive plants has become longer by about 3.7 (61.1) days decade 21, the date of the last spring freeze has come earlier by 2.3 (60.7) days decade 21, and the first autumn freeze has come later by 1.5 (60.8) days decade 21. The frozen period for small lakes, which depends on mean temperatures over longer periods, has decreased faster by 6.9 (61.5) days decade 21. Lake freeze-up has occurred later by 3.9 (61.1) days decade 21, while ice-out has come earlier by 2.9 (61.0) days decade 21. Lilac first leaf has also been coming earlier by 2.9 (60.8) days decade 21, while lilac first bloom has advanced more slowly, by 1.6 (60.6) days decade 21. The first leaf of Vermont lilacs, an indicator of early spring, is closely correlated with the ice-out of the small reference lake, Stile's Pond, because both are related to temperatures in February-April. In the past 40 yr, the growing season for frost-sensitive plants has increased by 2 weeks, and the growing season for frost-hardy plants may have increased more. nan;COVER; ICE","Future water levels of the Great Lakes under 1.5 degrees C to 3 degrees C warmer climates With the many different interests that are connected to the water levels of the Laurentian Great Lakes, the future of these water levels are of great concern to many people, businesses, and institutions. Projected future lake levels were calculated using data from the North American component of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment. The final lake level results are presented in relation to a 1.5 degrees C, 2.0 degrees C, 2.5 degrees C, and 3.0 degrees C change in global mean temperature. The results show that the range of possible values grows as the climate changes, with more extreme values for the lake levels becoming possible with greater changes in the global mean temperature. This increase in the range on both the high and low end may be a more important consideration than any general increase in the average water level for those living around the lakes Because the most severe impacts on the interests around the lake are usually associated with these extreme high or low levels. A greater understanding that the extremes in water levels observed in the past may be exceeded under a changing climate will help in the planning of future developments and activities within the Great Lakes basin with a forward looking coastal risk assessment and help communites build resilience to future extremes. Crown Copyright ","Data Assimilation Improves Estimates of Climate-Sensitive Seasonal Snow As the Earth warms, the spatial and temporal response of seasonal snow remains uncertain. The global snow science community estimates snow cover and mass with information from land surface models, numerical weather prediction, satellite observations, surface measurements, and combinations thereof. Accurate estimation of snow at the spatial and temporal scales over which snow varies has historically been challenged by the complexity of land cover and terrain and the large global extent of snow-covered regions. Like many Earth science disciplines, snow science is in an era of rapid advances as remote sensing products and models continue to gain granularity and physical fidelity. Despite clear progress, the snow science community continues to face challenges related to the accuracy of seasonal snow estimation. Namely, advances in snow modeling remain limited by uncertainties in modeling parameterization schemes and input forcings, and advances in remote sensing techniques remain limited by temporal, spatial, and technical constraints on the variables that can be observed. Accurate monitoring and modeling of snow improves our ability to assess Earth system conditions, trends, and future projections while serving highly valued global interests in water supply and weather forecasts. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand and improve the errors and uncertainties associated with estimates of snow. A potential method to overcome model and observational shortcomings is data assimilation, which leverages the information content in both observations and models while minimizing their limitations due to uncertainty. This article proposes data assimilation as a way to reduce uncertainties in the characterization of seasonal snow changes and reviews current modeling, remote sensing, and data assimilation techniques applied to the estimation of seasonal snow. Finally, remaining challenges for seasonal snow estimation are discussed.

The resulting scarcity of water, food and livelihoods could lead to increasingly desperate populations that challenge governments, enhancing the risk of intra-and interstate conflict. Defence establishments and some political scientists view climate change as a potential threat to peace. While the medical literature increasingly recognises climate change as a fundamental health risk, the dimension of climate change-associated conflict has so far received little attention, despite its profound health implications. Many analysts link climate change with a heightened risk of conflict via causal pathways which involve diminishing or changing resource availability. Plausible consequences include: increased frequency of civil conflict in developing countries; terrorism, asymmetric warfare, state failure; and major regional conflicts. The medical understanding of these threats is inadequate, given the scale of health implications. The medical and public health communities have often been reluctant to interpret conflict as a health issue. However, at times, medical workers have proven powerful and effective peace advocates, most notably with regard to nuclear disarmament. The public is more motivated to mitigate climate change when it is framed as a health issue. Improved medical understanding of the association between climate change and conflict could strengthen mitigation efforts and increase cooperation to cope with the climate change that is now inevitable. climate change; conflict; public health; Syria; security; Mali; Darfur; future health; IPPNW; military-academic collaboration;nan","Ecological corridors in Costa Rica: An evaluation applying landscape structure, fragmentation-connectivity process, and climate adaptation In recent years, ecological corridors have been proposed on a global scale as a response to the accelerated process of natural ecosystem fragmentation, mainly as a result of human impact. In accordance with this trend, Costa Rica has undergone a process of implementing ecological corridors as to promote ecological connectivity since the 1990s, with the establishment of 44 ecological corridors covering 38% of Costa Rica's territory. Nevertheless, there is no research evaluating these corridors on a national scale that takes into account their functions as conduits, barriers, and habitats. Thus, the objective of this research was to describe the process of biological corridor formation in Costa Rica, and to evaluate the potential effectiveness of corridors by considering aspects of landscape structure and ecological processes related to connectivity and fragmentation. We used the National Program of Ecological Corridors database along with coverage analysis from Landsat images from 2000 and 2015.The composition of the biological corridors was determined at the landscape scale and related to potential to maintain a specific population of wild mammals weighing more than 10 kg. The composition of the ecological corridors was highly variable in terms of total area, proportion of natural habitat, and fragmentation process. Most biological corridors are capable of maintaining viable populations of Pecari tajacu and Tapir bairdii, while none could maintain populations of Panthera onca and Tayassu pecari. Only 50% of the biological corridors had improved in their connectivity. Therefore, public policies, such as master plans focusing on ecosystem restoration must be established. In addition, only two biological corridors incorporate the majority of elevation ranges (Life Zones) present in the country, which reduces the potential of the corridor system as a tool for climate change adaptation. connectivity; Costa Rica; ecological corridor; protected areas;WHITE-LIPPED PECCARIES; TAYASSU-PECARI; BIOLOGICAL CORRIDORS; HOME-RANGE; COLLARED PECCARIES; BAIRDS TAPIR; HABITAT; CONSERVATION; FOREST; SIZE","Assessment of the Anthropogenic Sediment Budget of a Littoral Cell System (Northern Tuscany, Italy) In the present study we describe a straightforward and highly replicable methodology to assess the anthropogenic sediment budget within a coastal system (the Northern Tuscany littoral cell, Italy), specifically selected in a partially natural and partially highly urbanized coastal area, characterized by erosion and accretion processes. The anthropogenic sediment budget has been here calculated as an algebraic sum of sediment inputs, outputs and transfer (m(3)) within a 40 year time interval (1980-2020). Sediment management strongly influences the sediment budget and, even if its evaluation is crucial to assess the efficiency of a coastal management policy, it is often difficult to quantify the anthropogenic contribution to sedimentary processes. Different types of intervention are carried out by a variety of competent authorities over time (Municipalities, Marinas, Port Authorities), and the correct accountability of sediment budget is no longer known, or possible, for the scientific community. In the Northern Tuscany littoral cell, sedimentation is concentrated in a convergent zone and updrift of port structures, which have determined a series of actions, from offshore dumping and disposal into confined facilities (sediment output), to bypassing and redistribution interventions (sediment transfer); conversely, river mouths and coastal areas protected by groins and barriers are subjected to severe erosion and coastline retreat, resulting in many beach nourishments (sediment input). The majority of coastal protection interventions were carried out to redistribute sand from one site to another within the study area (2,949,800 m(3)), while the sediment input (1,011,000 m(3)) almost matched the sediment output (1,254,900 m(3)) in the considered time interval.

Bangladesh is one example where environmental changes have long been amongst the multitude of reasons for migrating, with contemporary climate change suggested as a major impetus towards more migration. This paper examines local expert perceptions of migration as a climate change adaptation strategy for Bangladeshis. Seventeen in-depth interviews were conducted with local experts in Bangladesh and Assam (India) on environmental change and migration to understand the perspectives of those with formal education and expert-related jobs who come from the areas being directly affected by Bangladeshi migration. Findings show that local experts consider that migration is used and will be used for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, but migration is not solely for climate change adaptation, instead interweaving with all other factors influencing migration-related decisions. adaptation; Bangladesh; climate change; climate migration; environmental migration; India; migrants;ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; CHANGE INSIGHTS; OUT-MIGRATION; SEA-LEVEL; VULNERABILITY; REFUGEES; FUTURE; FLOODS; BRAHMAPUTRA; VARIABILITY","Evaluation of performance of Active, Beautiful and Clean (ABC) on stormwater runoff management using MIKE URBAN: a case study in a residential estate in Singapore Singapore has adopted a low impact development equivalent of stormwater management philosophy under a national program called 'Active, Beautiful and Clean' (ABC) employing soft-engineering techniques to manage rainfall runoff in the face of climate change and rapid urbanisation.

Calibration results show an overall good fit between the measured data and simulated results based on three goodness-of-fit stats. The runoff factors computed for scenarios with and without the presence of ABC units show an improvement in the range of 21-72%. This study demonstrates the usefulness of using a calibrated model to evaluate the performance of constructed units using measurements.

Too often the debate focuses solely on streamflow volumes and quantities of runoff. In this paper we present simple calculations to estimate a representative irrigation requirement and the potential exploitable yield in each of the 12 drainage divisions of Australia in order to more fully inform this on-going debate. Environmental, social, cultural and economic considerations are not examined. The results indicate that, despite northern Australia generating approximately 64% of the continent's runoff, only 45% of Australia's potentially exploitable yield is located in that portion of Australia, due to unfavourable streamflow characteristics, storage constraints and large evaporation losses. If exploitable yield and irrigation requirement were the sole factors constraining sustainable irrigation, under a full development scenario, southern Australia could hypothetically support an area of irrigation about 60% greater than that of northern Australia (based on only 36% of the country's runoff). Using 'best estimates' of rainfall and evapotranspiration projected under changes in climate resulting from a moderate emissions scenario, the percentage of Australia's exploitable yield located in northern Australia is estimated to increase from 45% to 47% by the year 2050, which equates to a 2% increase to the percentage of Australia's hypothetical area of irrigation that could be located in northern Australia. These results suggest that efforts towards achieving and developing sustainable irrigation practices in the South will remain most important in achieving Australia's long term irrigation potential. This study also highlights the need for better regional scale information on the potential to regulate streamflow in Australia, under current and future climates.

Climatic warming substantially advanced SOS on the Tibetan Plateau from 1982 to 2011. However, it is unclear why EOS showed little delay despite increasing temperature over this period. Methods We used multiple methods to determine EOS from the satellite-observed normalized-difference vegetation index and investigated the relationships between EOS and its potential drivers on the Tibetan Plateau over 1982-2011. Important findings We found a slight but non-significant delay in regionally averaged EOS of 0.7 day decade(-1) (P = 0.18) and a widespread but weak delaying trend across the Plateau over this period. The inter-annual variations in regionally averaged EOS were driven mainly by pre-season temperature (partial R = 0.62, P < 0.01), and precipitation and insolation showed weak impact on EOS (P > 0.10). Pre-season warming delayed EOS mainly in the eastern half and north-western area of the plateau. In the south-west, EOS was significantly and positively related to SOS, suggesting potentially indirect effects of winter weather conditions on the following autumn's phenology through regulation of spring phenology. EOS was more strongly related with pre-season temperature in colder and wetter areas, reflecting vegetation adaptation to local climate. Interestingly, preseason temperature had weaker delaying effects on EOS for vegetation with a shorter growing season, for which SOS had a stronger control on inter-annual variations in EOS than for vegetation with a longer growing season. This indicates that shorter-season Tibetan Plateau vegetation may have lower plasticity in adjusting the length of its growing season, whenever it begins, and that climate change is more likely to shift the growing season than extend it for that vegetation. climate change; vegetation phenology; temperature; end of growing season; remote sensing; Tibetan Plateau;GREEN-UP DATE; LAND-SURFACE PHENOLOGY; TIME-SERIES DATA; GROWING-SEASON; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE; SPRING PHENOLOGY; LEAF SENESCENCE; TEMPERATURE SENSITIVITY; ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS; HIGH-LATITUDES","The impact of vegetation and soil on runoff regulation in headwater streams on the east Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China Vegetation type is one of many factors that affect watershed hydrology and is an especially important influence on surface hydrological processes. Canopy and ground cover vegetation provide a natural cushion against the impact energy of rainfall in headwater portions of a stream basin, increasing water filtration into the soil and reducing surface runoff, but effects of different vegetation types are not fully understood. We sought to evaluate the capacity of different vegetation communities to regulate surface runoff in an alpine landscape. We collected water samples for stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic analyses from precipitation, throughfall, soils, streams, and rivers and compared their isotopic signatures. Results indicated that different vegetation types had different capacities for water conservation. Forested vegetation types were best able to regulate surface runoff. Land use changes have dramatically affected water conservation in the study area in the past several decades: if forested land cover existed at the levels present in 1986 or 1974, the ability of the watershed to intercept surface runoff would increase by about 7% and 3%, respectively, over its capacity in 2000.

Previous studies have reported the climate effects of global deforestation, vegetation greening and crop cultivation changes. However, the contribution of each type of land state, land transition and land management to LULCC's climate effects remain underexamined. In this study, we estimated global biophysical temperature effects of LULCC using CMIP6 climate models, with special attention on the relative contribution (RC) of 12 land state changes, 113 land transitions and 10 land managements. The results show a large difference in the simulated LULCC's temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL, and the two models even disagree in the sign of LULCC's effects in most of northern hemisphere except for autumn. Based on the weighted mean of two models, we found that historical LULCC has exerted a global warming effect at a rate of 0.0025 degrees C/century, with the largest warming effect in autumn. Spatially, a significant (p < 0.05) cooling effect is found from 60<degrees>N to 40 degrees N, while the warming trend dominates the areas from 40 degrees N to 30 degrees S. Based on regression modelling, historical changes in forested/non-forested secondary land, urban land and cropland have contributed over 70% to LULCC's temperature effect, with land transitions from secondary land to cropland and from cropland to urban land dominating the climate effect at global scale. For land management, the climate effect of irrigation is larger than that of nitrogen fertilizer application. Furthermore, the application of nitrogen fertilizer for C3 plant has larger impacts compared to C4 plants, while similar effects of irrigation are observed for different types of croplands. Besides, the large difference in temperature effect between CESM2 and UKESM1-0-LL may be the difference in the forestland and cropland changes. Our study calls for explicit ex-amination of the climate effect induced by different types of land state-change, land transition and land man-agement for developing targeted land use policies in the future.

This study analyzed the long time-series variations of WUE in the Lower Heihe River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid region in China. The net primary productivity (NPP) was first estimated with the C-fix model, then WUE during 2001-2010 was calculated with the NPP and evapotranspiration (ET) data, and the accumulative WUE was further calculated. The results showed that the annual NPP and WUE in the study area ranged from zero to 448.70 gC/(m(2) a) and from zero to 2.20 gC kg(-1) H2O, respectively, both of which showed an overall increasing trend during 2001-2010. Besides, the spatial pattern of WUE kept overall unchanged during 2001-2010, but with remarkable change in some part of the study area. In addition, the accumulative WUE of the whole study area showed a first sharply decreasing and then gradually increasing trend, but there was still some scope to improve the WUE, and it is necessary to carry out some more specific policies to further improve the water allocation and WUE within the Lower Heihe River Basin. Although with some uncertainties, these results still can provide valuable reference information for improving the water resource management and ecological conservation to guarantee provision of essential ecosystem services in arid and semi-arid regions.

Evidence from Northern Ghana Agricultural intensification has been encouraged through the promotion of various agricultural technologies, but the synergies between different technologies have not been fully explored among various specific crops. Using the multinomial endogenous switching regression model complemented with the multivalued inverse probability regression model, this study determines the impacts of the adoption of combinations of chemical fertiliser, improved rice seeds, and herbicides on household welfare. Data were collected from 900 farm households in Northern Ghana. Our results indicate that the adoption of combinations of agricultural technologies is affected by various socio-economic attributes, resource constraints, institutional factors, and production shocks. We find that adopting multiple technologies improves rice yields, gross rice income, and per capita consumption expenditure. The results point out the crucial synergistic effects of the adoption of agricultural technologies on household welfare. We suggest that policies aimed at strengthening farm household welfare should encourage adopting multiple agricultural technologies in rice-producing farm households to realise the most welfare.

We use preference data and psychometric measures characterizing the public's attitudes toward risk elicited through a stated preference survey and integrate them into alternative econometric valuation models to estimate willingness-to-pay (WTP) to restock and protect the threatened staghorn coral off the SE coast of Florida. The household WTP estimates for the restocking program, marine reserve and combined programs were $179.01, $96.60 and $275.61, respectively. Respondent WTP was strongly dependent on respondents' perception of the anthropogenic risks facing staghorn corals and coral reef ecosystems. Adjusting WTP for risk perception resulted in an average increase of 98% in perceived benefits from unadjusted WTP for the three hypothetical management programs examined. Factors found not to influence WTP include preference elicitation method, use of, and distance to, the resource in question. Coral reef management agencies may want to consider people's attitudes toward risk when designing their public education and engagement programs in support of coral reef restoration.

It also aims to identify a methodological approach that allows the socio-technical perspective to be integrated into management decision-making, alongside the more typical economic appraisal methodology. Design/methodology/approach A case study and novel mixed-methodology approach is used, which applies the diffusion of innovations framework, innovation system (IS) framework and system dynamics modelling (SDM) alongside traditional economic modelling and appraisal techniques. This approach is used to assess the adoption potential of solar photovoltaic (PV) and diesel water pumping systems in the wildlife conservation sector and surrounding rural communities in Kenya. The case study approach tests the merits of the mixed-methodology approach. Findings The life-cycle costs of solar PV water pumping systems are lower in nearly all financing and utilisation scenarios; offer additional social, technical and environmental benefits; and the conditions exist for greater adoption. The use of an integrated diffusion of innovations and IS framework generates significant qualitative data that can support management decision-making. The use of SDM techniques aid conceptualisation of the community economic, water and institutional systems into which water pumps may be diffused and provide a starting point for formal SDM simulation. The results suggest that these techniques capture the socio-technical perspective well and, when used alongside traditional project appraisal approaches, produce more complete information with which to support management decision-making. Originality/value This mixed-methodology approach could be used by practitioners to increase the diffusion and adoption of RETs in more complex contexts in late-industrialising countries. The emergent theory built through the case-study approach should be tested further to assess the merits of applying these techniques to support RET management decision-making in other contexts and more broadly. ","A Systematic Review on Adaptation Practices in Aquaculture towards Climate Change Impacts The impact of climate change is one of the many challenges faced by aquaculture communities nowadays. Only a limited number of articles have attempted to systematically review available literature in this field, which has led to the current study, aiming to develop a systematic review related to the practice of adapting to climate change among aquaculture communities. This systematic review was guided by the PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) in its systematic searching strategy on Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, resulting in the selection of 20 related studies. All selected articles were assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Employing thematic analysis, five main themes resulted, namely Governmental (five subthemes), Community (three subthemes), Facilities (five subthemes), Temperature (two subthemes) and Financial (three subthemes), along with 18 subthemes. Based on the pattern of previous studies, the review presented several recommendations for scholars, agencies, and communities to consider in future. systematic review; aquaculture; entrepreneur; climate change; adaptation practice;ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE; ARTISANAL FISHERIES; RISK-MANAGEMENT; STRATEGIES; FARMERS; PERCEPTIONS","The emergence of an environmental governance network: the case of the Arizona borderlands Across the country, government agencies increasingly collaborate with non-governmental actors on environmental dilemmas to gain access to resources, expertise, and local knowledge; to mitigate conflict; and to share risks in a changing environmental context. Collectively, these often overlapping collaborations form a complex and dynamic governance network (GNet). This paper examines the establishment and growth of an environmental GNet over a period of 15 years in conflict-ridden southeastern Arizona, USA. Using social network analysis, we detect the emergence of several influential organizations acting as political entrepreneurs and observe an overall change in network composition. We describe three phases: (1) a newly emerged network, (2) a network dominated by national non-governmental organizations, and finally (3) a shift toward local non-governmental organization involvement. Using institutional analysis, we explore how conflict over natural resource use, decreasing public and private monies for management, and increasing tensions over border security, leads to the establishment of new collaborations and new network participants. While this research focuses on environmental governance in southeastern Arizona, this methodological approach-and insights into the key role of organizations acting as political entrepreneurs-provides a useful starting place for analyzing networks of collaborative governance in other geographic and political contexts. Organizations' perceptions of risk and trust are keys to understanding the dynamics of collaboration within a GNet.

Assessing historical trends and potential socio-economic impacts is especially difficult in the Arctic given limitations on availability of weather observations and historical impacts. This study utilizes a novel interdisciplinary approach that integrates archival analysis, observational data, and climate model downscaling to synthesize information on historical and projected impacts of extreme weather events in Nome, Alaska. Over 300 impacts (1990-2018) are identified based on analyses of the Nome Nugget newspaper articles and Storm Data entries. Historical impacts centered on transportation, community activities, and utilities. Analysis of observed and ERA5 reanalysis data indicates that impacts are frequently associated with high wind, extreme low temperatures, heavy snowfall events, and winter days above freezing. Downscaled output (2020-2100) from two climate models suggests that there will be changes in the frequency and timing of these extreme weather events. For example, extreme cold temperature is projected to decrease through the 2040s and then rarely occurs afterwards, and extreme wind events show little change before the 2070s. Significantly, our findings also reveal that not all weather-related extremes will change monotonically throughout the twenty-first century, such as extreme snowfall events that will increase through the 2030s before declining in the 2040s. The dynamical nature of projected changes in extreme events has implications for climate adaptation planning.

In species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), incubation temperatures regulate the expression of genes involved in gonadal differentiation and determine whether the gonads develop into ovaries or testes. For most species, natural incubation conditions result in transient exposure to thermal cues for both ovarian and testis development, but how individuals respond to this transient exposure varies and can drive variation in the resulting sex ratios. Here, we argue that variation in the timing to respond to temperature cues, or thermal responsiveness, is a trait needing further study. Recent work in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta) has found that when embryos experience transient exposure to warm conditions (i.e., heatwaves), some embryos show high responsiveness, requiring only short exposures to commit to ovarian development, while others show low responsiveness, developing testes even after more extended exposures to warm conditions. We discuss how maternal estrogens might influence thermal responsiveness for organisms that develop under thermal fluctuations. Examining the interplay of molecular responses to more subtle thermal and endocrine environments may reveal significant insights into the process of sex determination in species with TSD.

The processes (relative sea-level rise, tidal range, and wave height) and state factors (geomorphology, coastal slope, and coastline change rate) have been analyzed to evaluate the vulnerability index of the Ivorian coastal area. This study area was divided into three zones based on geomorphology. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was computed for each zone according to six factors describing its variability. Results indicate that the entire Ivorian coastal zone falls into a moderate-risk category. The relative vulnerability of the different sections depends strongly on the geomorphology and on wave energy factors. This vulnerability increases spatially westward taking account of their CVI values. The CVI will undoubtedly increase with predicted sea-level rise. The result of this study could provide wide coastal information to coastal managers and Ivorian government coastal people and help to protect the coastal ecosystem.

However, a considerable mismatch exists between climate model outputs and the data inputs needed for engineering designs. This paper provides a framework for incorporating climate trends into design standards and applications, including selecting the appropriate climate model source based on the intended application, understanding model performance and uncertainties, addressing differences in temporal and spatial scales, and interpreting results for engineering design. The framework is illustrated through an application to depth-duration-frequency curves, which are commonly used in stormwater design. A change factor method is used to update the curves in a case study of Pittsburgh. Extreme precipitation depth is expected to increase in the future for Pittsburgh for all return periods and durations examined, requiring revised standards and designs. Doubling the return period and using historical, stationary values may enable adequate design for short-duration storms; however, this method is shown to be insufficient to enable protective designs for longer-duration storms. ","Distribution Pattern of Trait-Based Community Assembly for Cyclobalanopsis Glauca in the Guilin Karst Mountainous Areas, China Cyclobalanopsis glauca is one of the most dominant species in the late succession stage of plant communities in the Guilin karst mountainous areas of China. In order to explore its role in community assembly and adaptation strategies, we quantified three continuous traits (LA, SLA and WD) for 52 woody species and documented community composition for 20 plots across different habitat conditions. We performed a trait-gradient analysis to partition species trait values between alpha and beta components within and between communities. Alpha trait components consistently varied more widely than beta components, which suggests that much of the trait variation between species was associated with different functional strategies within a shared environment. The different correlation structures for alpha and beta components reflects community assembly processes at different scales. The alpha components were largely uncorrelated with the exception of SLA and WD, while the beta components showed significant correlations along the environmental gradient. There is a significant positive correlation between LA and SLA and significant negative correlations between both LA and WD as well as between SLA and WD. These results demonstrate that slow-growing species with high resource-use efficiency gradually became the dominant species in the late successional stage for Cyclobalanopsis glauca forest and co-occurring species in the same community employ different trait assemblies. alpha and beta components; community assembly; functional traits; Cyclobalanopsis glauca forest; trait correlation; trait-gradient analysis;WOOD DENSITY; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; WITHIN-COMMUNITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LEAF SIZE; ECOLOGY; SCALE; CONVERGENCE; DIMENSIONS; MECHANISMS","Personal efficacy, the information environment, and attitudes toward global warming and climate change in the United States Despite the growing scientific consensus about the risks of global warming and climate change, the mass media frequently portray the subject as one of great scientific controversy and debate. And yet previous studies of the mass public's subjective assessments of the risks of global warming and climate change have not sufficiently examined public informedness, public confidence in climate scientists, and the role of personal efficacy in affecting global warming outcomes. By examining the results of a survey on an original and representative sample of Americans, we find that these three forces-informedness, confidence in scientists, and personal efficacy-are related in interesting and unexpected ways, and exert significant influence on risk assessments of global warming and climate change. In particular, more informed respondents both feel less personally responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. We also find that confidence in scientists has unexpected effects: respondents with high confidence in scientists feel less responsible for global warming, and also show less concern for global warming. These results have substantial implications for the interaction between scientists and the public in general, and for the public discussion of global warming and climate change in particular. global warming and climate change; information efficacy; risk perceptions;RISK PERCEPTIONS; PUBLIC-OPINION; GENDER; RACE; COMMUNICATION; KNOWLEDGE; BELIEFS; SCIENCE; POLICY; LAY","Climate Change Scenarios and Implications for Marine System Sustainability Strengthening climate change scenario research is a prerequisite for reducing the impact of climate change on the marine system.

Methods: After controlling the long-time and seasonal trend, weather, air pollution and other confounding factors, a semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the exposure-effect relationship between DTR and daily ER admissions among elderly adults with different lag structures from 2009 to 2011 in Beijing. We examined the effects of DTR for stratified groups by age and gender, and conducted the modifying effect of season on DTR to test the possible interaction. Results: Significant associations were found between DTR and four major causes of daily ER admissions among elderly adults in Beijing. A 1 degrees C increase in the 8-day moving average of DTR (lag 07) corresponded to an increase of 2.08% (95% CI: 0.88%-3.29%) in respiratory ER admissions and 2.14% (95% CI: 0.71%-3.59%) in digestive ER admissions. A 1 degrees C increase in the 3-day and 6-day moving average of DTR (lag 02 and lag 05) corresponded to a 0.76% (95% CI: 0.07%-1.46%) increase in cardiovascular ER admissions, and 1.81% (95% CI: 0.21%-3.45%) increase in genitourinary ER admissions, respectively. The people aged 75 years and older were associated more strongly with DTR than the 65-74 age group. The modifying effect of season on DTR was observed and it was various in four causes. Conclusions: This study strengthens the evidence that DTR is an independent risk factor for ER admissions among elderly persons. Some prevention programs that target the elderly and other high risk subgroups for impending large temperature changes may reduce the impact of DTR on people's health. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

From the perspective of socio-economic, agroforestry can potentially improve smallholders' income, increase food security, promote gender equality and stimulate cultural activities in rural areas. Furthermore, agroforestry can enhance ecosystem service through improved soil structure, increased carbon sequestration and higher water retention. Despite having many advantages, the adoption of agroforestry among rural communities, particularly among smallholder farmers in developing countries remains limited. The absence of agroforestry in public policy causes little recognition of this system to tackle the climate crisis as well as to improve rural livelihood. This may be due to, among others, a less comprehensive evidence on impacts that simultaneously touch upon social, economic as well as environmental aspects of agroforestry on the community. This review gives a special emphasis on the current evidence depicting the characteristics of agroforestry adoption, its benefits and potential drawbacks, as well as challenges for the adoption in some developing countries. The outcomes might help related stakeholders to make appropriate decisions to improve rural livelihood. agroforestry; socio-economic; environmental impacts; impact assessment; rural communities; climate mitigation; developing countries;COFFEE AGROFORESTRY; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; SECONDARY FOREST; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FOOD SECURITY; BIODIVERSITY; SYSTEMS; AGRICULTURE; PERFORMANCE; LIVELIHOODS","Increased yield potential of wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain by climate change adaptation In the North China Plain, the grain yield of irrigated wheat-maize cropping system has been steadily increasing in the past decades under a significant warming climate. This paper combined regional and field data with modeling to analyze the changes in the climate in the last 40 years, and to investigate the influence of changes in crop varieties and management options to crop yield. In particular, we examined the impact of a planned adaptation strategy to climate change -""Double-Delay"" technology, i.e., delay both the sowing time of wheat and the harvesting time of maize, on both wheat and maize yield. The results show that improved crop varieties and management options not only compensated some negative impact of reduced crop growth period on crop yield due to the increase in temperature, they have contributed significantly to crop yield increase. The increase in temperature before over-wintering stage enabled late sowing of winter wheat and late harvesting of maize, leading to overall 4-6% increase in total grain yield of the wheat-maize system. Increased use of farming machines and minimum tillage technology also shortened the time for field preparation from harvest time of summer maize to sowing time of winter wheat, which facilitated the later harvest of summer maize. nan;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION; SOYBEAN CULTIVARS; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; AUSTRALIA; REGION; CROPS; APSIM","Life cycle assessment of construction and demolition waste management in a large area of Sao Paulo State, Brazil The study evaluated the environmental performance of the construction and demolition waste (C&DW) management in the area of PCJ Watershed, located in the Sao Paulo State, Brazil, by means of an attributional Life Cycle Assessment. The entire C&DW management under the responsibility of the municipal government was considered. The potential environmental impacts were assessed by using two specific life cycle impact assessment methodologies, CML baseline (v3.03) and Impact 2002+ (v2.12). The results obtained by both methodologies highlighted the importance of the avoided impacts from recovered materials, mainly those related to steel, glass and plastics recycling. In particular, the CML baseline indicated ""Human Toxicity"" as the most important category, mainly due to the avoided impacts from steel recycling and the generated impacts from transportation in all the C&DW management stages. The Impact 2002+ highlighted instead the role of the categories of ""Respiratory Inorganics"" and ""Global Warming"", in accordance with the results related again to steel recycling and transportation but also to landfilling of solid residues. The study considered some alternative scenarios of the mineral fraction management, which quantified the expected advantages of increasing C&DW recycling and improving the quality of recycled aggregates.

Early warning systems have four components: (1) risk knowledge, (2) monitoring and warning, (3) warning dissemi-nation and communication, and (4) response capability. While there is room to improve all four of these components, we argue that the largest gaps in early warning systems fall in the latter two categories: warning dissemination/communication and response capability. We illustrate this by examining the four components of early warning systems for the deadliest and costliest meteo-rological disasters of this century, demonstrating that the lack of EWS protection is not a lack of forecasts or warnings, but rather a lack of adequate communication and lack of response capa-bility. Improving the accuracy of weather forecasts is unlikely to offer major benefits without resolving these gaps in communication and response capability. To protect vulnerable groups around the world, we provide recommendations for investments that would close such gaps, such as improved communication channels, impact forecasts, early action policies and infrastructure. It is our hope that further investment to close these gaps can better deliver on the goal of reducing deaths and damages with EWS.

Previous studies revealed that the water management policy in the country is not sustainable from the perspective of demand and balance. Apparently, the reuse of recycled water will be an alternative resource and can be utilized for some specific purposes to reduce water extraction from the ground. It is expected that treated wastewater will reach 20 million cubic meters (MCM) per year after the completion of the new sewage system for Lefkosa. Today, 20,000 m(3) of wastewater is treated at the Lefkosa Central Treatment Plant up to the secondary treatment level, in which the degree of treatment varies from 60% to 95% owing to the weather conditions in the country during the year. Effluent water reuse in NC was not accepted due to cultural belief. However, water scarcity was experienced in the country during the last decade, forcing the farmers to benefit from the recycled water. There is no regulatory framework available in the country for effluent water reuse. However, preparation studies are almost finalized after discussions among government and European Union (EU) agencies. Cyprus, as an EU country, has an obligation to treat the wastewater up to the secondary level before releasing it in an environmentally friendly nature, following the Directive 91/271/EEC. This paper analyzes the effluent water reuse possibilities as a component of integrated water resource management in Northern Cyprus considering laboratory experiment results. It appears that applying tertiary treatment in Northern Cyprus will allow 20 MCM of water contribution to the water budget and it will help protect the vulnerable environment. Also, since the cost of tertiary treatment will be 0.2 United States dollars (USD)/m(3), it would be reasonable to prefer this process to the desalination of water, which costs of 1 USD/m(3). wastewater reuse (WR); Northern Cyprus (NC); water scarcity; alternative water resource (AWR); EU directive (EUD); integrated water resource planning and management (IWRPM);WASTE-WATER; RECLAMATION; MANAGEMENT; AQUIFER","Assessment of influencing factors on non-point source pollution critical source areas in an agricultural watershed Critical Source Areas (CSAs) are areas that contribute disproportionate high levels of non-point source (NPS) pollution to receiving waters, and their occurrence is the result of the complex interaction between the factors related to the sources and transport processes of NPS pollution. A systematic understanding of how these influencing factors affect CSAs is essential for successful watershed management. In this study, we applied a statistical data mining technique boosted regression tree model to quantify the contribution of eight influencing factors (soil type, slope, elevation, RUSLE LS factor, RUSLE K factor, runoff, fertilizer application rate and land use) on two types of CSAs (TN-CSAs and TP-CSAs), as well as the marginal effects and potential thresholds of influencing factors on the occurrence of CSAs. Results show that land use (37.35%, 25.03%), fertilizer application (36.93%, 57.83%) and soil type (17.59%, 13.70%) have higher importance in determining the occurrence of TN-CSAs and TP-CSAs; and the incidence of TN-CSAs is positively correlated with most factors before the threshold for each influencing factor, after which the marginal effect largely leveled off or dropped slightly; TPCSAs have essentially the same characteristics as TN-CSAs, but TP-CSAs are more likely to occur in areas with an annual runoff of around 244.92 mm. In addition, this study discussed the application of machine learning techniques in predicting CSAs under climate change without physical-based models, as well as a preliminary watershed management planning for NPS pollution control in the study watershed. These results provided important information for nutrient management regulations.

Aichi Target 11 indicates that countries are to conserve at least 10% of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, by 2020. In 2015 Canada affirmed its commitment to the 10% target, and also committed to an interim target to protect 5% of coastal and marine areas by the end of 2017. The interim target was met in October 2017 through a combination of federal and provincial marine protected areas (MPAs) and fisheries area closures that qualify as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs), which are referred to domestically as marine refuges. In 2016 the Government of Canada set out a five-point plan for achieving its marine conservation targets, which includes finishing what was started, protecting large offshore areas, protecting areas under pressure, advancing OECMs and establishing MPAs faster. Key challenges that the Government of Canada faces in meeting its 2020 marine conservation target include balancing socio-economic impacts with the need to conserve biodiversity and sustain ecosystem health and ensuring meaningful engagement with partners and stakeholders in a short period of time. Once Canada has met its 2020 marine conservation target it will continue to advance ongoing marine conservation initiatives, most notably the development of a national conservation network, and seek to ensure effective long-term conservation through the management, monitoring and enforcement of established MPAs and OECMs. Aichi target 11; Canada; marine conservation targets; marine protected area (MPA); marine refuge; other effective area based conservation measures (OECM);PROTECTED AREAS; OCEAN MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIODIVERSITY; RESERVES; COASTAL; IMPACT; SIZE; FISHERIES","US Natural Resources and Climate Change: Concepts and Approaches for Management Adaptation Public lands and waters in the United States traditionally have been managed using frameworks and objectives that were established under an implicit assumption of stable climatic conditions. However, projected climatic changes render this assumption invalid. Here, we summarize general principles for management adaptations that have emerged from a major literature review. These general principles cover many topics including: (1) how to assess climate impacts to ecosystem processes that are key to management goals; (2) using management practices to support ecosystem resilience; (3) converting barriers that may inhibit management responses into opportunities for successful implementation; and (4) promoting flexible decision making that takes into account challenges of scale and thresholds. To date, the literature on management adaptations to climate change has mostly focused on strategies for bolstering the resilience of ecosystems to persist in their current states. Yet in the longer term, it is anticipated that climate change will push certain ecosystems and species beyond their capacity to recover. When managing to support resilience becomes infeasible, adaptation may require more than simply changing management practices-it may require changing management goals and managing transitions to new ecosystem states. After transitions have occurred, management will again support resilience-this time for a new ecosystem state. Thus, successful management of natural resources in the context of climate change will require recognition on the part of managers and decisions makers of the need to cycle between ""managing for resilience"" and ""managing for change."".

The greening of outdoor facilities and buildings reduces the urban heat island effect and improves the micro-climate. If this has a significant effect on the protection against summer overheating and the indoor thermal comfort of highly insulated buildings, is so far unknown. This question is investigated by coupling the thermal-dynamic building simulation software IDA ICE with the micro-climate simulation software ENVI-MET. The investigation was carried out using a typical residential area in Germany. In comparison to conventional buildings and gardens with only lawn, the planting of shrubs and trees in combination with extensive roof greening and moss facades enhances the protection against summer overheating on a hot day by up to 20 %. Through an appropriate plant selection the greening leads to an enhanced biodiversity and a better air quality, which is not possible, using conventional measures for the protection against summer overheating. protection against summer overheating; greening; microclimate; IDA ICE; ENVI-MET; thermal comfort; climate adaptation;IMPACT; ROOFS","Gene-ecological zonation and population genetic structure of Tectona grandis L.f. in India revealed by genome-wide SSR markers Population genomics determines the evolutionary potential of a species by decoding the genetic structure and diversity of populations from diverse eco-geographical gradients. Tectona grandis L.f., being a tropical timber tree species distributed in diverse environmental and geographical conditions, is more responsive to local adaptation. This study investigates the extent of genetic variation of teak natural populations in India using genome-wide SSR markers, thereby identifying the role of isolation by distance and environment in shaping genetic structure. Bottleneck effect along with genetic drift and local adaptation shaped the genetic structure of populations which formed three gene-ecological zones, namely, Kerala, Tamil Nadu-Karnataka, and Karnataka, Central India (Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh). Historical gene flow was greater as compared to recent gene flow indicating habitat loss and fragmentation in framing the present population structure of natural teak populations. Genetic diversity of teak populations in India was guided by joint influence of environmental variables and geographical factors. Decline in the genetic diversity of populations in west-east pattern was perceived. Further, more than one area in the Western Ghats acted as refugia during glacial period. The populations/genotypes with higher private or adaptive alleles could be targeted for sustainable management, conservation, and genetic improvement of teak genetic resources in the country. Niche modelling identified central Indian populations to be more vulnerable to climate change and probable shift in the distribution pattern of the species in the ensuing years.

By contrast, imposing new planning provisions, such as enforced retreat strategies, on legacy or existing private assets that are exposed to erosion and sea-level rise will impact on private property rights. In many cases this will incentivise rights-holders to pursue alternative recourse pathways. It is argued here that the behaviour of the key actors in this legacy assets problem are not well described in the models commonly proposed in the literature, and a new risk-based model framework is proposed that better explains the observed behaviours.

These curves, based on cumulative amount and time distributions, are modelled by a power law, this fact suggesting fractal behaviour. Four parameters characterise these curves. One of them is the exponent of the power law. Another one quantifies the intermittency of the rainfall along the episode. The other two are the coordinates of cumulative amount and time distribution from which the power law fits well the normalised curve. The total rainfall amount of the episode, its length and the coefficient of variation of the 5-min amounts are also considered as complementary parameters. Taking advantage of these seven parameters, patterns of rainfall intensity are determined for every episode. These patterns, together with the statistical distribution of 5-min amounts, maximum intensity and rainfall intermittence, should increase the knowledge on the urban rainfall regime with the aim of improving drainage design. In addition to present results, flood prevention should be complemented with extreme value analyses and quantification of return periods. nan;FABRA OBSERVATORY BARCELONA; STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; EXTREME RAINFALL; TIME; PRECIPITATION; INDEXES; REGIME","Methane emission during municipal wastewater treatment Municipal wastewater treatment plants emit methane. Since methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, the abatement of the emission is necessary to achieve a more sustainable urban water management. This requires thorough knowledge of the amount of methane that is emitted from a plant, but also of the possible sources and sinks of methane on the plant. In this study, the methane emission from a full-scale municipal wastewater facility with sludge digestion was evaluated during one year. At this plant the contribution of methane emissions to the greenhouse gas footprint were slightly higher than the CO2 emissions related to direct and indirect fossil fuel consumption for energy requirements. By setting up mass balances over the different unit processes, it could be established that three quarters of the total methane emission originated from the anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sludge. This amount exceeded the carbon dioxide emission that was avoided by utilizing the biogas. About 80% of the methane entering the activated sludge reactor was biologically oxidized. This knowledge led to the identification of possible measures for the abatement of the methane emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To identify such respondents, Oppenheimer et al. developed the Instructional Manipulation Check (IMC), which has been used as a tool to exclude observations from the analyses. However, this practice has raised concerns regarding its effects on the external validity and the substantive conclusions of studies excluding respondents who fail an IMC. Thus, more research on the differences between respondents who pass versus fail an IMC regarding sociodemographic and attitudinal variables is needed. This study compares respondents who passed versus failed an IMC both for descriptive and causal analyses based on structural equation modeling (SEM) using data from an online survey implemented in Spain in 2019. These data were analyzed by Rubio Juan and Revilla without taking into account the results of the IMC. We find that those who passed the IMC do differ significantly from those who failed for two sociodemographic and five attitudinal variables, out of 18 variables compared. Moreover, in terms of substantive conclusions, differences between those who passed and failed the IMC vary depending on the specific variables under study. ","Grid-based flood insurance rate mapping for detached houses considering flood loss frequency and severity This study suggests a technique for mapping grid-based flood insurance rate for detached houses using flood loss frequency and severity. The number of approved flood insurance policies and insurance claims were used to calculate loss frequency. Loss severity was estimated using flood damage ratio map that was developed by applying the equation calculating damage ratio of detached house according to flood depth to flood inundation map. Analysis results of flood insurance rate for Ulsan City, the percentage of area that flood insurance rate was less than 0.02% was 96.51%, over than 0.02% and less than 0.04% was 0.04%, over than 0.04% and less than 0.06% was 0.75%, over than 0.06% and less than 0.08% was 1.03%, and over than 0.08% was 0.53%. In particular, low lying districts near Dong Stream located in western region of Buk-gu have the highest insurance rate ranging in from 0.06 to 0.08. The low lying area near estuary of Hoeya River, Cheongryang Stream, and upstream of Taehwa River in Ulju-gun have higher insurance rate ranging in from 0.04 to 0.08. Flood insurance rate of most area in Ulsan City was calculated to be less than 0.02, which is less than existing uniform insurance rate executed by Korean government.

Rare species are expected to have a narrower niche width than more widespread species. However, we know little whether rare species are also less able to cope with new climatic conditions. To simulate climate change, we transplanted 35 plant species varying in rarity to five botanical gardens in Switzerland, differing in altitude. For each species we calculated the difference in climate between their natural habitats and the novel climate of the respective botanical garden. We found that species with a small range size had generally lower survival and biomass production than widespread species (57% higher biomass and 10% higher survival in species with a range size of 390 grid cells occupied than in species with two grid cells occupied). Moreover, rare plant species survived less when the amount of precipitation differed more from the one in their natural range, indicating a higher susceptibility to climate change. Widespread species, in contrast, survived equally well under all climates and even increased their biomass under wetter or drier conditions. Our study indicates that rarer species are less able to cope with changes in climate compared to more widespread ones, which might even benefit from these changes. This indicates that already rare and endangered plant species might suffer strongly from future climate change.

In this paper, we compare Robust Decision Making with Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways. We apply both to a hypothetical case inspired by a river reach in the Rhine Delta of the Netherlands, and compare them with respect to the required tooling, the resulting decision relevant insights, and the resulting plans. The results indicate that the two approaches are complementary. Robust Decision-Making offers insights into conditions under which problems occur, and makes trade-offs transparent. The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach emphasizes dynamic adaptation over time, and thus offers a natural way for handling the vulnerabilities identified through Robust Decision-Making. The application also makes clear that the analytical process of Robust Decision-Making is path-dependent and open ended: an analyst has to make many choices, for which Robust Decision-Making offers no direct guidance.

Greenhouse gases produced by agricultural machinery and fertilizers during agricultural production are an important cause of climate change. On the basis of the above facts, researching the connection between agricultural mechanization, climate change, and agricultural carbon emissions is crucial for the development of low-carbon agriculture and for addressing climate change. We used a variety of econometric models and methods to analyze data from China's multiple provinces (cities) covering the years 2000 through 2019, in order to meet the research objectives. Furthermore, we utilized rainfall and sunlight as variables to assess climate change and adopted Granger tests to establish the link between rainfall, sunlight, agricultural mechanization, and carbon emissions in farming. The findings indicate a bidirectional causality relationship between rainfall, sunlight, agricultural mechanization, and carbon emissions in farming. Rainfall and sunlight are Granger causes of agricultural mechanization. Furthermore, agricultural mechanization has favorable effects on carbon emissions of agriculture, and climate change has long-term implications on agricultural mechanization and carbon emissions of agriculture. Finally, this paper investigated the green path suitable for the low-carbon development of Chinese agriculture, arguing that the government should formulate low-carbon agricultural policies by region and actively promote the upgrading of agricultural machinery. climate change; agricultural carbon emission; agricultural mechanization; agricultural production;REGRESSION; ADAPTATION; INFERENCE; IMPACTS; ENERGY","Pathways to urban sustainability How science can contribute to sustainable development in cities Recent years have seen a considerable broadening of the ambitions in urban sustainability policy-making. With its Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 Making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, the 2030 Agenda stresses the critical role of cities in achieving sustainable development. In the context of SDG17 on partnerships, emphasis is also placed on the role of researchers and other scientific actors as change agents in the sustainability transformation. Against this backdrop, this article sheds light on different pathways through which science can contribute to urban sustainability. In particular, we discern four forms of science-policy-society interactions as key vectors: 1. sharing knowledge and providing scientific input to urban sustainability policy-making; 2. implementing transformative research projects; 3. contributing to local capacity building; and 4. self-governing towards sustainability. The pathways of influence are illustrated with empirical examples, and their interlinkages and limitations are discussed. We contend that there are numerous opportunities for actors from the field of sustainability science to engage with political and societal actors to enhance sustainable development at the local level. cities; science-policy interactions; SDG 11; sustainable development; urban sustainability;REAL-WORLD LABORATORIES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CITIZEN SCIENCE; GOVERNANCE; EXPERIENCES; POLICY","Reducing environmental impacts through socioeconomic transitions: critical review and prospects Rapid socioeconomic development has caused numerous environmental impacts. Human production and consumption activities are the underlying drivers of resource uses, environmental emissions, and associated environmental impacts (e.g., ecosystem quality and human health). Reducing environmental impacts requires an understanding of the complex interactions between socioeconomic system and environmental system. Existing studies have explored the relationships among human society, economic system, and environmental system. However, it is unclear about the research progress in the effects of socioeconomic activities on environmental impacts and the potential directions of future research. This critical review finds that existing studies have identified critical regions, sectors, and transmission pathways for resource uses, environmental emissions, and environmental impacts from supply chain perspectives. Moreover, scholars have characterized the impacts of socioeconomic transitions on resource uses and environmental emissions. However, existing studies overlook the dynamic nature of the interconnections among human society, economic system, and environmental system. In addition, the effects of socioeconomic structural transitions on environmental impacts remain unknown. This review proposes four prospects and possible solutions that will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions among human society, economic system, and environmental system. They can help identify more effective solutions to reduce environmental impacts through socioeconomic transitions. (C) The Author(s) 2023.

Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) methods are recognised approaches to navigate deep uncertainties and support robust and adaptable decisions. However, their ability to fully reflect the context in which these decisions are made has been criticised. This paper presents a synthesis across cases and methods to provide a holistic understanding of the application of DMDU methods to support long-term decision making. We carried out a structured literature review and analysed 37 infrastructure DMDU case studies. The analysis shows that DMDU methods are effective at developing plans to address a range of deep uncertainties and in some cases, reflecting the institutional context of the decision. However, they largely overlook the organisational and individual contexts in which decision making happens. We argue that the use of existing DMDU methods in practice should start with a better understanding of the institutional, organisational and individual contexts. We then suggest modifications to the applications of DMDU methods, i.e. internalising the context at different stages of the decision-making process and developing a decision typology to signpost decision makers to the best approach for a specific context. ","Risk reduction through urban spatial resilience: A theoretical framework Resilience provides an adaptive approach for dealing with environmental change, natural risks and public health emergencies. Urban spatial resilience is an interpretation of resilience in the spatial dimension. However, studies on urban spatial resilience and the relationship between resilience and urban space are limited. This study tries to understand urban spatial systems and to establish an urban spatial resilience theoretical framework by integrating resilience into urban spaces to reduce urban risks. This article describes urban spatial resilience by identifying a set of urban spatial factors that may affect resilience and by linking spatial elements and resilience characteristics. The theoretical framework of urban spatial resilience has been divided into five dimensions here, urban spatial scale resilience, urban spatial structure resilience, urban spatial form resilience, urban spatial function resilience, and urban spatial network resilience. This study considers the advantages of spatial resilience from landscape ecology and urban resilience from urban studies. As a supplement to existing resilience research, this study provides a new perspective on improving the resilience of urban spaces and reduce urban risks, and guides spatial planning practitioners.

However, there is inadequate research quantifying the difference in extreme temperature between the two target levels, especially in Africa. This study used historical and future low-warming projections of NCAR-CESM to assess the differences in extreme temperature events under 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C future scenarios relative to the recent climate taken from 1976 to 2005 over Africa. The results show that compared with the present day, the magnitude of the highest temperature (TXx) will increase by approximately 1.6/2.2 degrees C in 1.5/2.0 degrees C warming worlds, with more substantial warming in Sahara and Southern Africa. The lowest temperature (TNn) will increase by similar to 1.9/2.5 degrees C in 1.5/2.0 degrees C future climates, where SAH and SAF will experience a higher intensity of warming followed by Eastern Africa and Western Africa regions. The frequency of hot days (TX90p) is projected to increase with global warming across the continent, with a high increase in SAF and SAH. The frequency of cold days (TN10p) is expected to decrease with global warming in many parts of Africa except in WAF. In most regions, there were no apparent changes revealed in the Warm Spell Duration Indicator relative to the recent climate across the continent except SAH in 1.5 and 2.0 degrees C warming levels, while a decrease in Cold Spell Duration Indicator will be in SAH. Assessment of the avoided impacts in 1.5 relative to 2.0 degrees C indicates that limiting global warming at 1.5 rather than 2.0 degrees C could reduce the intensity, frequency and duration of extreme temperatures from 3 to 81%. However, the magnitude of avoided impacts differs among indices and sub-regions. Hence, it is paramount for the African continent to limit global warming at 1.5 instead of 2.0 degrees C.

This paper explored the potential of climate finance to support Caribbean Small Island Developing States (SIDS) ef-forts in achieving their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement in the energy sector. A comprehensive overview of the region's perspective on climate financing needs for mitigation and adaptation activities in meeting their climate targets in the energy sector was conducted. The paper also examined whether the Caribbean acknowledges a role for domestic financing, private sector finance, and fiscal policy reform within their NDCs, as ways to address mitigation and adaptation in energy. The methodology adopted was a content analysis of Caribbean countries' NDCs and updated NDCs. The data used for the content analysis were obtained from initial and updated NDCs for sixteen Caribbean SIDS. The paper finds that the Caribbean established ambitious mitigation and adaptation goals for its energy sector but is heavily dependent on international climate finance which is not adequate to attain its energy NDCs, while there is a lack of private sector financing as well as innovative domestic private and public sector financing and reform of fiscal incentives to realize these goals. ","Assessing land-based mitigation implications for biodiversity The Paris Agreement to keep global temperature increase to well-below 2 degrees C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C requires to formulate ambitious climate-change mitigation scenarios to reduce CO2 emissions and to enhance carbon sequestration. These scenarios likely require significant land-use change. Failing to mitigate climate change will result in an unprecedented warming with significant biodiversity loss. The mitigation potential on land is high. However, how land-based mitigation options potentially affect biodiversity is poorly understood. Some land-based mitigation options could also counter the biodiversity loss. Here we reviewed the recently scientific literature to assess twenty land-based mitigation options that are implemented in different mitigation pathways to comply with the Paris Agreement for their biodiversity impacts by using the Mean Species Abundance (MSA(LU)) indicator for land use. We showed the likely land-use transition and potential MSA(LU) changes for each option, compared their carbon sequestration opportunities (tC per ha) and assessed the resulting biodiversity change in two case scenarios. Our results showed that most options benefit biodiversity. Reforestation of cultivated and managed areas together with restoration of wetlands deliver the largest MSA(LU) increases, if land is allowed to reach a mature state over time. A quarter of the assessed options, including intensification of agricultural areas and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, decreased MSA(LU). Options, such as afforestation and reduced deforestation, either positively or negatively affected MSA(LU). This depends on their local implementation and adopted forest-conservation schemes. Comparing the different options showed that avoiding deforestation by implementing agroforestry at the expense of pastures delivered both the largest MSA(LU) increases and the highest carbon sequestration opportunities. However, agroforestry that leads to deforestation, enhanced carbon sequestration slightly but with a marginal MSA(LU) increase. This stresses the importance of avoiding forest conversion. Our study advances the understanding on current and future benefits and adverse effects of land-based mitigation options on biodiversity. This certainly helps biodiversity conservation and determines the regions with large land-based mitigation potential.

In the Philippines, these are expected to be more common in coastal areas. The common approach to mitigate disasters in this area is to enhance the inherent capabilities of local communities to reduce the effects. Thus, this study proposed an index for a disaster-resilient coastal community at the local level. The composites of the index were determined through a process of prioritizing national-level components of a risk-management and vulnerability-reduction system. The process followed a Delphi technique, wherein 20 decision makers in Baler, Aurora, the Philippines identified criteria and elements that can be used to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities using paired comparisons for the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The results showed that the environmental and natural resource management, sustainable livelihood, social protection, and planning regimes were very important and represented >= 70% of the overall weights of criteria subjected to comparisons. These criteria and their elements represented the local-level outcome indicators of the composite index for a disaster-resilient coastal community, which was measured using a weighted linear average (WLC) approach to both outcome and process indicators. The index could be used by local governments as a tool to facilitate meaningful disaster-risk reduction and management. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In response to climatic changes, species around the world have already started to shift their ranges along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. However, it remains unclear whether the areas currently managed for biodiversity protection are optimized for these shifting ranges. Climate velocities represent a method to quantify the rate at which organisms must alter their range to maintain their current climate envelope. Here we use a case study of the Southern Rockies region in the western United States to show how forward and backward climate velocities can be used to quantify potential impacts of climatic changes and delineate abiotic climate refugia. We further illustrate how climate velocities can integrate into a process that simultaneously identifies climate refugia for suites of species while accounting for additional landscape factors contributing to protected area success. These results demonstrate how potential climatic changes may be used to prioritize the efficient selection of climate refugia, potentially aiding multi-target climate adaptation decision-making across broad regions.

The study was motivated by a common warm temperature bias over the plains of northern India that has been noticed in several global and regional climate models. To address this warm bias and its relation to STC, two sensitivity experiments have been performed with the regional climate model REMO of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology. The control experiment uses the standard soil thermal characteristic of the model that corresponds to a moist soil. The second experiment uses modified STC that characterize a dry soil, which is more representative of the considered region, as a large part of the region has arid, semi-arid or subtropical summer wet conditions. Both experiments were conducted over 20 years using re-analysis data as lateral boundary conditions. Results show that using the modified STC the predominant regional warm bias has reduced substantially, leading to a better and more realistic surface temperature compared to observations over south Asia. Although, the magnitude of bias has reduced, the warm bias still exists over the region suggesting that other atmospheric and land surface processes also play a role, such as aerosols and irrigation. These need to be addressed adequately in future modeling studies over the region.

PF. WRF is a new model that is a combination of the Weather Research and Forecasting ( WRF) atmospheric model and a parallel hydrology model (ParFlow) that fully integrates three-dimensional, variably saturated subsurface flow with overland flow. These models are coupled in an explicit, operator-splitting manner via the Noah land surface model (LSM). Here, the coupled model formulation and equations are presented and a balance of water between the subsurface, land surface, and atmosphere is verified. The improvement in important physical processes afforded by the coupled model using a number of semi-idealized simulations over the Little Washita watershed in the southern Great Plains is demonstrated. These simulations are initialized with a set of offline spinups to achieve a balanced state of initial conditions. To quantify the significance of subsurface physics, compared with other physical processes calculated in WRF, these simulations are carried out with two different surface spinups and three different microphysics parameterizations in WRF. These simulations illustrate enhancements to coupled model physics for two applications: water resources and wind-energy forecasting. For the water resources example, it is demonstrated how PF. WRF simulates explicit rainfall and water storage within the basin and runoff. Then the hydrographs predicted by different microphysics schemes within WRF are compared. Because soil moisture is expected to impact boundary layer winds, the applicability of the model to wind-energy applications is demonstrated by using PF.

The mountainous landscape of the Cinque Terre (eastern Liguria, Italy) is increasingly popular for both Italian and foreign tourists, most of which visit this outstanding terraced coastal landscape to enjoy a beach holiday and to practice hiking. However, this area is characterized by a high level of landslide hazard due to intense rainfalls that periodically affect its rugged and steep territory. One of the most severe events occurred on 25 October 2011, causing several fatalities and damage for millions of euros. To adequately address the issues related to shallow landslide risk, it is essential to develop landslide susceptibility models as reliable as possible. Regrettably, most of the current land-use and urban planning approaches only consider the susceptibility to landslide detachment, neglecting transit and runout processes. In this study, the adoption of a combined approach allowed to estimate shallow landslide susceptibility to both detachment and potential runout. At first, landslide triggering susceptibility was assessed using Machine Learning techniques and applying the Ensemble approach. Nine predisposing factors were chosen, while a database of about 300 rainfall-induced shallow landslides was used as input. Then, a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based procedure was applied to estimate the potential landslide runout using the ""reach angle"" method. Information from such analyses was combined to obtain a susceptibility map describing detachment, transit, and runout. The obtained susceptibility map will be helpful for land planning, as well as for decision makers and stakeholders, to predict areas where rainfall-induced shallow landslides are likely to occur in the future and to identify areas where hazard mitigation measures are needed. shallow landslides; susceptibility mapping; machine learning; runout modeling; GIS-based approach; reach angle; Cinque Terre National Park;TERRE NATIONAL-PARK; DEBRIS FLOW; CINQUE TERRE; LAND-USE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; MITIGATION MEASURES; INTENSE RAINFALL; CAMPANIA REGION; OCTOBER 2011","Beyond generic adaptive capacity: exploring the adaptation space of the water supply and wastewater sector of the Stockholm region, Sweden This paper examines the processes by which the generic adaptive capacity of a system is translated into adaptation to climate change, what form it takes, and what factors facilitate or restrain such processes. This is done by an in-depth analysis of climate change adaptation in the Water supply and Wastewater (WW) sector of the Stockholm region. Observed adaptations are categorized in terms of building adaptive capacity and implementing adaptive decisions, and these measures are analyzed using a model of the adaptation process based on organizational learning theories. In particular, the concept of an organization's actual adaptation space is defined and used as a means to understand the adaptation options that different WW organizations can pursue, as well as why such options might be pursued. The paper finds that most adaptation measures in the WW sector of the Stockholm region are aimed at building the adaptive capacity of the sector. It also finds that the extent to which adaptation measures can be pursued by the WW organizations is determined principally by how able the organization is to justify the additional resources required for adaptation. The analysis shows that there are two main routes to address this: use of climate knowledge to argue that adaptation is needed, and reference to rules and regulations to show that it is required. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; VULNERABILITY; EVOLUTION; SHIFTS","Indigenous farmers' perception of climate change and the use of local knowledge to adapt to climate variability: A case study of Vietnam This research investigated indigenous farmers' perception of climate change and the use of local knowledge for climate change adaptation. Survey and focus group discussion methods were used to collect data from 362 respondents. Logit model was employed to determine the factors influencing farmers' perception of climate change. Results show that farmers are aware of the climate variability citing hotter weather and unpredictable rain. Farmers use local knowledge and local agricultural practices to adapt to climate change. Moreover, farmers' perception of climate change was determined by many factors such as education, location and income. The results suggest that policymakers should consider local knowledge, farmers' perception of climate change and other contributing factors when designing and formulating policies for indigenous farmers.

Considering the hybrid concept of green infrastructure, this paper aims to provide an ""ecological model"" of achieving territorial cohesion in spatial and urban planning. Based on the connectivity level analysis between green infrastructure elements (green infrastructure hubs, nodes, gateways and dots), application of the GI concept guides the development of spatial planning scenarios. The application of Voronoi diagrams and landscape graph-based principles contribute to defining the shortest distances between green infrastructure elements, which resulted in the definition of the significance of structural and functional arrangement of green infrastructure dots in the matrix of the urban rural continuum in the territory of the urban-rural landscape of three case studies in Vojvodina, Serbia (Novi Sad, Subotica, Zrenjanin). As a result of this study, green infrastructure dots showed a great potential of application at the local level by developing them through landscape design with creative and artistic elements in order to achieve higher level of cohesion through visual attractivity, multifunctionality and recreation. The level of connectivity between elements of green infrastructure should be considered as an indicator of the sustainable spatial development goals achievement, in the field of nature conservation and territorial and social cohesion. urban-rural landscape; urbanization; cohesion; connectivity; green infrastructure; ecological dimension of territorial cohesion;CLIMATE-CHANGE","Multiobjective optimization of low impact development stormwater controls Green infrastructure such as Low Impact Development (LID) controls are being employed to manage the urban stormwater and restore the predevelopment hydrological conditions besides improving the stormwater runoff water quality. Since runoff generation and infiltration processes are nonlinear, there is a need for identifying optimal combination of LID controls. A coupled optimization-simulation model was developed by linking the U.S. EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to the Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (Borg MOEA). The coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses SWMM simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem. The optimization-simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development (LID) stormwater controls. A SWMM model was developed, calibrated, and validated for a sewershed in Windsor, Ontario and LID stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods. LID implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization-simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers, reducing total runoff, and minimizing cost. For the sewershed in Windsor, Ontario, the peak run off and total volume of the runoff were found to reduce by 13% and 29%, respectively.

Scrutinizing emerging expert visions of equity This paper examines how notions of equity are being evoked by expert advocates of more research into solar geoengineering. We trace how specific understandings of equity figure centrally-although not always explicitly-in these expert visions. We find that understandings of equity in such ""vanguard visions"" are narrowly conceived as epistemic challenges, answerable by (more) scientific analysis. Major concerns about equity are treated as empirical matters, requiring scientific assessment of feasibility, risks, or ""win-win"" distributive outcomes and optimizations, with concurrent calls to delimit risk or reduce scientific uncertainties. We argue that such epistemic framings sidestep, inter alia, the inequality in resources available to diverse non-experts-including the ""vulnerable"" evoked in expert visions-to project their own equity perspectives onto imagined technological pathways of the future. These may include concerns relating to moral or historical responsibility and/or lack of agency in shaping the directions of innovation. We conclude that the performative power and political implications of specific expert visions of equity, evoked as a rationale to undertake solar geoengineering research, require continued scrutiny. ","The Impact of Building Thermal Anisotropy on Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity Estimation: An Observational Case Study in Beijing The surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) defined as the average temperature difference between urban and rural surfaces is mainly measured by satellite remote-sensing techniques. However, the satellite can only provide 2-D land surface temperature (LST) and not complete surface temperature (T-c) which integrates the horizontal and vertical urban surface temperatures. The thermal anisotropy is very much prominent in the urban system; therefore, T-c may be more important than the 2-D LST for SUHII study. Furthermore, the 3-D LST measurement of a real urban is limited. In this letter, we measured a building's 3-D surface temperatures in Beijing, China, and the roof temperature (T-roof) was assumed as ""satellite measurement."" The SUHII using Troof (SUHII_T-roof) and T-c (SUHII_T-c), as well as air urban heat island intensity (AUHII) were compared. Results showed that: 1) the building's thermal anisotropy was evident with 18 K between roof and north wall at noon; 2) SUHII_T-c during the day was actually a cold island, while SUHII_T-roof was a heat island, caused by the different diurnal variation of T-c and T-roof; and 3) The SUHII_T-roof has diurnal maximum value in daytime and minimum value in nighttime, which is opposite to AUHII. However, the diurnal pattern of SUHII_T-c is similar to AUHII which is like the shape of a spoon. This letter preliminarily explores the building's thermal anisotropy on SUHII and could be an important reference for urban SUHII study at microscale.

In this regard, reservoir systems have an important role to manage water resources. Thus, it is essential to optimize the management of water resources. Optimizing reservoir systems involves complications such as nonlinear functions, large number of sizing variables and numerous constraints. To solve complicated optimization problems, meta-heuristic optimization algorithms are reliable and powerful methods. Hence, the present paper applies gradient evolution (GE) algorithm to optimize reservoir operation systems. This algorithm is extracted from a gradient-based optimizer. In fact, the main novelty of this study is the application of GE algorithm to optimize single- and multi-reservoir systems. Accordingly, the GE is employed to optimize a four-reservoir system, the Khersan-1 reservoir and the Dez reservoir in Iran. The results confirm the high capacity of the GE to optimize the single and multi-reservoir systems as it can obtain solutions 99.99, 96 and 94% of global optimum for the four-reservoir, Khersan-1 reservoir and Dez reservoir operation problems respectively. The results of the GE are compared with those solutions calculated with linear programming (LP), non-linear programming (NLP) and genetic algorithm (GA), which corroborate the superior ability of GE to reach global optimum solution of reservoir operation systems.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the level of stakeholder participation in the Ghana National Climate Change Policy. It examines the actors in the policy space and the negotiations and tradeoffs made during the policymaking process. Finally, it outlines the steps undertaken to make the process participatory and consultative. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative method has been used for this paper. The research design involves a review of relevant literature on Ghana's climate change regime, meeting reports and key informant interviews. Findings - The findings indicate that the processes the policy underwent had extensive stakeholder participation. An uptake of evidence was from existing impact and vulnerability assessments, the first and second communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), scientific and research documents and expert knowledge. Key actors were identified and involved right from the beginning of the policymaking process. Although stakeholder participation was time-consuming, expensive and elongated, the policy process was vital for buy-in and ownership. The results also identified the need to include more stakeholders at the sub-regional levels in policymaking. Originality/value - The study is the first of its kind detailing stakeholder participation in the climate change policy process in Ghana. It forms a good basis for comparative studies with similar policies in other countries. Thus, this paper fills an identified gap of the need to document climate change policymaking processes.

The impacts of the early urbanization process and the rapid development of the international metropolis on the interactive development of spatial zoning, urban climate, and urbanization in the main region of Shanghai are studied. This study has important practical and methodological implications with respect to two major themes in the current urban planning area of China, specifically, the construction of new urbanization and the changes in urban climate adaptation. Through the experiences of the human activities model from ecology, factors are selected based on the effects of climate on four dimensions, namely, economy, urban construction, ecological, and environment, where the weight of each index is determined by the coefficient of the variation method and the important spatial factors influencing the climate effect are screened out. The four important influential factors are population density, road density, built-up areas, and the green coverage ratio of spatial distribution. A quantitative analysis determined that there exists a consistent relationship between urban climate factors and the four urbanization spatial factors. Based on urbanization classification that considered each factor evaluation along with integrated analyses and statistical correlation analyses of the spatial grid index using ArcGIS software, the urban space partition level is identified, and urban spatial zoning strategies based on the co-movement of urban climate system are put forward. Combined with the zoning study of land use and the urban heat island distribution pattern, the spatial zoning strategy of controlling urbanization intensity based on the urban climate system is proposed. This research will guide the integration of the urbanization spatial structure and urban climate system toward rational development in Shanghai city. urbanization; districted urbanization; urban climate; districted development strategy; Shanghai;HEAT-ISLAND; LOCAL CLIMATE; IMPACT; REGION","Recent advances in risk assessment and risk management of geologic CO2 storage This paper gives an overview of the advances made in the field of risk assessment and risk management of geologic CO2 storage (GCS), since the publication of the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Capture and Storage in 2005. Development and operation of a wide range of demonstration projects coupled with development of new regulations for safe injection and storage of CO2 have led to development and deployment of a range of risk assessment approaches. New methods and tools have been developed for quantitative and qualitative risk assessment. These methods have been integrated effectively with monitoring and mitigation techniques and deployed in the field for small-scale field tests as well as large-scale commercial projects. An important development has been improved definition of risks, which can be broadly classed as site performance risks, long-term containment risks, public perception risks and market risks. Considerable experience has now been gained on understanding and managing site performance risks. Targeted research on containment risks and induced seismicity risks has led to improved understanding of parameters and processes influencing these risks as well as identifying key uncertainties that need to be targeted. Finally, significant progress has been made to effectively integrate communication strategies with risk management approaches to increase stakeholder confidence in effectiveness of deployed risk management approaches to manage risks.

In both countries, the national impetus for local adaptation is weak; it is largely left to local actors to take the initiative. The dynamics of the different approaches to climate-change adaptation at the local level are illuminated. Using decision-making and learning theory, we present an analytical framework to examine four cases, two in Norway and two in Denmark, which represent two different responses, i.e. anticipatory actions and obligatory actions. We find that, by bringing in knowledge and resources and engaging in persuasive communication across sectors, the presence of institutional entrepreneurs in the adaptation process plays a key role in building legitimacy for anticipatory action in the municipal organisation. learning; climate-change adaptation; legitimacy building; local governments; decision-making; institutional entrepreneurs;EMBEDDED AGENCY; POLICY; STRATEGY; ABILITY; SEA","Carbon Storage Potential of Agroforestry System near Brick Kilns in Irrigated Agro-Ecosystem The current study was conducted to estimate the carbon (C) storage status of agroforestry systems, via a non-destructive strategy. A total of 75 plots (0.405 ha each) were selected by adopting a lottery method of random sampling for C stock estimations for soil, trees and crops in the Mandi-Bahauddin district, Punjab, Pakistan. Results revealed that the existing number of trees in selected farm plots varied from 25 to 30 trees/ha. Total mean tree carbon stock ranged from 9.97 to 133 Mg C ha(-1), between 5-10 km away from the brick kilns in the study area. The decreasing order in terms of carbon storage potential of trees was Eucalyptus camaldulensis > Syzygium cumin > Popolus ciliata > Acacia nilotica > Ziziphus manritiana > Citrus sinensis > Azadirachtta Indica > Delbergia sisso > Bambusa vulgaris > Melia azadarach > Morus alba. Average soil carbon pools ranged from 10.3-12.5 Mg C ha(-1) in the study area. Meanwhile, maximum C stock for wheat (2.08 x 10(6) Mg C) and rice (1.97 x 10(6) Mg C) was recorded in the cultivated area of Tehsil Mandi-Bahauddin. The entire ecosystem of the study area had an estimated woody vegetation carbon stock of 68.5 Mg C ha(-1) and a soil carbon stock of 10.7 Mg C ha(-1). These results highlight that climate-smart agriculture has great potential to lock up more carbon and help in the reduction of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and can be further used in planning policies for executing tree planting agendas on cultivated lands and for planning future carbon sequestration ventures in Pakistan. agroforestry; brick kilns; carbon emissions; climate change; carbon sinks; carbon stock;CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; ORGANIC-MATTER; SEQUESTRATION; DELTOIDES; GROWTH; DYNAMICS; PRADESH; WORKERS; STOCKS","Morphological indicators of salinity stress and their relation with osmolyte associated redox regulation in mango cultivars Soil salinization is a global issue impeding horticulture production and is approaching an alarming status due to climate change and urbanization. Breeding salt-tolerant rootstock varieties is an ideal strategy to mitigate stress due to salinity in mango and other perennial fruit species. Stress combating strategies employed by seedlings of 7 mango were studied under saline conditions (200 mM NaCl, EC: > 4.0 dSm(-1), pH 8.5) in pot experiments. Significantly high accumulation of proline (19.07 mu g g(-1) FW in Bappakai), glycine betaine (55.11 mu g g(-1) FW in 13-1), and total sugars (17.33 mg g(-1) FW in Kurukkan) were found to be the common mechanism employed by the tolerant cultivars to counter the osmotic stress, under suboptimal conditions. Non-enzymatic antioxidants viz., tannins (17.18 mg g(-1)), phenols (18.68 mg g(-1)), and anthocyanins (1.59 mg g(-1)) were increased in seedling of ""13-1"", the salt-resistant cultivar from Israel. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation by increased activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase in the two polyembryonic cultivars of Indian origin (Kurukkan and Nekkare) suggests their potential use as rootstocks to combat oxidative stress. The tolerance index of various cultivars was calculated by averaging the scores of morphological stress indicators, and its correlation with studied parameters suggests that salinity resilience is more tightly linked to enhanced catalase accumulation (r(2) = 0.8361) that is reduced ionic stress. This evidence assign the role of osmotic stress alleviation and redox regulation in salt tolerance mechanism operational in native Indian cultivars, Nekkare and Kurukkan at par with known salt tolerant rootstocks.

In response, Disaster Risk Reduction policy and practice emphasize people-centred Early Warning Systems (EWS). Global policies stress the need for including local knowledge and increasing the literature on integrating local and scientific knowledge for EWS. In this paper, we present a review to understand and outline how local and scientific knowledge integration is framed in EWS, namely: (1) existing integration approaches, (2) where in the EWS integration happens, (3) outcomes, (4) challenges, and (5) enablers. The objective is to critically evaluate integration and highlight critical questions about assumptions, goals, outcomes, and processes. In particular, we unpack the impact of power and knowledges as plural. We find a spectrum of integration between knowledges in EWS, mainly with dichotomy at the start: focus on people or technology. The most popular integration approaches are participatory methods such as 'GIS mapping' (technology) and methods that focus on 'triangulation' (people). We find that critical analysis of power relations and social interaction is either missed or framed as a challenge within integration processes. Knowledge is often seen as binary, embedded in the concept of 'integration'. It is important to know what different knowledges can and cannot do in different contexts and acknowledge the hybrid reality of knowledge used for EWS. We argue that how we approach different knowledges in EWS has fundamental implications for the approaches to integration and its meaning. To this end, attention to the social processes, power dynamics, and context is crucial.

In climate policy specifically, different degrees and types of uncertainties pose a challenge to policymakers. Policy entrepreneurs and the combination of their analytical, operational and political competences are a relevant component in reducing ambiguity in policy design and translating broad policy goals to operational programmes and specific policy instruments. Using the case of the European Emission Trading Scheme, we suggest that the success of policy entrepreneurs in catalysing policy change is determined by their capacity to work against multiple kinds of uncertainty. This 'uncertainty mitigating' capacity on the part of policy entrepreneurs rests significantly on balancing managerial expertise and political acumen. We conclude that entrepreneurial capacity goes beyond current definitions in the literature, involving the balance among analytical, operational and political competences to navigate a politicized policy context.

This may explain the sustained interest in the institutional dimensions of adaptive capacity. However, a better understanding of how institutions may enable adaptive capacity is still evolving. The literature is yet to clearly articulate how institutions relate to attributes of adaptive capacity. This study contributes to address this knowledge gap; it employs an evaluative approach that underscores the relationship between types of institutions and attributes of adaptive capacity (i.e., variety, learning capacity, autonomy, leadership, resources and fair governance). Such approach is used to examine how institutions enable adaptive capacity in the context of coastal resources co-managemen in the Peam Krasaop Wildlife Sanctuary (Cambodia) and Tam Giang Lagoon (Vietnam). In this study, complexity emerges as a defining feature of adaptive capacity. It results from the relationship between institutions and adaptive capacity and the contextual factors in which such relationship takes place. Exercises aiming to assess adaptive capacity should consider the institutions-adaptive capacity nexus together with the embedding social, cultural and political context.

The primary objective of the paper is to provide theoretical basis for local water resources management and disaster prevention and reduction by analyzing the multiscale variability of precipitation and their teleconnection with large-scale climate anomalies in Xi'an city of China. The change characteristics of precipitation and extreme precipitation indices were investigated using Mann-Kendall test, Spearman's rank correlation and wavelet analysis. The cross wavelet transform and wavelet coherence were used to explore the correlations between the precipitation and large-scale teleconnection indices such as Arctic Oscillation (AO), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and sunspot. Results indicate that: the precipitation was mainly concentrated in summer, followed by autumn. The annual, seasonal and monthly precipitation except June and August had decreasing trends, and the magnitudes of precipitation decrease were more pronounced in spring, April and November. The change patterns varied for extreme precipitation indices. The temporal variation in extreme precipitation indices indicated that the extreme precipitation events had mainly increased during 1971-1990 and 1991-2017, and decreased during 1951-1970 and 1951-2017, especially, increased more pronounced during 1991-2017 and decreased more pronounced during 1951-1970. The precipitation exhibited a fluctuant change from increase to decrease, then increase to decrease and finally increase trends, and there was an abrupt change point in 1965. The annual precipitation had statistically significant cycles of 3-5 year and 7-10 year at 5% significance level. The large-scale teleconnection indices affected the precipitation in Xi'an city. The phase differences between precipitation and teleconnection indices including AO and SOI were in-phase dominated, and anti-phase dominated between precipitation and teleconnection indices including ENSO and sunspot, indicating that the AO and SOI exerted positive climate impacts on the precipitation and vice-versa for ENSO and sunspot.

Data were collected from 1538 rice farmers in the province of Hubei, China. We empirically examine the determinants of rice growers' intentions towards mitigation and adaption and their actual behaviors via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results indicate that for TPB, behavioral intentions and perceived behavioral control account for 42.1% of farmers' adaptation behaviors, but only 25.6% for mitigation behaviors. In contrast, for the VBN theory, proenvironmental personal norms explain 54.2% of growers' mitigation behaviors, but only 28.4% of adaptation behaviors. Thus, TPB appears to be more successful at predicting self-interest-oriented behaviors, such as climate change adaptation. On the other hand, our findings provide evidence that the VBN theory performs better when explaining altruistic behaviors like mitigation behaviors. These conclusions have important implications for the formulation of future policies that aim to promote effective and sustainable proenvironmental behavioral changes in agriculture, while ensuring global food security. theory of planned behavior; Value-belief-norm theory; Climate change; Mitigation behavior; Adaptation behavior; Rice production;PRO-ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; CONSERVATION BEHAVIOR; PLS-SEM; PROENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR; MANAGEMENT RESEARCH; PERSONAL NORMS; FARMERS; FOOD; POLICIES; BARRIERS","Electrification and renewable energy nexus in developing countries; an overarching analysis of hydrogen production and electric vehicles integrality in renewable energy penetration As the world continues to fight against climate change, renewables have emerged as an imminent solution, however, a model that can help (developing) countries to effectively migrate to a renewable energy-based power sector is limited in literature. In this study, a comprehensive electricity generation analysis based on an hourly time-step is done in a bid to solve to electrification crisis in developing countries. This study aims to present the feasible pathways with which sustainable electrification can be achieved. This is done by considering the financial feasibility, environmental sustainability, and technical viability of different technological combinations. In comparison to existing literature, this study is novel as the integration of both renewable energy sources and a fossil fuel source is analyzed. With Nigeria being the study area, the integration of five renewable energybased technologies namely; offshore wind power plant, onshore wind power plant, solar photovoltaic system, concentrated solar power plant, and hydropower plant as well as pumped hydro storage system is considered within the scope of this study. Based on the results of the analysis, out of the ninety-nine different combinatory scenarios modeled, the most viable solution with the use of renewables and natural gas is the combination of natural gas power plants, on-shore wind power plants, and solar photovoltaic systems. This requires a large capacity installation (32,500 MW of natural gas power plant, 12,000 MW of solar photovoltaic plant, and 7000 MW of on-shore wind power plant) as well as a total annual cost and an investment cost of $ 22B and $ 48.7B. Furthermore, solving the poised problem based on renewable energy technologies will only require the combination of on-shore wind power plants, hydropower plants, solar photovoltaic system, and pumped hydro storage system. The integration of plug-in battery electric vehicles and hydrogen production will help maximize the electricity produced from the renewable energy-based power systems. This will also reduce the overall carbon emission from the country at large. Beyond providing feasible scenarios and plans to tackle the existing electricity production, guidelines on steps (not to take) to tackle the electrification problem are embedded in this study.

Results: Participants welcomed increased community connectedness in response to prolonged drought but reported that drought's mental health impact was mainly negative. Adults observed children's distress, wondering if anyone else noticed it. They witnessed young people worrying about their families, increasingly isolated, at risk of harm, unable to obtain help and facing educational and employment limitations. Young people disclosed many mental health and relationship difficulties at school and at home. They worried about their families, communities and futures and about money and being isolated. Conclusion: Adults and young people reported similar effects of prolonged drought on young people's mental health. But, while adults were more concerned with risks to young people (of harm, abuse, homelessness, problems with the law and constrained opportunities), young people were simply overwhelmed, wanting help for their immediate worries. They sought coordinated support within schools, schools working together, more information about mental health and where to seek help for them and their friends, and support people who understood drought and rural circumstances and on whose discretion they could rely. Mental health programs that are developed in and for metropolitan contexts need to be adapted before being deployed in rural settings. adolescent; children; climate change; psychiatric; rural adversity;ADOLESCENTS; IMPACT","Quantifying Dam-Induced Fluctuations in Streamflow Frequencies Across the Colorado River Basin Periodic fluctuations in natural streamflow are a major driver of river ecosystem dynamics and water resource management. However, most U.S. rivers are impacted both by long-term hydroclimatic trends and dams that alter flow variability. Despite these impacts, it remains largely unexplored how dams affect the dominant frequencies of natural streamflow over a highly regulated river network. We investigated the entire Colorado River Basin (CRB) to understand how the annual (10-14 months) and multi-annual (24-60 months) frequencies in natural flow regimes have been progressively altered by dams. Given the significant alteration over the CRB, we captured changes in streamflow frequencies between naturalized and observed monthly flows via wavelet analysis. Based on the similarity of changes in streamflow frequencies (annual and multi-annual) over the last 30 years, sections of the riverine network were classified into four groups. The annual frequency was relatively well preserved downstream of Hoover Dam, while showing a systematic trend of alteration downstream of Glen Canyon Dam until Hoover Dam. Meanwhile, the multi-annual frequency component was highly altered for the entire Lower Colorado main stem (i.e., downstream of Glen Canyon). We also identified dams with significant impacts on streamflow frequency by comparing wavelet coherence estimates. This study advances the notion that dams fundamentally alter river flow regimes across multiple frequencies and with varying amplitudes over time and space, with alteration propagating - or being dampened - by both hydroclimatic fluctuations and water resource management. flow alteration; flow regime; wavelet coherence; dam impacts; water management; flow regulation;SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION; WAVELET ANALYSIS; HYDROLOGIC ALTERATION; FLOW REGULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER; FRAGMENTATION; PRECIPITATION; VARIABILITY; DOWNSTREAM","Wetlands of International Importance: Status, Threats, and Future Protection The 2303 Wetlands of International Importance distribute unevenly in different continents. Europe owns the largest number of sites, while Africa has the largest area of sites. More than half of the sites are affected by three or four impact factors (55%). The most significant impact factors are pollution (54%), biological resources use (53%), natural system modification (53%), and agriculture and aquaculture (42%). The main affected objects are land area and environment of the wetlands, occurred in 75% and 69% of the sites, respectively. The types most affected by land area occupation are river wetlands and lake wetlands, the types with the greatest impact on environment are marine/coastal wetlands and river wetlands, the type with the greatest impact on biodiversity is river wetlands, the types most affected by water resources regulation are marsh wetlands and river wetlands, and the types most affected by climate change are lake wetlands and marine/coastal wetlands. About one-third of the wetland sites have been artificially reconstructed. However, it is found that the proportions of natural wetland sites not affected or affected by only one factor are generally higher than that of wetland sites both containing natural wetlands and human-made wetlands, while the proportions of wetland sites both containing natural wetlands and human-made wetlands affected by three or four factors are generally higher than that of natural wetland sites. Wetland sites in the UK and Ireland are least affected among all countries. Wetland management plans in different regions still have large space for improvement, especially in Africa and Asia. The protection and restoration of global wetlands can be carried out in five aspects, including management and policy, monitoring, restoration, knowledge, and funding.

Maize production and soybean imports are increasing significantly to meet the strong demand for feed by a rapidly growing livestock industry. Extension of the rice and maize growing seasons in northeastern China and improvement of the cropping system through delayed wheat planting have contributed to improving cereal productivity despite changing climatic conditions. Significant improvements in yield potential of rice, maize, and wheat have been achieved. Comparative genomics has been successfully used to develop and validate functional markers for processing quality traits in wheat, and also for developing new varieties. Although transgenic Bt rice and maize, and maize expressing phytase have been developed, their commercialization has not been officially permitted. International collaboration has contributed significantly to cereal production by providing germplasm and improved crop management practices. Full integration of applied molecular technologies into conventional breeding programs and promotion of lower-input technologies, will play a key role in increasing and sustaining future cereal production. ","Impacts of the 1998 and 2010 mass coral bleaching events on the Western Gulf of Thailand A long-term study of coral reef ecology in the Gulf of Thailand provides a good opportunity to examine the temporal variation on the impact of mass coral bleaching at those reef sites. We compared the bleaching and mortality of corals between the mass bleaching events in 1998 and 2010 at a coral community in the Western Gulf of Thailand. The aim was to identify the coral species which were most likely to suffer from (and to be able to tolerate) changes in seawater temperature. Significant differences in the susceptibility of the coral taxa to bleaching events between the years 1998 and 2010 and among coral species were documented. Bleaching was significantly different between the most dominant corals. Diploastrea heliopora was the most resistant coral to bleaching in both years. Some coral species showed more resistance to bleaching in 2010. The coral mortality following the mass bleaching events in 1998 and 2010 varied significantly between the years and the coral taxa. Mortality of some dominant coral taxa was also lower in 2010. Seven coral species, i.e. Astreopora myriophthalma, Pachyseris rugosa, Turbinaria mesenterina, Goniastrea pectinata, Favia pallida, F. maritima, Favites halicora, Platygyra daedalea and Galaxea fascicularis, were tolerant to the coral bleaching events. An ecosystem-based approach to managing coral reefs in the Gulf of Thailand is needed to identify appropriate marine protected area networks and to strengthen marine and coastal resource policies in order to build coral reef resilience.

Because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the US, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). The benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). Annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 US housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. These other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life. In addition, such a window replacement effort would reduce peak demand for electricity, carbon emissions from power plants, and associated long-term costs of climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

However, the changes in shallow coastal regions, like the marginal seas near China, cannot be fully resolved in GCMs. To improve regional sea level simulations, a high-resolution (similar to 8 km) regional ocean model is set up for the marginal seas near China for both the historical (1994-2015) and future (2079-2100) periods under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The historical ocean simulations are evaluated at different spatiotemporal scales, and the model is then integrated for the future period, driven by projected monthly climatological climate change signals from eight GCMs individually via both surface and open boundary conditions. The downscaled ocean changes derived by comparing historical and future experiments reveal greater spatial details than those from GCMs, such as a low dynamic sea level (DSL) center of -0.15 m in the middle of the South China Sea (SCS). As a novel test, the downscaled results driven by the ensemble mean forcings are almost identical with the ensemble average results from individually downscaled cases. Forcing of the DSL change and increased cyclonic circulation in the SCS are dominated by the climate change signals from the Pacific, while the DSL change in the East China marginal seas is caused by both local atmosphere forcing and signals from the Pacific. The method of downscaling developed in this study is a useful modeling protocol for adaptation and mitigation planning for future oceanic climate changes.

Tensions exist between the two dominant research orientations of research about and research for adaptation. In particular, the research community is challenged to develop processes for successfully executing transdisciplinary research for adaptation when academic institutions and researchers are largely structured around traditional, disciplinary expertise and funding models. One tool for helping to manage this tension is a third, more reflexive, orientation toward adaptation research that is emerging in the literature. This new 'research on adaptation research' promises to help enhance understanding of the research enterprise itself and how it can become more adaptive. nan;ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; FOREST MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS; SCIENCE; POLICY; VULNERABILITY; SCIENTISTS; IMPACT; TRANSDISCIPLINARITY","Arabidopsis ABF3 and ABF4 Transcription Factors Act with the NF-YC Complex to Regulate SOC1 Expression and Mediate Drought-Accelerated Flowering The drought-escape response accelerates flowering in response to drought stress, allowing plants to adaptively shorten their life cycles. Abscisic acid (ABA) mediates plant responses to drought, but the role of ABA-responsive element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) in the drought-escape response is poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis thaliana ABF3 and ABF4 regulate flowering in response to drought through transcriptional regulation of the floral integrator SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1). The abf3 abf4 mutant displayed ABA-insensitive late flowering under long-day conditions. Ectopic expression of ABF3 or ABF4 in the vasculature, but not in the shoot apex, induced early flowering, whereas expression of ABF3 fused with the SRDX transcriptional repressor domain delayed flowering. We identified SOC1 as a direct downstream target of ABF3/4, and found that SOC1 mRNA levels were lower in abf3 abf4 than in wild-type plants. Moreover, induction of SOC1 by ABA was hampered in abf3 abf4 mutants. ABF3 and ABF4 were enriched at the -1028- to -657-bp region of the SOC1 promoter, which does not contain canonical ABF-ABRE-binding motifs but has the NF-Y binding element. We found that ABF3 and ABF4 interact with nuclear factor Y subunit C (NF-YC) 3/4/9 in vitro and in planta, and induction of SOC1 by ABA was hampered in nf-yc3 yc4 yc9 mutants. Interestingly, the abf3 abf4, nf-yc3 yc4 yc9, and soc/ mutants displayed a reduced drought-escape response. Taken together, these results suggest that ABF3 and ABF4 act with NF-YCs to promote flowering by inducing SOC1 transcription under drought conditions. This mechanism might contribute to adaptation by enabling plants to complete their life cycles under drought stress. drought escape; abscisic acid; ABF3; ABF4; NF-YC; SOC1;TIME GENE SOC1; ABSCISIC-ACID; LOCUS-T; NEGATIVE REGULATOR; BETA-GLUCURONIDASE; FLORAL TRANSITION; STRESS TOLERANCE; TARGET GENES; ABA; ACTIVATION","The emerging hypercarbon reality, technological and post-carbon utopias, and social innovation to low-carbon societies Emphasis has shifted in climate change politics from fear to dreams and opportunities. This article demonstrates that many social science analyses of anthropogenic climate change are characterized by utopian presumptions, including technological mastery of nature, and that key concepts such as post-carbon society, decarbonization, low-carbon transitions, ecological direction of travel, and ecological modernization have not been defined in terms of the absolute amount of emissions appropriate for anthropogenic global warming. It shows that time-cost discounting is erroneous. These misleading conceptions give false positives for improvement and sustain wishful thinking in societies that have locked themselves into carbon-based infrastructures where default options are fossil fuels leading to an emerging path-dependent hypercarbon world. The article explains how those concepts can be reconceptualized to increase validity and also suggests accurate concepts like time-cost exacerbation, low-carbon and decarbonization transition searches, and ecological modernization niches. By comparing longue duree emitting societies, it documents the superiority of (1) social democracy over neoliberalism in transitioning to low-carbon economies while enhancing democracy, equity, and prosperity, and (2) multitasking of international mitigation commitments with local mitigation, adaptation, and resilience. The article seeks to stimulate research into learning from better performing societies to innovate transitions of institutions and culture to robustly defined low-carbon economies. Resume La priorite des politiques en matiere de changement climatique s'est reorientee de la peur aux reves, en mettant l'accent sur les opportunites. Cet article montre que de nombreuses analyses des changements climatiques d'origine anthropique, proposees par les sciences sociales, se caracterisent par des presomptions utopiques telles que la maitrise technologique de la nature et que des concepts importants comme la societe post-carbone, la decarbonisation, la transition vers de faibles emissions de carbone, l'orientation ecologique des voyages et la modernisation ecologique n'ont pas ete definis en termes de quantites absolues d'emissions appropriees au rechauffement anthropique de la planete. La non prise en compte de la relation cout-temps se revele egalement erronee. Ces conceptions trompeuses presentent les faux positifs comme des ameliorations et bercent d'illusions des societes enfermees dans des infrastructures a base de carbone, oU les combustibles fossiles sont les options par defaut, menant a un monde hyper-carbone et dependant de ces nouvelles orientations. Cet article explique comment ces concepts peuvent etre redefinis pour ameliorer leur validite et suggere egalement certains concepts precis comme l'exacerbation du cout-temps, les recherches de la transition vers les faibles emissions de carbone et la decarbonisation et les niches de la modernisation ecologique. En comparant les societes emettrices de carbone sur une longue duree, l'article met en evidence la superiorite de i) la social democratie sur le neo-liberalisme dans la transition vers des economies a faibles emissions de carbone et ii) du mode de fonctionnement multitache des engagements internationaux en faveur des actions locales de reduction, d'adaptation et de resilience.

Resumen En las politicas de cambio climatico, el enfasis se ha desplazado del miedo a los suenos y oportunidades. En este articulo se demuestra que muchos analisis de las ciencias sociales sobre el cambio climatico antropogenico se caracterizan por presunciones utopicas, incluyendo el dominio tecnologico de la naturaleza, y que los conceptos clave, como sociedad post-carbono, descarbonizacion, transiciones de bajo carbono, direccion ecologica de viajes y modernizacion ecologica no se han definido en terminos de la cantidad absoluta de emisiones apropiados para el calentamiento global antropogenico. Esto demuestra que el descuento de tiempo-costo es erronea. Estas concepciones erroneas dan falsos positivos para mejorar y mantener las ilusiones en las sociedades que se han encerrado en las infraestructuras basadas en el carbono, donde las opciones por defecto son los combustibles fosiles que conducen a un camino dependiente de mundo del hipercarbono. El articulo explica como esos conceptos pueden ser reconceptualizados para aumentar la validez y tambien sugiere conceptos precisos como exacerbacion tiempo-costo, bajas emisiones de carbono y las busquedas de transicion de descarbonizacion y nichos ecologicos de modernizacion. Mediante la comparacion de las sociedades emisoras de long duree, se documenta la superioridad de i) la democracia social sobre el neoliberalismo en la transicion a economias bajas en carbono, mientras aumenta la democracia, la equidad y la prosperidad, y ii) las multiples tareas de compromisos internacionales de mitigacion con la mitigacion local, la adaptacion y la capacidad de recuperacion. El articulo pretende estimular la investigacion en el aprendizaje de sociedades de mejor rendimiento para innovar las transiciones de las instituciones y la cultura para economias bajas en carbono robustamente definidas.

Most water systems initially designed as continuous supply systems are affected by constraints such as limited freshwater supply, infrastructure inadequacy and insufficient expansion, poor operations and management, contributing to Intermittent Water Supply (IWS) or no services in some regions. IWS is a common condition in developing countries like India. Many approaches have been developed to address water availability and quality challenges, including Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM). The main principle of IUWM is to incorporate non-conventional water supply sources, such as stormwater, rooftop rainwater and recycled wastewater, to augment water supply and provide fit-for-purpose water. However, in developing countries, IUWM principles have not been sufficiently investigated to understand how they can improve water supply reliability in regions with IWS or no centralized water supply. In this study, an IUWM incorporated model was developed to understand how supply reliability can be improved in areas with IWS or no services, with Bangalore city in India, as a case study. Five different supply configurations to incorporate IUWM principles were analyzed and compared to identify the most efficient way to incorporate non-conventional water sources. The analysis identifies potential supply issues in the area under the current centralized water supply. The results show that the traditional water supply system can not meet the minimum water demand. The reliability can be improved from <50% to 100% with the incorporation of non-conventional water sources.

However, the biochemical and diffusional constraints on gas exchange in sun and shade leaves in response to light remain poorly quantified, but critical for predicting canopy carbon and water exchange. To investigate the CO2 diffusion pathway of sun and shade leaves, leaf gas exchange was coupled with concurrent measurements of carbon isotope discrimination to measure net leaf photosynthesis (A(n)), stomatal conductance (g(s)) and mesophyll conductance (g(m)) in Eucalyptus tereticornis trees grown in climate controlled whole-tree chambers. Compared to sun leaves, shade leaves had lower A(n), g(m), leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity (A(max)) but g(s) was similar. When light intensity was temporarily increased for shade leaves to match that of sun leaves, both g(s) and g(m) increased, and A(n) increased to values greater than sun leaves. We show that dynamic physiological responses of shade leaves to altered light environments have implications for up-scaling leaf level measurements and predicting whole canopy carbon gain. Despite exhibiting reduced photosynthetic capacity, the rapid up-regulation of g(m) with increased light enables shade leaves to respond quickly to sunflecks.

This study investigated 357 households in the upper reaches of the Dadu River watershed in the Eastern Tibetan Plateau, China, using the participatory rural appraisal method. Then, applying a multinomial logistic regression model, we quantitatively analyzed the relationship between livelihood assets and livelihood strategies, the findings of which have implications for local agricultural policy inteiventions. The preliminary results indicate that of the four classifications of livelihood strategies used in this study, the main livelihood strategy is that of the non-farming-dependent household type (i.e., Type III in our study) that combines agricultural and non-farm activities or practices self-employment for wages. There are significant differences in the livelihood assets owned by households with different livelihood strategies. Human, natural, and financial assets have significant influences on livelihood strategies, and the choice of livelihood strategy varies by livelihood assets. Further, with improvements in household labor capacity and cash income per capita, the livelihood strategies of non-agricultural and non-farming households may shift away from agriculture, while an increase in farmland cultivated per capita, cash income per capita, and household labor capacity may encourage households to adopt agriculture-dependent livelihood strategies. These findings contribute to research on livelihood and related development strategies and anti-poverty policies in not only the Eastern Tibetan Plateau but also other regions with similar livelihood strategies.

As such, spatial planning deals with challenges occurring at different scales and across sectors. The international literature points out the need for horizontal and vertical cooperation to tackle climate change impacts. This paper discusses the general challenges for climate proofing across planning levels, sectors, and areas and provides a systematic overview of challenges that would affect an integrative theoretical framework for climate proofing. Based on the latter, the study ultimately aims at presenting a novel theoretical framework for Climate Proofing specific to spatial planning involving a multi-sectoral perspective. An iterative process was used for conceptual development, based on a literature review followed by external feedback meetings with the core team of planning experts responsible for exchange across federal states and two workshops with focus groups of experts of planning departments responsible for federal, regional, and local spatial planning. Implementation and further development of the framework are planned as the second phase of this study. By specifically addressing the challenges relating to cross-regional and cross-sectoral planning, this novel framework attempts to discuss the (i) consideration of the hierarchy of climate proofing measures through enhanced vertical and horizontal cooperation as well as the (ii) long-term institutionalisation of integrative planning processes across planning borders. It attempts also to (iii) foster the consideration of co-benefits for joint adaptation purposes and climate change mitigation through encouraging multi-disciplinary perspectives climate proofing; spatial planning; climate change adaptation; framework; cross-regional; integral; co-benefits;CHANGE ADAPTATION; MITIGATION; IMPACTS; CITIES; WATER","The UN climate change negotiations and the role of the United States: assessing American leadership from Copenhagen to Paris The role of American leadership in the UN climate negotiations that produced the 2015 Paris Agreement is examined. First, United States (US) climate goals are identified. Then, utilizing unique survey data collected at eight UN climate summits between 2008 and 2015, the extent to which the US was recognized as a leader by potential followers is investigated. Finally, the extent to which US goals are reflected in negotiation outcomes is evaluated. Recognition of the US as a leader varied over time, peaking at the UN climate meetings in Copenhagen and Paris, reflecting US leadership in shaping the outcomes of both meetings. Although the results reveal a divided leadership landscape in which the US must compete for leadership with other actors, such as the European Union and China, US leadership was crucial to the successful adoption of the Paris Agreement.

Two different drought indices were used; SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) which considers precipitation variation only and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) which takes into account both precipitation and evapotranspiration variations. After generating the drought indices under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario used in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of IPCC, drought frequency analyses were performed and drought risks were estimated based on the joint quantiles of drought duration and severity. As a result, significant differences of drought risk were identified between SPI-and SPEI-based drought analyses using RCP 8.5 projections; mainly, the SPEI-based drought risk increases entirely across South Korea compared with the SPI-based drought risk. The outcomes of this study would be useful to develop comprehensive drought mitigation plans to cope with future climate change. climate change; drought; evapotranspiration; frequency analysis; risk;RETURN PERIOD; SEVERITY; INDEX","Looking to future perceptions about climate change in Brazil: What children's teachers think, learn and teach about? The social and human sciences have had a minor role in the studies of climate change. There remains a significant gap in our knowledge and understanding of the many facets of this theme. The educational sector has been neglected in the climate change scientific debate, although it is acknowledged as a key sector. This article aims to understand how teachers are dealing with the climate change topic: what they think, learn and teach about it. It is focused on teachers at elementary schools (6-14 years old) in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This type of social research is important for developing countries such as Brazil, where the sociological research on climate change is emergent. The identification of teachers' perceptions on climate change is an important step in finding ways to listen to and engage with them in the formulation of climate change adaptation plans, especially because they will be among the people responsible for preparing the younger generations of citizens. The survey of teachers' knowledge and perception about climate change provides two main approaches: (1) It supports better planning of future school activities, training, and updating knowledge and (2) It suggests how children are being prepared to understand and deal with this contemporary problem of climate change.

(Water Resour Manag doi:10.1007/s11269-012-0182-2, 2012) studied the impacts of climate change and human activities on the runoff for the Huifa River basin. They employed a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), which was calibrated for the baseline period 1956-1964, and then used to reconstruct the natural runoff for the climate change period 1965-2000. Results showed that both climate change and human activities decrease the observed runoff. Climate change impacts on annual runoff were -37.7, -59.5, +36.9, and -45.2 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995, and 1996-2005 respectively, compared with the baseline period 1956-1964. Human activities decreased runoff and caused a relatively larger magnitude impact than those of climate change after 1985. Human activities decreased the annual runoff by -32.9, -46.8, -67.8, and -54.9 mm/a for 1965-1975, 1976-1985, 1986-1995, and 1996-2005 respectively. Human activities further decreased runoff in wet years due to regulation and storage of water projects.

Evidence from Ghana People's lives, particularly farmers', have been affected by extreme weather conditions that have reduced the yield of numerous crops due to climate change. Climate-smart agriculture practices can reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and have the propensity to increase farm income and productivity. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to ascertain whether CSA practices impact farmers' income. This study includes all cocoa farmers in the selected districts in the Ashanti Region. The population includes those who live in the six cocoa production villages. The multistage sampling procedure was considered based on the dominants of literature. The study used an endogenous switching regression framework to examine the effects of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices (CSAPs) on farmers' income. While estimating treatment effects, telasso uses lasso techniques to select the appropriate variable sets. The results revealed that gender, farm experience, age, household size, and farm size do not significantly influence the adoption of irrigation and crop insurance. The study revealed a significant positive impact of access to credit on adopting irrigation and crop insurance. The adoption of climate-smart practices has a positive coefficient. This indicates that if all respondents in each region adopts these practices, their income would increase significantly. This study shows that adopting irrigation practices leads to an increase in household income of 8.6% and 11.1%, respectively, for cocoa farmers. Crop insurance has a positive coefficient and is statistically significant on household income, on-farm, and off-farm. This paper shows that climate-smart practices such as crop insurance can positively influence farmers' income in Ghana. We also conjecture that crop insurance is the most effective and efficient climate-smart practice among the various agricultural practices. The study suggests that access to credit and mass awareness should be compulsory modules coupled with the consistent training of farmers on new technologies for effective policy implementation. Expanding access to extension officers could enhance farmers' adaptive capacity and warrant the efficiency of implemented practices. climate change; adoption; climate-smart agricultural practices; endogenous switch regression; telasso treatment effect;IRRIGATION; YIELD; SOIL; DIVERSIFICATION; TECHNOLOGY; ADAPTATION; INSURANCE; SELECTION; TOOL","Optimization of the Thermal Insulation Level of Residential Buildings in the Almaty Region of Kazakhstan Kazakhstan is country rich in energy resources, but to raise the living standards of the country's population, the government regulates prices of heating energy, which are significantly lower comparing to those in the global energy market. Such an approach encourages the construction of residential buildings without concern for their energy efficiency, which significantly increases energy consumption in the sector and leads to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of regulated low prices of heating energy on long-term energy use in buildings, to determine optimal levels of building thermal insulation at current energy prices and following global energy price trends, and to demonstrate the impact of more efficient building thermal insulation on heating energy consumption from a long-time perspective. The cost-optimal method used in EU countries was chosen for the optimization of building thermal insulation and energy consumption to compare the impact of energy prices on the optimal thermal insulation of buildings. The results of the study showed that maintaining low energy prices hinders the implementation of energy-efficient solutions in buildings and does not provide an economic justification for prolonging the heating season by ensuring the quality of the indoor microclimate. As a practical result of this study, a recommendation was made to introduce optimal thermal insulation requirements in building regulations and to redistribute part of the energy subsidies for implementation of energy-efficient measures in the residential building sector. energy efficiency; cost optimal calculations; energy consumption in buildings;ENERGY EFFICIENCY; EXTERNAL WALLS; COST-ANALYSIS; THICKNESS; DESIGN; METHODOLOGY; IMPACTS","Managing Supplier Social and Environmental Impacts with Voluntary Versus Mandatory Disclosure to Investors A buying firm might in the future incur costs associated with a supplier's carbon dioxide emissions, safety violations, or other social or environmental impacts. Learning about a supplier's impacts requires costly effort, but it is necessary (and sometimes sufficient) to reduce those impacts. The capital market valuation of a buying firm reflects investors' estimate of future costs associated with a supplier's impacts, as well as any costs that the buying firm incurs in order to learn about and reduce a supplier's impacts. This paper analyzes a game theoretic model in which a manager-with the objective of maximizing the capital market valuation of the buying firm-decides whether to learn about a supplier's impacts, how much cost to incur to reduce the supplier's impacts, and whether to disclose the supplier's impacts to investors. The investors have rational expectations (e.g., that a manager might withhold bad news about the supplier's impacts ) and value the buying firm accordingly. The paper considers a mandate to disclose information learned about a supplier's impacts. The paper shows that the disclosure mandate deters learning and thus, under plausible conditions, results in higher expected impacts. The disclosure mandate can result in lower expected impacts only if buying firms face moderately high future costs associated with suppliers' impacts. In contrast, a disclosure mandate always increases a buying firm's expected discounted profit and capital market valuation. A disclosure mandate can induce cooperation among buying firms with a shared supplier, yet result in higher expected impacts by the supplier. When a buying firm has alternative suppliers, the disclosure mandate favors commitment to a supplier to facilitate learning about that supplier's impacts (instead of searching for a lower-impact supplier). ","Impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff change in a typical arid watershed, NW China The Shiyang River Basin is a typical arid watershed in Northwest China. Scientific understanding of the driving mechanism of runoff change is the basis of scientific utilization of water resources and regional sustainable development. In this study, runoff changes at different time scales were analyzed for the period 1960-2018, and the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff were investigated in the middle and lower reaches of the Shiyang River Basin (SRB). A combination of mutation analysis and human-designed analysis was adopted to divide the study period into the baseline period and the variation period. The Mann-Kendall test (M-K) and Double Mass Curve method (DMC) were used to detect abrupt changes and quantify the relative effects of climate change and human activities on runoff. The results reveal a significant declining trend in annual runoff on the whole in the middle and lower reaches of the SRB, and there was an obvious recovery trend after the implementation of the Comprehensive Treatment Program of the SRB (CTSRB) in 2007. Abrupt changes occurred in 1976, 1991 and 2007, which divided the study period into the baseline period (1960-1975), the Variation I period (1976-1990), the Variation II period (1991-2006) and the Variation III period (2007-2018). The contribution of human activities to runoff reduction was 88.72%, whereas the contribution of climate change to runoff reduction was only 11.28%. Furthermore, the contribution of human activities to runoff reduction in the Variation I period, Variation II period and Variation III period was 89.44%, 93.02% and 83.69%, respectively. Therefore, human activities played the most dominant role in the variation of runoff, followed by climate change and upstream runoff. Further analysis of the impact of human activities on runoff indicated that agricultural irrigation was the dominant factor of runoff reduction. This study can provide detailed information on water resources and a scientific basis for the development and utilization of water resources in the future.

Thus, 360 soil samples were collected from 72 farmland 1-m soil profiles in northeastern China, and soil physiochemical properties, nutrients, glomalin characteristics, local climates were determined. Linear decreases of glomalin amounts were observed from the top to deep soils, and glomalin/SOC (glomalin ratio to total SOC) in the 80-100 cm soil (EEG, easily-extracted GRSP, 2.2%; TG, total GRSP, 19%) was 1.34-1.5-fold higher than did in the 0-20 cm soil. Different statistical analyses crosschecked that the lower pH and higher SOC usually accompanied with the higher EEG and TG, while EEG was more sensitive to climates; Moreover, glomalin was more physiochemical-regulated in the deep soils, but more nutrient-regulation was found in the surface soils. Structure Equation Model showed that soil depths and climates indirectly affected TG and EEG features through soil properties, except significant direct effects on EEG. In future, glomalin assessment should fully consider these for identifying the AMF importance in the whole 1-m profile, and our findings also favor degrade soil improvement from glomalin rehabilitation. nan;ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EQUATION MODELING SEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; AGGREGATE STABILITY; TEMPORAL-CHANGES; PROTEIN; MANAGEMENT; FOREST; AFFORESTATION; PLANTATIONS","Factors affecting food security and contribution of modern technologies in food sustainability The concept of food insecurity is complex and goes beyond the simplistic idea of a country's inability to feed its population. The global food situation is redefined by many driving forces such as population growth, availability of arable lands, water resources, climate change and food availability, accessibility and loss. The combined effect of these factors has undeniably impacted global food production and security. This article reviews the key factors influencing global food insecurity and emphasises the need to adapt science-based technological innovations to address the issue. Although anticipated benefits of modern technologies suggest a level of food production that will sustain the global population, both political will and sufficient investments in modern agriculture are needed to alleviate the food crisis in developing countries. In this globalised era of the 21st century, many determinants of food security are trans-boundary and require multilateral agreements and actions for an effective solution. Food security and hunger alleviation on a global scale are within reach provided that technological innovations are accepted and implemented at all levels.

This is an important knowledge gap. The fluctuation of human populations over decades to centuries - population instability - may constrain the expansion of human economies. A first step toward describing basic patterns of population stability would be to identify sizes of fluctuations through time, since smaller fluctuations are more stable than larger fluctuations. We conduct a biogeographic analysis of the long-term stability of human societies in North America using a continental scale radiocarbon dataset. Our analysis compares the stability of summed calibrated radiocarbon date probability distributions (SPDs) with subsistence strategies and modeled climate stability between 6000 and 300 BP. This coarse-grained analysis reveals general trends regarding the stability of human systems in North America that future studies may build upon. Our results demonstrate that agricultural sequences have more stable SPDs than hunter-gatherer sequences in general, but agricultural sequences also experience rare, extreme increases and decreases in SPDs not seen among hunter-gatherers. We propose that the adoption of agriculture has the unintended consequence of increasing population density and stability over most time scales, but also increases the vulnerability of populations to large, rare changes. Conversely, hunter-gatherer systems remain flexible and less vulnerable to large population changes. Climate stability may have an indirect effect on long-term population stability, and climate shocks may be buffered by other aspects of subsistence strategies prior to affecting human demography. coarse-grained analysis; North America; population ecology; radiocarbon; resilience;TEMPORAL FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; NEOLITHIC DEMOGRAPHIC-TRANSITION; PROBABILITY-DISTRIBUTIONS; SETTLEMENT-PATTERNS; CALIBRATION CURVES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; C-14 DATES; POWER-LAWS; FLUCTUATIONS; ORIGINS","Sustainable bioenergy production from marginal lands in the US Midwest Legislation on biofuels production in the USA(1) and Europe(2,3) is directing food crops towards the production of grain-based ethanol(2,3), which can have detrimental consequences for soil carbon sequestration(4), nitrous oxide emissions(5), nitrate pollution(6), biodiversity(7) and human health(8). An alternative is to grow lignocellulosic (cellulosic) crops on 'marginal' lands(9). Cellulosic feedstocks can have positive environmental outcomes(10,11) and could make up a substantial proportion of future energy portfolios(12,13). However, the availability of marginal lands for cellulosic feedstock production, and the resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, remains uncertain. Here we evaluate the potential for marginal lands in ten Midwestern US states to produce sizeable amounts of biomass and concurrently mitigate GHG emissions. In a comparative assessment of six alternative cropping systems over 20 years, we found that successional herbaceous vegetation, once well established, has a direct GHG emissions mitigation capacity that rivals that of purpose-grown crops (-851 +/- 46 grams of CO2 equivalent emissions per square metre per year (gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1))). If fertilized, these communities have the capacity to produce about 63 +/- 5 gigajoules of ethanol energy per hectare per year. By contrast, an adjacent, no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotation produces on average 41 +/- 1 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year and has a net direct mitigation capacity of -397 +/- 32 gCO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1); a continuous corn rotation would probably produce about 62 +/- 7 gigajoules of biofuel energy per hectare per year, with 13% less mitigation. We also perform quantitative modelling of successional vegetation on marginal lands in the region at a resolution of 0.4 hectares, constrained by the requirement that each modelled location be within 80 kilometres of a potential biorefinery. Our results suggest that such vegetation could produce about 21 gigalitres of ethanol per year from around 11 million hectares, or approximately 25 per cent of the 2022 target for cellulosic biofuel mandated by the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with no initial carbon debt nor the indirect land-use costs associated with food-based biofuels. Other regional-scale aspects of biofuel sustainability(2), such as water quality(11,14) and biodiversity(15), await future study. nan;LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PART II; BIOFUELS; ETHANOL; CORN; AGRICULTURE; GRASSLANDS; DIVERSITY; EMISSIONS","Ethics and climate change: an introduction Climate ethics is an emerging field.

In Costa Rica, a pioneer national scheme of payment provides compensation for forest conservation that is assumed to jointly produce services related to biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, water and scenic beauty, but little is known about the spatial correlations among these services. A spatial assessment, at national scale and with fine resolution, identified the spatial congruence between these services, by considering the biophysical potential of service provision and socioeconomic demand. Services have different spatial distributions but are positively correlated. Spatial synergies exist between current policies (national parks and the payment scheme) and the conservation of ecosystem services: national parks and areas receiving payments provide more services than other areas. Biodiversity hotspots have the highest co-benefits for other services, while carbon hotspots have the lowest. This finding calls for cautiousness in relation to expectations that forest-based mitigation initiatives such as REDD (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) can automatically maximize bundled co-benefits for biodiversity and local ecosystem services. carbon; mitigation; climate change; REDD; spatial analysis; scenic beauty; environmental services; biodiversity; adaptation; water;ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CARBON STOCKS; PAYMENTS; FORESTS; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; BENEFITS; IMPACT; WORLDS","The impact on domestic CO2 emissions of domestic government-funded clean energy R & D and of spillovers from foreign government-funded clean energy R & D There is scientific consensus that the risk of catastrophic global warming can be avoided only if global CO2 emissions are dramatically reduced. To the extent that government-funded clean energy R & D in one country not only reduces CO2 emissions in that country but also lowers CO2 emissions in other countries through international spillovers, such R & D can play an important role in reducing this risk. Whether and how domestic and foreign government-funded clean energy R & D affect domestic CO2 emissions is thus an important research question, which, however, is largely unexplored. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine the effects of domestic and foreign government-funded clean energy R & D on domestic CO2 emissions. Specifically, we examine the role of environmental goods imports as a channel of international R & D spillovers. Using non -stationary panel techniques, we find in data from the G7 countries over the period 1994-2018 that both domestic and foreign government-funded clean energy R & D have measurable negative effects on domestic CO2 emissions and that spillovers from foreign government-funded clean energy R & D occur through imports of environmental goods. We conclude from our findings that government-funded clean energy R & D can indeed play a significant role in reducing the risk of catastrophic global warming. ","The value of informed agency for Torres Strait climate change The challenge of aggregating research information for Torres Strait exists. Currently, research is often done in isolation. Now, more than ever, the aggregation of Torres Strait research information is needed to address climate change. Information aggregation leads to informed agency. Informed agency leads to best possible climate change policies and actions. Information markets can facilitate informed agency and climate change project selection and valuation. We demonstrate the benefit of employing a particular information market approach to facilitate informing agents in a real world workshop setting. The workshop considers how best to address the Torres Strait climate change problem. Our a priori theoretical model motivates a specific hypothesis on the functional form of information uptake by agents (workshop participants). Analysis of collected data supports our hypothesis. The information market implies a valuation of climate change project information. It is estimated to be as valuable as a typical flood insurance premium.

Resilience is understood as the system's adaptive ability to maintain its functionality even when the system is being affected by a disturbance or shock; in WEF nexus systems, climate change impacts are considered disturbances/shocks and may affect the system in different ways, depending on its resilience. Future global challenges will severely affect all vital resources and threaten environmental resilience. In this article, we present a resilience analysis framework for a water-energy-food nexus system under climate change, and we identify how such systems can become more resilient with the implementation of policies. We showcase results in the national case study of Greece. Parametric sensitivity analysis for socioecological systems is performed to identify which parameter the model is the most sensitive to. The case study is based on the structure of a system dynamics model that maps sector-specific data from major national and international databases while causal loop diagrams and stock-and-flow diagrams are presented. Through engineering and ecological resilience metrics, we quantify system resilience and identify which policy renders the system more resilient in terms of how much perturbation it can absorb and how fast it bounces back to its original state, if at all. Two policies are tested, and the framework is implemented to identify which policy is the most beneficial for the system in terms of resilience. system resilience; engineering resilience; ecological resilience; sensitivity analysis; climate change; system dynamics modeling; causal loop diagrams; water-energy-food-climate nexus;RIVER-BASIN; SECURITY; DYNAMICS","Deforestation-Induced Fragmentation Increases Forest Fire Occurrence in Central Brazilian Amazonia Amazonia is home to more than half of the world's remaining tropical forests, playing a key role as reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity. However, whether at a slower or faster pace, continued deforestation causes forest fragmentation in this region. Thus, understanding the relationship between forest fragmentation and fire incidence and intensity in this region is critical. Here, we use MODIS Active Fire Product (MCD14ML, Collection 6) as a proxy of forest fire incidence and intensity (measured as Fire Radiative PowerFRP), and the Brazilian official Land-use and Land-cover Map to understand the relationship among deforestation, fragmentation, and forest fire on a deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazonia. Our results showed that forest fire incidence and intensity vary with levels of habitat loss and forest fragmentation. About 95% of active fires and the most intense ones (FRP > 500 megawatts) were found in the first kilometre from the edges in forest areas. Changes made in 2012 in the Brazilian main law regulating the conservation of forests within private properties reduced the obligation to recover illegally deforested areas, thus allowing for the maintenance of fragmented areas in the Brazilian Amazonia. Our results reinforce the need to guarantee low levels of fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazonia in order to avoid the degradation of its forests by fire and the related carbon emissions. remote sensing; MODIS; Amazonian forests; Brazilian Forest Code; edge effects;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND-USE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; DETECTION ALGORITHM; LOGGED FORESTS; RAIN-FOREST; MANAGEMENT; FEEDBACKS; EMISSIONS; DROUGHTS","Local observations of climate change and impacts on traditional food security in two northern Aboriginal communities Objectives. Our primary objective was to record participant observations of changes in the local environment, harvesting situations and traditional food species and to explore what impact these may have on traditional food. Study Design. A participatory study with 2 northern Aboriginal communities in Canada. Methods. Focus groups were conducted in both communities. Both specific and open-ended questions were asked, to gather information about the traditional food harvest and a qualitative analysis was conducted. Results. Members from both communities are witnessing variable changes in climate that are, affecting their traditional food harvest. New species and changes in migration of species being observed by community members have the potential to affect the consumption of traditional food, Similarly, changes in water levels in and around harvesting areas are affecting access to harvest areas, which in turn affects the traditional food harvest. Conclusions. Community members have been required to change their harvest mechanisms to, adapt to changes in climate and ensure an adequate supply of traditional food. A strong commitment to programs that will ensure the protection of traditional food systems is necessary. climate change; traditional food; aboriginal communities; food security;nan","Irrigation and Yield Parameters of Soybean as Effected by Irrigation Management, Soil Compaction and Nitrogen Fertilizationy Irrigation parameters (reference crop evapotranspiration, actual plant water use, amount of irrigation water, water use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency, plant water consumption coefficient, variations in soil moisture based on plant water consumption-amount of irrigation water) and yield parameters (seed yield, 1000-kernel weight, harvest index) were investigated for soybean grown in Harran Plain under conventional every-furrow and alternate-furrow irrigation management systems, three different compaction levels (control without compaction, low compaction, high compaction) and three different nitrogen levels (6, 9, 12 kg da(-1)). Experiments were carried out during 2006 and 2007 cropping seasons in Sanliurfa, Turkey in split-split plots experimental design with 3 replications. Irrigation program was created by KanSched simulation model. The amount of applied irrigation water in conventional and alternate furrow systems in 2006 and 2007 were measured as 435.61 and 291.59 mm, and 429.51 and 271.72 mm, respectively. ET values decreased with increasing compaction levels. The highest ET value (568 mm) was observed in non-compacted control treatment and the lowest value (240 mm) in high-compaction treatment. Irrigation water use efficiency increased with decreased irrigation water and the values were higher than water use efficiencies. While the highest yield (94.78 kg da(-1)) was observed in control treatment of the year 2006, conventional furrow system had the highest yield (209.93 kg da(-1)) in the year 2007. While effects of compaction and irrigation on harvest index were insignificant, nitrogen doses were found to be significant. Results revealed that KanSched irrigation model could be used for irrigation scheduling but plant coefficients to be used in the model should be determined properly based on climate conditions. Negative impacts of soil compaction in agricultural fields due to traffic and various other reasons can be eliminated with proper irrigation and fertilization implementations. However, yield losses at high-compaction levels may reach up to 45%.

This paper attempts to analyze the vulnerability of coastal areas of the Chittagong District in the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. This study explores the spatial variations of coastal vulnerability of the study area using three physical variables and four social variables with a spatial analytical method. In this regard, a Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI), and a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) have been prepared for the research area. Finally, a Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) was constructed within a geographic information system combining both PVI and CVI. The vulnerability indices reveal that the rural areas are more vulnerable to disaster than the urban areas. According to the PVI, SVI, and CVI about 66%, 48%, and 43% areas are highly vulnerable respectively. Despite of data limitations in constructing the PVI and SVI, this research is the first endeavor to apply a composite CVI based on geospatial techniques in the southeastern coast of Bangladesh. The CVI results illustrate that the coasts are the most vulnerable to flooding, storm surges and cyclones. In this study, CVI is presented as a tool to identify areas of vulnerability in the zones of the coastal district Chittagong. The CVI will serve as a practical guideline for policy makers to introduce policies and plans to mitigate the natural hazard-induced disaster impacts on the coastal Bangladesh.

It is now known that bills play an important thermoregulatory role, and recent studies revealed that temperature is positively associated with the size of bills relative to body size or weight in adult birds, in accordance with Allen's rule. Studies have attributed these patterns to local adaptation or an evolutionary response to climate change, but the contribution of ontogenetic plasticity remains unclear. We tested whether temperature experienced inside the nest predicted nestling growth in bill size and weight and in a parrot, the Adelaide rosella (Platycercus elegans adelaidae). We predicted that nest microclimate may affect bill ontogeny, leading to a positive association between relative bill size and temperatures during rearing. Growth in bill surface area was greater in nests that were warmer during the day and night, but temperature variability had no effect. Higher day and night-time mean temperatures, and less variable night-time temperatures, were positively associated with nestling weight. Our findings indicate that nest microclimate influences nestling growth, including relative bill size, and that daytime heat dissipation may be a driver of bill ontogeny. Bill plasticity in response to temperature during rearing could be an important but little studied contributor to morphology, due to the role of the bill in thermoregulation.

Global climate change is already having major impacts on Arctic ecosystems. Increasing temperatures and reductions in sea ice are particular conservation concerns for ice-associated species, including three endemic cetaceans that have evolved in or joined the Arctic sympagic community over the last 5 M years. Sea ice losses are also a major stimulant to increased industrial interest in the Arctic in previously ice-covered areas. The impacts of climate change are expected to continue and will likely intensify in coming decades. This paper summarizes information on the distribution and movement patterns of the three ice-associated cetacean species that reside year-round in the Arctic, the narwhal (Monodon monoceros), beluga (white whale, Delphinapterus leucas), and bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus). It maps their current distribution and identifies areas of seasonal aggregation, particularly focussing on high-density occurrences during the summer. Sites of oil and gas exploration and development and routes used for commercial shipping in the Arctic are compared with the distribution patterns of the whales, with the aim of highlighting areas of special concern for conservation. Measures that should be considered to mitigate the impacts of human activities on these Arctic whales and the aboriginal people who depend on them for subsistence include: careful planning of ship traffic lanes (re-routing if necessary) and ship speed restrictions; temporal or spatial closures of specified areas (e.g. where critical processes for whales such as calving, calf rearing, resting, or intense feeding take place) to specific types of industrial activity; strict regulation of seismic surveys and other sources of loud underwater noise; and close and sustained monitoring of whale populations in order to track their responses to environmental disturbance.

PLANTS UNDER HIGH CO2 CONCENTRATION AND DROUGHT STRESS This study aims to evaluate the leaf concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus correlated to the production of photoassimilates in beans plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under high [CO2] and drought stress. The experiment was conducted in Vicosa (Brazil), during the period from April to July 2009, by using open-top chambers equipped with CO2 injection system. The drought stress was applied, through the irrigation suspension, during the period from flowering to maturation. The experimental design was randomized blocks in split-plot scheme with four replication, where the plots with plants grown in [CO2] of 700 mg L-1 and [CO2] environment of 380 mg L-1 and the subplots with plants with and without drought stress. The results were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0.05). In the plants under high [CO2] with and without drought stress, the photosynthetic rate increased by 59%, while the dry matter presented an increment of 20% in the plants under high [CO2] without drought stress. Reductions in [N] and [P] occurred in plants grown under high [CO2], resulting in greater efficiency in nitrogen use for photosynthesis. The high [CO2] increase only the total dry matter and not the total mass of grains. The drought stress reduces the dry matter and mass of grain, even at high [CO2]. beans; mineral nutrition; photosynthesis; climatic changes;ELEVATED CARBON-DIOXIDE; PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACCLIMATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YIELD; RESPONSES; ENRICHMENT; IMPACT; FACE; UK","Geospatial modelling of tropical cyclone risks to the southern Oman coasts Tropical cyclones are among the most destructive natural phenomena in the world. The effects of cyclones on coastal areas include the loss of lives, property damage, and infrastructure destruction. As a cyclone-prone area, Dhofar Governorate in Oman is regularly hit by tropical cyclones, of which the last was Mekunu in May 2018. In southern Oman, a vast majority of the population and infrastructure is concentrated along the coast of the Arabian Sea, and an explicit spatial assessment is essential to create the maps of risk indices and to identify the areas of relative high cyclone risks. In this research, we aimed to develop a geospatial modelling approach to quantify the spatial variations of cyclone risk impacts across all the administrative zones of Dhofar Governorate. Three major components, namely vulnerability and exposure, hazard, and mitigation, consisting of 14 spatial criteria were incorporated in the analysis at the local scale. A spatial layer was generated for each criterion as well as a calculated weighted score using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) overlay techniques. An individual map for each risk component was produced, and the risk index was calculated on the basis of the vulnerability, hazard, and capacity indices. The findings indicated that vulnerable populations and highly exposed areas to severe cyclone impacts were distributed along the coastlines of the southern (Salalah, Taqah, and Mirbat) and southwest (Rakhyut and Dalkut) wilayats. The present study has potential and valuable policy implications for planners and decision makers, as well as serves as a robust baseline for developing national risk mitigation strategies which aim to diminish and absorb cyclone disaster impacts.

Here, we explored how protected areas affected land cover volatility in China from 2011 to 2020 with LandTrendr using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform by comparing the difference in volatility of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in protected and unprotected areas. The results show that the regions with frequent land cover volatility are mainly located in eastern, central, and southwestern China, indicating that land cover volatility with high NDVI loss values is spatially aggregated in most cases. Considering the impact of protected areas, land cover volatility is relatively consistent inside and outside the protected area throughout the study period, showing a trend of first fluctuating and then rising. Approximately 22% of detected land cover volatility occurred in protected areas, though the average NDVI loss value (0.56) for protected areas was greater than unprotected areas (0.51). Combined with the outliers, land cover volatility accompanied by larger NDVI loss values is still primarily distributed in unprotected areas in most years. The detection of NDVI gain values in protected areas shows that protected areas (average value is 0.48) are larger than unprotected areas (average value is 0.47) almost every year, even combined with the outliers, and land cover volatility accompanied by larger NDVI gain values is also primarily distributed in protected areas in most years. Elucidating land cover volatility is helpful in understanding land cover changes and how to formulate an effective land use policy. land use/cover change; unprotected area; GEE; China;SPECTRAL INDEXES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RIVER-BASIN; SEVERITY; PATTERNS; FOREST; CITY","Evolution of the dry-wet variations since 1834 CE in the Liiliang Mountains, north China and its relationship with the Asian summer monsoon Under the background of global climate change, arid to semi-humid areas are more vulnerable to extreme climate, such as floods and droughts. To better predict and cope with future climate change, more local and regional long-term high-resolution climate reconstructions, hydroclimate in particular, are required. Based on a 174-year regional tree-ring-width chronology, we reconstructed the February-June Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI26) history in the Luliang Mountains, North China (NC). Reconstructed SPEI26 is expected to reflect the dry-wet variation from spring to early summer (STES) of NC with an explained variance of 43.8% for the instrumental record (1951-2007 CE). The reconstruction reveals three comparatively dry (1857-1878, 1919-1929 and 1995-2001 CE) and four comparatively wet (1883-1895, 1934-1944, 1952-1961 and 1980-1984 CE) periods during 1834-2007 CE. Although a drying trend is seen since the 1950s, an advent of wetting since the end of the 1990s is expected. As the driest period in the reconstruction, 1919-1929 CE records the widespread catastrophic 1920s drought in northern China. In addition to the local hydroclimatic signal, the reconstruction also reflects hydroclimatic variation over a large portion of northern China, which is evidented by the comparison with other hydroclimatic records and regional dry-wet index. Strength of the Indian summer monsoon and the East Asian summer monsoon in the previous year play vital roles in the STES dry-wet variations. Moreover, Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation index influents the hydroclimate in NC by influencing the Asian summer monsoon system.

Recent models and observations of global ice sheets and their contributions to sea level, as well as climate models, suggest that significant sea level acceleration is imminent, yet observational data from tide gauges and satellites have not yet found rates consistent with some of the projections. To allow coastal planners a way to incorporate the uncertainties of acceleration, a synthesis of observed sea level data with selected distributions of acceleration and the current rate of rise is proposed to provide probabilistic estimates of future sea levels. The resulting distributions can be adopted in a risk-based framework to assess project vulnerability.

Geostationary satellites data cover the gaps in the radar network prior to the formation of the precipitation for the storms and their environment. The study explores the effects of assimilating the water vapor channel radiances from Himawari-8 data with Weather Research and Forecasting model data assimilation system (WRFDA) for a severe storm case over north China. A fast cloud detection scheme for Advanced Himawari imager (AHI) radiance is enhanced in the framework of the WRFDA system initially in this study. The bias corrections, the cloud detection for the clear-sky AHI radiance, and the observation error modeling for cloudy radiance are conducted before the data assimilation. All AHI radiance observations are fully applied without any quality control for all-sky AHI radiance data assimilation. Results show that the simulated all-sky AHI radiance fits the observations better by using the cloud dependent observation error model, further improving the cloud heights. The all-sky AHI radiance assimilation adjusts all types of hydrometeor variables, especially cloud water and precipitation snow. It is proven that assimilating all-sky AHI data improves hydrometeor specifications when verified against the radar reflectivity. Consequently, the assimilation of AHI observations under the all-sky condition has an overall improved impact on both the precipitation locations and intensity compared to the experiment with only conventional and AHI clear-sky radiance data.

Here we undertake the first comprehensive examination of the potential impact of global climate change on armed conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. We find strong historical linkages between civil war and temperature in Africa, with warmer years leading to significant increases in the likelihood of war. When combined with climate model projections of future temperature trends, this historical response to temperature suggests a roughly 54% increase in armed conflict incidence by 2030, or an additional 393,000 battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars. Our results suggest an urgent need to reform African governments' and foreign aid donors' policies to deal with rising temperatures. civil conflict; climate change;CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONFLICT; TRENDS","Ecological modernisation and climate change in Australia Ecological modernisation (EM), in both theory and practice, has much to commend it. Its main strengths lie in its promotion of win-win solutions to ecological risk and its utilisation of the very institutions of modernisation to foster industrial and ecological adaptation. EM is usefully conceptualised into its weak and strong forms, with distinctions also drawn between ecological modernisation and ecological restructuring, but even weak ecological modernisation may trigger ecological restructuring. Governments, particularly those governing energy-intensive economies, are increasingly caught up in this dynamic, to which they respond in different ways. A critical EM framework is used as a lens through which to consider Australia's climate policy, focusing on the sectoral politics that shape its modernisation-restructuring dynamic. ecological modernisation; climate change; Australian climate policy;nan","From rapid coastal collapse to slow sedimentary recovery: The morphological ups and downs of the modern Po Delta As is the case with many deltas in the world, the Po Delta (Italy) and its barrier systems have experienced severe modifications over the last century as a consequence of anthropogenic subsidence and river input decrease. The interruption of subsurface fluid withdrawals in the early 1960s created an opportunity to evaluate the effects of the subsequent subsidence decrease along the 11 km of beaches and 45 km of barrier islands of the Po Delta, and improve the understanding of coastal system response to relative sea level rise. To this aim, shoreline and bathymetric multi-decadal dataset were coupled with the local rate of subsidence and classified with a geomorphic - response approach. From 1954-78, a mean shoreline variation of -224 m (-9.34 m y-1) occurred under high rates of subsidence (14-43 mm y-1) with a diffuse process of landward barrier rollover (up to 1124 m), frequently associated with break-up. This phase is evidenced by the diffuse sinking of the shoreface (up to 4 m), the negative upper shoreface sediment budget and the parallel drowning of the cross-shore profiles highlighted by the 1968-2008 bathymetric dataset. Despite the loss of altimetry and shoreline retreat being almost irrecoverable, during the period from 1978 to 1996 and 1996 to 2014 barrier islands experienced a stabilisation in response to a decrease in the subsidence rates down to 6 mm y-1. The mean rates of shoreline changes (-0.25 and + 1.51 m y-1 respectively) are the results of different local behaviour with progressively dominant longshore processes and progradation at the most active fluvial branches. The most recent bathymetric data (2008-2014) confirm this reversal trend, both in the altimetry differences and in the upper shoreface sediment budget. This trend is at odds with signals from many of the world's deltas and represents an important issue for the present and future coastal management and adaptation plans.

Building on these debates, this article, and the Special Issue on Climate Mobilities: Migration, im/mobilities and mobilities regimes in a changing climate that it introduces, conceptualises this relation in terms of climate mobilities. Through the concept of climate mobilities, we highlight the multiplicity of mobility in the context of a changing climate, including the interrelations between human mobilities and immobilities and their interplay with other mobile flows, such as the mobilities of ideas, information, or climate risk. We furthermore delve into the politics of climate mobilities, defining climate mobility regimes, and implications for mobility justice among those whose mobility is impacted by these regimes. We argue for research to pay more attention to acts of resistance against dominant climate mobility regimes, including voluntary immobilities and re-emplacements that challenge mass migration frames or imposed relocation policies. The articles in this issue empirically examine these dimensions, reflecting on the plurality of climate mobilities and its politics, each analysing how these evolve in a situated cultural or political context.

Scientists and managers involved strive to create learning that advances science in various fields while providing benefits for society. They also face challenges of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) for accountability and measurement of impacts, required by funding agencies. In this paper we tested selected M&E processes and methods for their potential to increase capacity in a cross-cultural inter-disciplinary research setting of an urban water research project. A total of eight different qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods were assessed using two processes: self-evaluation by researchers, testing five methods; and the external evaluations by stakeholders, testing three methods. Both processes were found useful. Of the five self-evaluation methods tested, the Logical Frameworks method was deemed a good planning tool but not one contributing to learning. The qualitative (Factors of Success and Obstacles/Enablers) and the Best Case/Worst Case Scenarios quantitative method were effective learning methods. Tracking Change was found suitable for measuring learning. We recommended that a combination of methods be used in order to capture the full dynamic of projects in various stages. Explicit timelines for indicators and measures of project success are recommended for managing expectations of both researchers and funding agencies.

External pressures related to environmental protection, commodity prices, energy availability, larger populations, and climate change have combined to require an immediate and substantial improvement in agricultural irrigation performance. Worldwide progression towards modernized irrigation projects has been uneven and slower than desired, but decades of irrigation modernization development have clarified certain requirements for success, as well as illuminated indicators of project failure. Of particular importance are required shifts within the state and national irrigation bureaucracies, as well as universities. Copyright ","Publishing trends on climate change vulnerability in the conservation literature reveal a predominant focus on direct impacts and long time-scales Over the past twelve years the number of papers that explore the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the conservation literature has grown on average by 20% annually. By categorising these papers on their primary research questions, we show that the vast majority of these articles (88.6%) focus only on those impacts that arise directly as a result of climate change, ignoring the potentially significant indirect threats that arise from human adaptation responses. This pattern has remained fairly consistent throughout the review period (2000-2012), with a trend towards more articles considering both direct and indirect impacts towards the end of the period. We also find a bias in the time-frames considered by published articles that project future impacts of climate change on biodiversity, with more than three-quarters (77.9%) of papers only considering impacts after 2031, and almost half (49.1%) only considering impacts after 2051. This focus on long-term, direct impacts creates a mismatch, not only with the life-cycles of species and timescales of many ecological processes, but also with most management and policy timelines and the short-term nature of human decision making processes. The focus on studying the long-term, direct impacts of climate change on biodiversity is likely a function of the lack of availability of climate projections on shorter temporal scales; a perception that short-term impacts will be minor; and, insufficient integration with the social and political sciences. While the direct impact of changes in mean climatic conditions will significantly change the biosphere by the end of the century, near term changes in seasonality and extreme events coupled with human adaptation responses are likely to have substantial impacts much sooner, threatening the survival of species and ecosystems. It is therefore essential that we balance our research efforts to facilitate a better understanding of these more imminent threats.

Many studies have demonstrated the positive impact of vegetation cover on the ratio of transpiration (T) to ET. Whether it is universally true with regard to different vegetation types and different sites is understudied. In this study, five sites in Northern China with different vegetation types were selected for comparison study.ET partitioning is conducted using an approach based on the concept of the underlying water use efficiency with eddy covariance measurements. The results show various patterns of vegetation's effects over ET partitioning and, when compared with existing studies, also reveal a new relationship between the T/ET ratio and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at some of the sites. At the alpine meadow site, the T/ET ratio gradually increase when NDVI is low and rapidly increase as NDVI go beyond a certain value, whereas at the arid shrub site, the T/ET ratio rapidly increase when NDVI is low and plateaus at a certain value when NDVI reaches a relatively high value. In deciduous forest, the T/ET ratio becomes unresponsive to NDVI beyond a threshold value. This study also reveals that irrigation schemes play a major role in determining the correlation between the T/ET ratio and NDVI because the T/ET ratio becomes well correlated with NDVI in case of flood irrigation and irrelevant to NDVI in the case of mulch drip irrigation. Furthermore, this study helps us to understand ET partitioning under different sites and different human activities such as irrigation. These findings can help policymakers to better understand the connection between vegetation and climate change or human activities and provide significant information for water management policy.

The change of land use and land cover (LULC) has considerable impacts on island ecosystems, and there is a critical need for a free and open-source tool for detecting land cover fluctuations and spatial distribution. This study used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to explore land cover classification and the spatial pattern of major land cover change from 1990 to 2019 on Haitan Island, China. The land cover classification was performed using multiple spectral bands (RGB, NIR, SWIR), vegetation indices (NDVI, NDBI, MNDWI), and tasseled cap transformation of Landsat images based on the random forest supervised algorithm. The major land cover conversion processes (transfer to and from) between 1990 and 2019 were analyzed in detail for the years of 1990, 2000, 2007, and 2019, and the overall accuracies ranged from 88.43% to 91.08%, while the Kappa coefficients varied from 0.86 to 0.90. During 1990-2019, other land, cultivated land, sandy land, and water area decreased by 30.70%, 13.63%, 3.76%, and 0.95%, respectively, while forest and built-up land increased by 30.94% and 16.20% of the study area, respectively. The predominant land cover was other land (34.49%) and cultivated land (26.80%) in 1990, which transitioned to forest land (53.57%) and built-up land (23.07%) in 2019. Reforestation, cultivated land reduction, and built-up land expansion were the major land cover change processes on Haitan Island. The spatial pattern of forest, cultivated land, and built-up land change is mainly explained by the implementation of a 'Grain for Green Project' and 'Comprehensive Pilot Zone' policy on Haitan Island. Policy and human activities are the major drivers for land use change, including reforestation, population growth, and economic development. This study is unique because it demonstrates the use of GEE for continuous monitoring of the impact of reforestation efforts and urbanization in an island environment. anthropogenic activities; forest change; GEE; LULC; urbanization;TIME-SERIES; FOREST DISTURBANCE; DERIVATION; DYNAMICS; IMAGES; CHINA","Impacts of Vegetation Changes on Land Evapotranspiration in China During 1982-2015 Evapotranspiration (ET) bridges the hydrological and energy cycle through vegetation transpiration (T), soil evaporation (ES), and canopy interception evaporation (EI). Transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) quantifies the water use efficiency of terrestrial ecosystems explaining the mechanism of vegetation water transport and water-carbon interactions. This study employed GIMMS LAI3g data to improve the CLM4.5 land surface scheme of RegCM4.6. We designed two simulation experiments, each with control (CTL) and sensitivity (SEN), simulating the interannual variability of vegetation on ET and T/ET in China from 1982 to 2015. Studies show China has experienced a greening trend, especially in mid-south China and South China. Leaf area index (LAI) increased significantly (0.002 m(2)m(-2)yr(-1)). increment LAI (SEN input LAI data minus CTL input LAI data) and increment T/ET (T/ET data output by SEN minus T/ET data output by CTL) have shown significant positive correlations. The impacts of LAI on T/ET are more prominent during spring and winter than in autumn and summer. Compared with T/ET and LAI (R = 0.70), the correlation between ET and LAI is moderate (R < 0.5), indicating that vegetation has a higher impact on T/ET than ET. The impact of vegetation anomalies (positive and negative LAI anomalies) on T/ET and ET is spatially different, mainly due to dominant factors affecting ET and T/ET changes. In spring, summer, and autumn, &T (transpiration changes corresponding to vegetation anomalies) is the leading factor affecting both ET and T/ET regionally, and &T has a stronger influence on T/ET than ET, especially in summer. Vegetation anomalies have a stronger influence on T/ET than ET; and the influence of positive vegetation anomalies on ET and T/ET is greater than that of negative vegetation anomalies, especially in spring and autumn. This study reveals the mechanisms behind vegetation processes and their influences on the water and heat fluxes at the land-atmosphere interface and provides a strong scientific basis for studying the water cycle under climate warming. evapotranspiration; transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio; leaf area index; RegCM4; 6; CLM4; 5;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; HEIHE RIVER-BASIN; TIBETAN PLATEAU; CARBON-DIOXIDE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PAN EVAPORATION; TREND ANALYSIS; SOIL-MOISTURE; RISING CO2; TRANSPIRATION","Determinants of Farmers' Awareness and Adoption of Extension Recommended Wheat Varieties in the Rainfed Areas of Pakistan Scientific evidence suggests that there is room for eradicating poverty and hunger by increasing food production through the adoption of modern agricultural practices by farmers. This study aimed, first, to explore the relationship between the farmers' awareness and adoption of improved wheat varieties. Second, it aimed to find the key factors that govern the farmers' awareness and adoption of extension-recommended innovations in the rainfed cropping system of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Data were collected from 395 respondents. A binary logit model was used to analyze the effect of the farmers' socioeconomic and farm-specific characteristics on their awareness and adoption of the extension-suggested wheat varieties. Moreover, qualitative data from 40 key informants were collected for in-depth analysis. The results show a strong association between the farmers' awareness of a technology (improved wheat varieties) and its adoption. The results of the logit model show that their extension contacts, income from agriculture, and access to credit positively affected the farmers' awareness, whereas their education and household sizes negatively affected their awareness. Moreover, the factors that positively influenced the farmers' decision to adopt the technology included the extension contact, the confidence in the extension, the risk-bearing attitude, and the credit access, whereas the household size and education negatively affected it. The results of the key informant interviews reveal that the high incidence of poverty, the low soil fertility, the farmers' inability to make effective decisions, the lack of accurate weather predictability in the rainfed farming system, the lack of government interest, and the asymmetric information in the inputs markets contributed to the farmers' low levels of awareness and to their poor adoption of improved agricultural technologies. These results indicate that any intervention aimed at the awareness and adoption by farmers of improved technologies, such as new wheat varieties, should recognize the heterogeneity in the farmers' socioeconomic and farm-specific characteristics. farmers' awareness; technology adoption; improved wheat varieties; socioeconomic and farm-specific characteristics;AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION; SMALLHOLDER FARMERS; CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE; RICE PRODUCTION; SOIL FERTILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; RISK; INNOVATIONS; PROVINCE","Public opinion on climate change: Belief and concern, issue salience and support for government action Climate policy across the developed world remains inadequate, despite high levels of concern about climate change among the public. Yet public opinion on climate change is complex, with individuals differing on three key opinion dimensions: belief and concern, issue salience, and support for government action. In this study, we investigate how these dimensions intersect at the individual level. Based on data from an online survey conducted in 2018 in the United Kingdom (N = 787), a latent class analysis reveals that there are five climate change opinion publics. The two largest publics have strong beliefs that climate change is occurring, but view it as a low salience issue, or are wary of government action to address it. We also investigate sociopolitical covariates of each public. By providing a detailed picture of climate change views, these findings can help us to better understand the relationship between public opinion and climate policy. climate change; issue salience; public opinion; United Kingdom;CHANGE PERCEPTIONS; ATTITUDES; SKEPTICISM; IMPACT; POLICY; UK; DETERMINANTS; ORIENTATION; ADAPTATION; DOMINANCE","Levels and determinants of vulnerability of two indigenous communities in the Philippines Implications from using mixed-methods approach Purpose - This paper aims to determine and compare the vulnerability of selected indigenous communities in the Philippines using several integrated index development approaches. Better understanding on how negative impacts of climate change could be effectively reduced is the identification of appropriate vulnerability assessment approach that is applicable to the local and cultural contexts. Critical in the case of indigenous communities is the analyses of determinants of vulnerability by and with themselves. Design/methodology/approach - Using the survey data of combined 169 households, vulnerability scores of two adjacent Alangan Mangyan indigenous communities were quantified utilizing a set of 31 indicators that were systematically combined via the balanced-weighted (composite index) and unbalanced-weighted (principal component analysis) approaches. Findings - The computed vulnerability scores of the Alangan Mangyan communities using several approaches yielded varying results. In both study sites, the degree of vulnerability is differentiated even among households of indigenous communities of comparable socio-economic characteristics. The developed indices confirm that typhoons, level of education, literacy rate and monthly income were found to have direct effect on the Alangan Mangyan communities' vulnerability. Originality/value - The study has successfully tested various methodological frameworks in implementing vulnerability assessment applicable in the context of indigenous communities in the Philippines. Results highlighted the need to simultaneously implement several vulnerability assessment approaches to allow comparison of results instead of solely basing climate change vulnerability-reduction programs to be implemented to a single assessment approach.

Assessing the performance of polycentric energy and climate governance networks Polycentric governance networks are on the rise in global energy and climate governance, but we know surprisingly little about their empirical performance. This paper analyzes the performance of four such transnational energy and climate governance networks. In the realm of sustainable energy, our cases are the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP) and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC). In the climate sphere, we examine the effectiveness of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the Clinton Climate Initiative (CCI). Using principles from governance and public administration about the effectiveness of institutions, we examine the extent to which four networks have contributed to improving governance outcomes in the spheres of climate and sustainable energy. Our evaluation focuses on the clarity of purpose, funding, institutional formality, efficacy, and level of resilience of these networks. Some differences notwithstanding, we find that the transnational governance networks generally fail to meet the criteria about what constitutes an effective institution. The paper concludes with a reflection on what could be done to enhance the performance of these governance networks. ","Temporal and spatial variations of high-impact weather events in China during 1959-2014 The variation and trend in the frequency and duration of four types of high-impact weather (HIW) events were examined using daily surface climate data and linear regression method, and results show that for both the frequency and the duration, the trends of hot weather events were not significant in most parts of China, though for the China as a whole, they had increased with rates of 0.4 days and 0.1 spells of hot weather per decade respectively. The frequency of cold weather events had decreased significantly in most parts of China, particularly in northern, northeastern, and western China, where it increased at rates of 2-8 days per decade in most stations, but the duration of cold weather events were not significant in most parts of China. The frequency of gale weather events had decreased in almost all of China, with a rate of 3.7 days per decade for the China as a whole, and the duration of gale weather events had decreased mainly in northeastern and northern China, western Xinjiang, southwestern Sichuan, and some coastal areas of Liaoning, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Fujian. The frequency of rainstorm weather events was not significant in most parts of China, and the duration of rainstorm weather events was not significant in the whole of China. With global climate change, there would be an increase in the hot and rainstorm weather events, so mitigation/adaptation strategies for such weather events are essential for local government and social public. nan;EXTREME RAINFALL EVENTS; TEMPERATURE EXTREMES; DAILY PRECIPITATION; AIR-TEMPERATURE; TRENDS; PROJECTION","High developmental temperature leads to low reproduction despite adult temperature Phenotypic plasticity can help organisms cope with changing thermal conditions and it may depend on which life-stage the thermal stress is imposed: for instance, exposure to stressful temperatures during development can trigger a positive plastic response in adults. Here, we analyze the thermal plastic response of laboratory populations of Drosophila subobscura, derived from two contrasting latitudes of the European dine. We measured reproductive performance through fecundity characters, after the experimental populations were exposed to five thermal treatments, with different combinations of developmental and adult temperatures (14 degrees C, 18 degrees C, or 26 degrees C). Our questions were whether (1) adult performance changes with exposure to higher (or lower) temperatures during development; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures outperform those developed at higher ones, supporting the ""colder is better"" hypothesis; (3) there is a cumulative effect on adult performance of exposing both juveniles and adults to higher (or lower) temperatures; (4) there is evidence for biogeographical effects on adult performance. Our main findings were that (1) higher developmental temperatures led to low reproductive performance regardless of adult temperature, while at lower temperatures reduced performance only occurred when colder conditions were persistent across juvenile and adult stages; (2) flies raised at lower temperatures did not always outperform those developed at other temperatures; (3) there were no harmful cumulative effects after exposing both juveniles and adults to higher temperatures; (4) both latitudinal populations showed similar thermal plasticity patterns. The negative effect of high developmental temperature on reproductive performance, regardless of adult temperature, highlights the developmental stage as very critical and most vulnerable to climate change and associated heat waves.

Recently, the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal, i.e., Phylin and Hudhud in Andhra Pradesh coast, and the devastating impact of the 2004 tsunami in India increased the significance in assessing the vulnerability of the coastal lands to inundation and flooding, notably in the context of climate change-induced sea level rise. This study aims to estimate a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) for the coastal subregion of Krishna-Godavari delta and to use the calculated index to evaluate the vulnerability of 14 coastal talukas of the Krishna-Godavari delta region. This CVI is calculated by using four geological and three physical parameters characterizing the vulnerability of the study coastal region, including regional slope, coastal elevation, geomorphology, significant wave height, mean tidal range and relative sea level using different conventional and remotely sensed data. Using a composite coastal vulnerability index based on the relative risk rating of those parameters, each of the 14 coastal talukas was classified according to their vulnerability. The CVI results depict that coasts are least and most vulnerable to inundation, flooding and erosion of coastal lands where geological parameters are more efficient to CVI. The paper alerts to decision makers and planners to mitigate the natural disaster and manage the coastal zone and is a primary step toward prioritizing coastal lands for climate change adaptation strategies in the view of increased storminess and projected sea level rise.

A building's facade, as a part of the enclosure, is certainly no exception to this requirement; however, despite the significant potential for building energy savings and reduction of environmental impacts, building facade design is not receiving proper attention. Presently, there is a need for a systematic approach to facilitate the integration of the various disciplines involved (e.g. architecture, as well as structural, mechanical and electrical design) and provide a comprehensive action plan that considers the life cycle stages of a facade system from conceptual design to demolition. This paper initially provides the required actions and considerations in each phase of design to provide a new and simplified guideline for designers in achieving a high performance facade system, with the help of Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) methods. Secondly, the application of the Choquet integral and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is discussed to select the most suitable alternatives in facade preliminary design for a case study building, and the results are compared.

In this study, we evaluated the spatial heterogeneity of physicochemical parameters, soil bacterial diversity and metabolic adaptation at meter scale. Soil samples were collected from two quadrats of a desert (Thar Desert, India) with a hot, arid climate, very little rainfall and extreme temperatures. Analysis of physico-chemical parameters and subsequent variance analysis (p-values < 0.05) revealed that sulfate, potassium and magnesium ions were the most variable between the quadrats. Microbial diversity of the two quadrats was studied using Illumina bar-coded sequencing by targeting V3-V4 regions of 16S rDNA. As for the results, 702504 high-quality sequence reads, assigned to 173 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level, were examined. The most abundant phyla in both quadrats were Actinobacteria (38.72%), Proteobacteria (32.94%), and Acidobacteria (9.24%). At genus level, Gaiella represented highest prevalence, followed by Streptomyces, Solirubrobacter, Aciditerrimonas, Geminicoccus, Geodermatophilus, Microvirga, and Rubrobacter. Between the quadrats, significant difference (p-values < 0.05) was found in the abundance of Aciditerrimonas, Geodermatophilus, Geminicoccus, Ilumatobacter, Marmoricola, Nakamurella, and Solirubrobacter. Metabolic functional mapping revealed diverse biological activities, and was significantly correlated with physicochemical parameters. The results revealed spatial variation of ions, microbial abundance and functional attributes in the studied quadrats, and patchy nature in local scale. Interestingly, abundance of the biotechnologically important phylum Actinobacteria, with large proposition of unclassified species in the desert, suggested that this arid environment is a promising site for bioprospection.

With ongoing global urbanization and climate change, the light pollution status in global PAs deserves attention for mitigation and adaptation. In this study, we developed a framework to evaluate the light pollution status in global PAs, using the global NTL time series data. First, we classified global PAs (30,624) into three pollution categories: non-polluted (5974), continuously polluted (8141), and discontinuously polluted (16,509), according to the time of occurrence of lit pixels in/around PAs from 1992 to 2018. Then, we explored the NTL intensity (e.g., digital numbers) and its trend in those polluted PAs and identified those hotspots of PAs at the global scale with consideration of global urbanization. Our study shows that global light pollution is mainly distributed within the range of 30 degrees N and 60 degrees N, including Europe, north America, and East Asia. Although the temporal trend of NTL intensity in global PAs is increasing, Japan and the United States of America (USA) have opposite trends due to the implementation of well-planned ecological conservation policies and declining population growth. For most polluted PAs, the lit pixels are close to their boundaries (i.e., less than 10 km), and the NTL in/around these lit areas has become stronger over the past decades. The identified hotspots of PAs (e.g., Europe, the USA, and East Asia) help support decisions on global biodiversity conservation, particularly with global urbanization and climate change. nighttime light; urban sprawl; nighttime light intensity; biodiversity conservation;ANNUAL URBAN-DYNAMICS; ARTIFICIAL-LIGHT; TIME-SERIES; NIGHT; IMPACT; BEHAVIOR; RECORD; EXTENT","Key themes in the Working Group II contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 5th assessment report Assessments conducted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are significant undertakings that require input from experts and practitioners in multiple scientific disciplines, integrating local to international information across spatial and temporal scales. An IPCC report is a unique collaboration between the scientific community and policymakers, with governments (through their Focal Points) providing guidance and input to the scientists conducting an assessment at several stages during the process. This commentary reviews the IPCC mandate and process; summarizes key themes to be addressed in the Working Group II contribution to the 5th assessment report; discusses challenges for the WGII report when assessing qualitative literature, incorporating local knowledge, and identifying particularly vulnerable groups; and touches on the expertise and commitment of the WGII authors. Active engagement of the wider scientific community in IPCC assessments through publication and review will enhance their relevance to decision- and policy-makers. nan;nan","Clean Air, Smart Cities, Healthy Hearts: Action on Air Pollution for Cardiovascular Health More than twenty percent of all cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths are caused by air pollution - more than three million deaths every year - and these numbers will continue to rise unless the global community takes action. Nine out of ten people worldwide breathe polluted air, which disproportionately affects those living in low-resource settings. The World Heart Federation (WHF) is committed to reducing the impact of air pollution on people's health and has made this a priority area of its global advocacy efforts. In pursuit of this goal, WHF has formed an Air Pollution Expert Group to inform action on air pollution for CVD health and recommend changes to public health policy. This policy paper lays out the health impacts of air pollution, examines its position on the global policy agenda, demonstrates its relevance to the cardiovascular community, and proposes actionable policy measures to mitigate this deadly risk factor to health. The paper considers the important roles to be played by the Members of WHF, including scientific societies and the physicians that constitute them, heart health foundations, and patient advocacy groups.

Methods: We evaluated individual and area-level factors as modifiers of the association between warm-season (May-Sept.) temperature and pediatric respiratory morbidity in Atlanta. Emergency department (ED) visit data were obtained for children, 5-18 years old, with primary diagnoses of asthma or respiratory disease (diagnoses of upper respiratory infections, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or wheeze) in 20-county Atlanta during 1993-2012. Daily maximum temperature (Tmax) was acquired from the automated surface observing station at Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. Poisson generalized linear models were used to estimate rate ratios (RR) between daily Tmax and asthma or respiratory disease ED visits, controlling for time and meteorology. Tmax effects were estimated for single-day lags of 0-6 days, for 3-, 5-, and 7-day moving averages and modeled with cubic terms to allow for non-linear relationships. Effect modification by individual factors (sex, race, insurance status) and area-level socioeconomic status (SES; ZIP code levels of poverty, education, and the neighborhood deprivation index) was examined via stratification. Results: Estimated RRs for Tmax and pediatric asthma ED visits were positive and significant for lag days 1-5, with the strongest single day association observed on lag day 2 (RR = 1.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09) for a change in Tmax from 27 degrees C to 32 degrees C (25th to 75th percentile). For the moving average exposure periods, associations increased as moving average periods increased. We observed stronger RRs between Tmax and asthma among males compared to females, non-white children compared to white children, children with private insurance compared to children with Medicaid, and among children living in high compared to low SES areas. Associations between Tmax and respiratory disease ED visits were weak and non-significant (p-value > 0.05). Conclusions: Results suggest socio-demographic factors (race/ethnicity, insurance status, and area-level SES) may confer vulnerability to temperature-related pediatric asthma morbidity. Our findings of weaker associations among children with Medicaid compared to other health insurance types and among children living in low compared to high SES areas run counter to our belief that children from disadvantaged households or ZIP codes would be more vulnerable to the respiratory effects of temperature. The potential reasons for these unexpected results are explored in the discussion.

Interviews with farmers, policymakers and members of civil society organizations about the challenges and opportunities that agroforestry faces, as well as field visits to agroforestry projects revealed a wide range of agroforestry initiatives in Bolivia that provide ecosystem services, food and income to local families. All interviewees attributed a high potential to agroforestry, for example, to promote biodiversity, water conservation, food sovereignty and adaptation to climate change impacts. However, agroforestry initiatives lacked support because government incentives were channelled to cattle rearing and large-scale monocultures rather than diversified farming systems, and agroforestry initiatives tended to be small and isolated. A nationwide policy is needed which is coordinated with civil society organizations and individual farmers and strategically and efficiently supports agroforestry initiatives-especially in the most vulnerable first years of establishment-through extension services and access to materials, markets, knowledge and financial resources. agroforestry; Bolivia; diversified farming systems; food security; food sovereignty;CROP DIVERSITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; LANDSCAPES; MANAGEMENT; KNOWLEDGE; LAND","Effect of increasing temperature on yield of some winter crops in northwest India The effect of increase in temperature on grain yield of some winter crops (wheat, mustard, barley and chickpea) in northwest India was evaluated on the basis of historic records and through a dynamic crop growth model, WTGROWS. The optimal date of sowing was also evaluated in view of the increase in seasonal temperature. The yield of these crops, especially wheat, already showing signs of stagnation in most places of northwest India, is most likely to be affected by temperature changes. The solar radiation-temperature interactions study in wheat reveals some interesting trends and is seen to vary from one location to another. Keeping in view the trends in global climate change, a shift in sowing time, as an adaptation strategy is recommended. The simple and empirical relations between yield and seasonal temperature change can be well used for a crude estimate of yield dependence of temperature rise of these winter crops. radiation; simulation; sowing time; temperature change; winter crops; yield;NITROGEN AVAILABILITY; CLIMATIC FACTORS; LIMITATIONS SET; GRAIN-YIELD; WHEAT; GROWTH; PRODUCTIVITY; RADIATION; GENOTYPE; AEROSOLS","Comparative life cycle assessment of uses of rice husk for energy purposes Recently, the Thai government has been advancing the expanded use of biomass as an alternative source of energy substituting it for the fossil fuels that have been shown to be harmful to the environment. Rice husk, one of the main sources of biomass in Thailand, has already been used as an energy source in many different applications and has been successful in reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. At present (2011), the main use of rice husk in Thailand is as fuel to generate electricity. However, rice husk can potentially be used to produce other forms of energy such as cellulosic ethanol. This paper compares the environmental performance of the current main use of rice husk for energy purposes in the Thai context, i.e., for electricity generation with the prospective use, i.e., for cellulosic ethanol production. The results from this study will identify the more environmentally friendly option for use of rice husk for energy purposes. To determine the more environmentally friendly rice husk use option, that being the option that showed the greatest reduction of environmental impacts, the environmental impacts of the two selected rice husk use options were compared with the environmental impacts of their conventional energy production processes using the life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA software package SimaPro 7.1.6 was used to assist in the analysis of the environmental impacts, with the impact assessment method ReCiPe 2008. The system boundary of the study was expanded to take into consideration the effects caused by the consumption of coproducts generated within the two rice husk options. To make the options comparable, the functional units defined for both options were based on processing 1,000 tonnes of rice husk in both rice husk use systems studied. Based on the available data and assumptions made for this study, the results show that the use of rice husk in both electricity and cellulosic ethanol options had a significant effect in reducing the impacts on fossil fuel depletion and climate change, when compared with the conventional processes. However, the use of rice husk in both options caused a slightly higher impact on particulate matter formation than the conventional processes. The option of using rice husk to generate electricity was preferred over the option of using rice husk as a feedstock to produce cellulosic ethanol for all other impact categories analysed, except particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation and freshwater ecotoxicity. In addition, it was found that using rice husk to produce cellulosic ethanol caused a considerably greater impact on human toxicity than its conventional product. The environmental benefits gained by using rice husk depend on the materials that rice husk is replacing. This means that the reduction of environmental impact depends upon the use of the rice husk. Overall, the option of using rice husk to generate electricity shows benefits over the option of using rice husk to produce cellulosic ethanol for most impact categories analysed. However, the cellulosic ethanol option is better than the electricity option in terms of particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation and freshwater ecotoxicity. In the short run, the option of using rice husk to generate electricity is more environmentally friendly than the option of using rice husk to produce cellulosic ethanol. However, if rice husk is to be used for electricity generation, the ash generated in power plants should be sent out to be used in other industries. It should not be disposed of in landfills as it causes greater impacts than other ash use options. In the time of oil shortages, rice husk should be considered for use as a feedstock to produce cellulosic ethanol for use as a substitute for petrol to help reduce the dependency of oil importation for Thailand. However, the production process of cellulosic ethanol should be improved to help increase efficiency in reducing the environmental impacts in other impact categories.

A quantitative analysis of major newspapers from US, UK, and Australia According to the economy-environment trade-off, good economic conditions raise citizens' concerns about the environment, while economic recessions reduce the interest. This paper explores this hypothesis in print media and considers the quantitative media coverage of deforestation in three English-language newspapers between 1995 and 2015. The empirical findings reject the economy-environment trade-off and show that print media coverage of deforestation exhibits a modest but significant increase during economic downturns and slows down in case of good economic conditions. The mass media can reflect public opinion on major environmental issues but at the same time, tend to influence public opinion selecting and framing newsworthy issues. A stable media attention on deforestation issues, even during economic recessions, can contribute to create public support and legitimization for ambitious environmental policies aimed at governing forest conservation. ","Mitigating the Risk of Extreme Water Scarcity and Dependency: The Case of Jordan Jordan faces great internal water scarcity and pollution, conflict over trans-boundary waters, and strong dependency on external water resources through trade. This paper analyzes these issues and subsequently reviews options to reduce the risk of extreme water scarcity and dependency. Based on estimates of water footprint, water availability, and virtual water trade, we find that groundwater consumption is nearly double the groundwater availability, water pollution aggravates blue water scarcity, and Jordan's external virtual water import dependency is 86%. The review of response options yields 10 ingredients for a strategy for Jordan to mitigate the risks of extreme water scarcity and dependency. With respect to these ingredients, Jordan's current water policy requires a strong redirection towards water demand management. Actual implementation of the plans in the national water strategy (against existing oppositions) would be a first step. However, more attention should be paid to reducing water demand by changing the consumption pattern of Jordanian consumers. Moreover, unsustainable exploitation of the fossil Disi aquifer should soon be halted and planned desalination projects require careful consideration regarding the sustainability of their energy supply. water scarcity; water pollution; water footprint; virtual water trade; water dependency; water risk; water security; sustainability; water policy;IRRIGATION WATER; VIRTUAL WATER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SAFE YIELD; VALLEY; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; GROUNDWATER; STRATEGIES; FOOTPRINT","Organizational resilience: Sustained institutional effectiveness among smaller, private, non-profit US higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline BACKGROUND: Recent changes in the United States (US) economy have radically disrupted revenue generation among many institutions within higher education within the US. Chief among these disruptions has been fallout associated with the financial crisis of 2008-2009, which triggered a change in the US higher education environment from a period of relative munificence to a prolonged period of scarcity. The hardest hit by this disruption have been smaller, less wealthy institutions which tend to lack the necessary reserves to financially weather the economic storm. Interestingly, a review of institutional effectiveness among these institutions revealed that while many are struggling, some institutions have found ways to not only successfully cope with the impact of declining revenue, but have been able to capitalize on the disruption and thrive. OBJECTIVE: Organizational response is an important factor in successfully coping with conditions of organizational decline. The study examined the impacts of organizational response on institutional effectiveness among higher education institutions experiencing organizational decline. The study's research question asked why some US higher educational institutions are more resilient at coping with organizational decline than other institutions operating within the same segment of the higher education sector. More specifically, what role does organizational resilience have in helping smaller, private non-profit institutions cope and remain effective during organizational decline? PARTICIPANTS: A total of 141 US smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions participated in the study; specifically, the study included responses from participant institutions' key administrators. METHODS: 60-item survey evaluated administrator responses corresponding to organizational response and institutional effectiveness. Factor analysis was used to specify the underlying structures of rigidity response, resilience response, and institutional effectiveness. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the direct and interaction effects between organizational decline, organizational rigidity response, organizational resilience response, and institutional effectiveness, controlling for age of institution and level of endowment. RESULTS: The study validated previous threat-rigidity response findings that organizational decline alone does not adversely impact institutional effectiveness. The direct effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking and Role Dependency organizational resilience factors had a positive, significant correlation with the Student Personal Development institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Avoidance during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. The interactive effect of Diminished Innovation, Morale, and Leader Credibility rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Professional Development and Quality of Faculty institutional effectiveness factor. Lastly, the interactive effect of Increased Scapegoating of Leaders, Interest group Activities, and Conflict rigidity response factor and Avoidance organizational resilience factor during organizational decline had a positive, significant correlation with the Faculty and Administrator Employment Satisfaction institutional effectiveness factor. CONCLUSIONS: Factors of organizational resilience were found to have a positive effect among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions associated with this study toward sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline. Specifically, the organizational resilience factors of Goal-Directed Solution Seeking (i.e., mission-driven solutions) and Avoidance (i.e., skepticism toward new ideas) play a significant, collaborative role among smaller, private non-profit higher educational institutions when it comes to sustaining institutional effectiveness during organizational decline.

Using recently developed indicators of climatic macrorefugia, environmental diversity, and corridors, we conducted a systematic, climate-informed prioritization of conservation values across North America. We explicitly considered complementarity of multiple conservation objectives, capturing key niche-based temperature and moisture thresholds for 324 tree species and 268 songbird species. Conservation rankings were influenced most strongly by climate corridors and species-specific refugia layers. Although areas of high conservation value under climate change were partially aligned with existing protected areas, similar to 80% of areas within the top quintile of biome-level conservation values lack formal protection. Results from this study and application of our approach elsewhere can help improve the long-term value of conservation investments at multiple spatial scales. climate corridors; climate-change adaptation; conservation planning; protected areas; refugia; Zonation;BIODIVERSITY; VELOCITY","The status of climate change adaptation in fisheries management: Policy, legislation and implementation Climate change is altering ecosystems and fisheries throughout the world's oceans, demanding climate-adaptive governance for conserving and managing living marine resources. While in some regions fisheries management systems address wider ecosystem dynamics within management frameworks and decision-making, which may facilitate resilience to climate change, there remains a shortfall in terms of directly incorporating climate change adaptation into fisheries management legislation and implementation. This review assesses the current state of implementation of climate change adaptation into fisheries management policies and legislation across 11 national case studies, based on government documents and the primary literature. The overarching goal is to understand the key elements and gaps in existing fisheries management policies and legislation in the context of climate change. Given recent reforms of fisheries management policies and/or legislation across the nations examined, political recognition of the need to address climate change adaptation in fisheries management appears to be increasing; albeit formal mandates of climate-adaptation objectives in fisheries management are largely missing. Based on our review, recommendations for achieving climate-adaptive fisheries management regimes are developed. Overall, this study will help to inform and broaden the scope of management approaches and tools to accelerate the move towards adaptive fisheries management that accounts for climate change impacts on fish stocks, fisheries and the societies that depend upon them. climate change impacts; commercial fisheries; governance; management tools; marine ecosystems; mitigation strategies;ECOSYSTEM-BASED MANAGEMENT; ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; GLOBAL OCEAN; TRADE-OFFS; MARINE; IMPACTS; RESPONSES; FUTURE; SHIFTS; CATCH","Systematic Comparison of the Influence of Cool Wall versus Cool Roof Adoption on Urban Climate in the Los Angeles Basin This study for the first time assesses the influence of employing solar reflective ""cool"" walls on the urban energy budget and summertime climate of the Los Angeles basin. We systematically compare the effects of cool walls to cool roofs, a heat mitigation strategy that has been widely studied and employed, using a consistent modeling framework (the Weather Research and Forecasting model). Adoption of cool walls leads to increases in urban grid cell albedo that peak in the early morning and late afternoon, when the ratio of solar radiation onto vertical walls versus horizontal surfaces is at a maximum. In Los Angeles County, daily average increase in grid cell reflected solar radiation from increasing wall albedo by 0.80 is 9.1 W m(-2), 43% of that for increasing roof albedo. Cool walls reduce canyon air temperatures in Los Angeles by 0.43 K (daily average), with the peak reduction (0.64 K) occurring at 09:00 LST and a secondary peak (0.53 K) at 18:00 LST. Per 0.10 wall (roof) albedo increase, cool walls (roofs) can reduce summertime daily average canyon air temperature by 0.05 K (0.06 K). Results reported here can be used to inform policies on urban heat island mitigation or climate change adaptation. nan;HEAT-ISLAND MITIGATION; LAND EXPANSION; CANOPY MODEL; IMPACTS; SURFACE; PARAMETERIZATION; SIMULATION; STRATEGIES; VEGETATION; ALBEDO","Natural selection in a postglacial range expansion: the case of the colour cline in the European barn owl Gradients of variationor clineshave always intrigued biologists. Classically, they have been interpreted as the outcomes of antagonistic interactions between selection and gene flow. Alternatively, clines may also establish neutrally with isolation by distance (IBD) or secondary contact between previously isolated populations. The relative importance of natural selection and these two neutral processes in the establishment of clinal variation can be tested by comparing genetic differentiation at neutral genetic markers and at the studied trait. A third neutral process, surfing of a newly arisen mutation during the colonization of a new habitat, is more difficult to test. Here, we designed a spatially explicit approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) simulation framework to evaluate whether the strong cline in the genetically based reddish coloration observed in the European barn owl (Tyto alba) arose as a by-product of a range expansion or whether selection has to be invoked to explain this colour cline, for which we have previously ruled out the actions of IBD or secondary contact. Using ABC simulations and genetic data on 390 individuals from 20 locations genotyped at 22 microsatellites loci, we first determined how barn owls colonized Europe after the last glaciation. Using these results in new simulations on the evolution of the colour phenotype, and assuming various genetic architectures for the colour trait, we demonstrate that the observed colour cline cannot be due to the surfing of a neutral mutation. Taking advantage of spatially explicit ABC, which proved to be a powerful method to disentangle the respective roles of selection and drift in range expansions, we conclude that the formation of the colour cline observed in the barn owl must be due to natural selection. approximate Bayesian computation; cline; colour polymorphism; natural selection; range expansion;APPROXIMATE BAYESIAN COMPUTATION; LOCAL ADAPTATION; GENE FLOW; QUANTITATIVE TRAIT; COLONIZATION HISTORY; WINTER MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WAVE-FRONT; DIVERGENCE; POPULATION","Natural gas prices, electric generation investment, and greenhouse gas emissions Between 2007 and 2013 the natural gas price dramatically declined, in large part due to hydraulic fracturing. These lower natural gas prices induced switching from coal generation to natural gas generation. I find that switching caused 2013 carbon emissions to fall by 14,700 tons/h. Lower gas prices also incentivized new investment in natural gas capacity. This less carbon-intensive capital stock led to an additional decrease of 2,100 tons/h in 2013. Using three approaches, I estimate that 65-85% of new capacity was constructed because of lower gas prices. A social cost of carbon of $35/ton values the estimated total decrease in 2013 emissions at roughly $5.1 billion. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ","Increased risk of Legionella pneumonia as community-acquired pneumonia after heavy rainfall in 2018 in west Japan Introduction: Japan experienced a heavy rainfall event from June 28 to July 8, 2018, and many casualties were caused by both heavy rainfall and flooding. Few studies have investigated patients' characteristics and the causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia before and after heavy rainfall events. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia before and after the heavy rainfall event using prospective cohort data. Methods: The study was divided into two periods: July to November 2013-2017 (before heavy rainfall) and July to November 2018 (after heavy rainfall). The patients' clinical characteristics and causative pathogens before and after the heavy rainfall were investigated. Regarding the causative pathogens, adjustments were made for precipitation and seasonal patterns. Results: There were no significant differences in the number and clinical characteristics of patients before and after heavy rainfall. However, the frequency of Legionella pneumonia was significantly higher after than before the heavy rainfall event (8.9% vs 3.0%, P = 0.02) and remained significant after adjusting for precipitation and season. Three of 7 Legionella pneumonia patients engaged in reconstruction work and 2 Legionella pneumonia patients had soil exposure. Conclusions: An increased risk of Legionella pneumonia after not only rainfall and serious flooding, but also following recovery work or soil exposure should be considered.

The Chinese government launched a series of policies to promote battery electric vehicles (BEVs) to slow down the greenhouse effect. Zero emissions of BEVs have been achieved in the driving phase but not in the charging phase. Whether BEVs can achieve emission reduction needs to be further verified compared with FVs. The paper considered evaluating the CO2 emission reduction effects after the promotion of BEVs by the Chinese government, which adopted the Well-to-Wheel (WTW) approach. Furthermore, the CO2 emission reduction impact factors of BEVs would be verified by sensitivity analysis with the number of BEVs and the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The results show that BEV emission reductions can reach 4.15 million tons by 2020, the CO2 emission reductions are mainly distributed in the areas with a high RPS ratio, such as East China, and the emission reduction of battery electric buses (BEBs) is better than private battery electric cars (PBECs) and battery electric taxis (BETs). The emission reduction of the three categories of BEVs is affected by the number of BEVs and the RPS.

Potential economic ramifications for ski operators are assessed separately for the main revenue-generating period and shoulder seasons. The paper concludes that climate change does not pose a threat to the Quebec ski industry under 2020s scenarios and that, while adequate snow base can be maintained with additional snowmaking under even the warmest scenario for the 2050s, the combined economic impact of lost revenue opportunities from a shortened ski season and increased snowmaking costs will likely prove prohibitive for some ski operators. ","Estimation of losses and damages caused by flash floods in the commercial area of Kajang, Selangor, Malaysia Flash flood is the most devastating natural disaster experienced in Malaysia. It can be defined as any high water flow caused by various factors such as rainstorms, slow water run-off, and broken dams. In Malaysia, the most typical and disruptive hydro-meteorological occurrences are flash floods, which are mostly faced by Malaysian cities including Kuala Lumpur and Kajang. However, flash floods may occur at any time of the year rather than during monsoon and can result in devastating losses and damages. Thus, several mitigation steps and estimations are warranted to handle flash floods, especially at the city level. Hence, this paper estimated the amount of direct loss and damage due to flash floods on the basis of the commercial area of Kajang City. This empirical study used primary data collected through direct face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 41 businessmen in the study area. The average estimated overall losses and damages per shop were RM4,510.07 due to flash floods at Kajang City in 2014, wherein the significant contribution comes from the economic side. This study's findings can serve as the baseline information for future studies on flash flood losses and damages. Furthermore, the present study suggests extensive institutional research for estimating losses and damages due to flash floods at the country level as an adaptation strategy.

Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a commonly used tool to assess potential climate change impacts on distributions of species. We use SDMs to predict geographic ranges for 243 birds of Australian tropical savannas, and to project changes in species richness and ranges under a future climate scenario between 1990 and 2080. Realistic predictions require recognition of the variability in species capacity to track climatically suitable environments. Here we assess the effect of dispersal on model results by using three approaches: full dispersal, no dispersal and a partial-dispersal scenario permitting species to track climate change at a rate of 30 km per decade. As expected, the projected distributions and richness patterns are highly sensitive to the dispersal scenario. Projected future range sizes decreased for 66% of species if full dispersal was assumed, but for 89% of species when no dispersal was assumed. However, realistic future predictions should not assume a single dispersal scenario for all species and as such, we assigned each species to the most appropriate dispersal category based on individual mobility and habitat specificity; this permitted the best estimates of where species will be in the future. Under this ""realistic"" dispersal scenario, projected ranges sizes decreased for 67% of species but showed that migratory and tropical-endemic birds are predicted to benefit from climate change with increasing distributional area. Richness hotspots of tropical savanna birds are expected to move, increasing in southern savannas and southward along the east coast of Australia, but decreasing in the arid zone. Understanding the complexity of effects of climate change on species' range sizes by incorporating dispersal capacities is a crucial step toward developing adaptation policies for the conservation of vulnerable species.

Design/methodology/approach - The water evaluation and planning (WEAP) tool, is to identify future water resource vulnerability in the Glore sub-catchment within the Moy catchment in the West of Ireland. Where water stress is evident, a detailed hydrological modelling approach is developed to enable an assessment of the robustness to uncertainty of future adaptation decisions. WEAP is coupled with a rainfall runoff model (hydrological simulation model), and forced using climate scenarios, statistically downscaled from three global climate models to account for the key sources of uncertainty. While hydrological models are widely applied, they are subject to uncertainties derived from model structure and the parameterisation of the catchment. Here, random sampling of key parameters is employed to incorporate uncertainty from the hydrological modelling process. Behavioural parameter sets are used to generate multiple future streamflow series to determine where the bounds within future hydrological regimes may lie and the ranges within which future adaptation policy pathways need to function. Findings - This framework allows the identification of adaptation options that are robust to uncertainty in future simulations. Research limitations/implications - Future research will focus on the development of more site-specific adaptation options including soft and hard adaptation strategies. This approach will be applied to multiple water resource regions within Ireland. Originality/value - A robust adaptation assessment decreases the risk of expensive and/or mal-adaptations in a critical sector for society, the economy and the aquatic environment.

Considering its involvement in the global anthropogenic emissions (GHG) it is no wonder that research is devising ways on how to reduce such effects. A solution to such problems is climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In this paper, we analysed which are the main opportunities granted by agricultural policies when aimed at sustaining innovative agricultural models. A review of the ongoing 93 Rural Development Projects (RDPs) uncovered potential climate-smart solutions for the identified potential threats. The Ministry of Agriculture, Hunting and Fishing of the Region of Emilia-Romagna in Italy has given importance to RDPs to innovate the agricultural sector through policy measures. We analysed an Operational Group (OG) project as an overview of the work. In the case of Emilia-Romagna, the amount of innovation and solutions that can be achieved if policies invest in CSA is very clear. Emilia-Romagna is on the forefront of technological and practical advancements in the EU by implementing CSA as one of the primary solutions to the aforementioned problems and will continuously work on transitioning its agricultural practices to fight climate change.

Conceptualizing integrated water resources management for implementing sustainable development goals While the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015, establishes an ambitious set of goals, targets and indicators for supporting global sustainability, greater conceptual clarity is required to measure implementation. A key UN Target (6.5) for implementing sustainable development goal (SDG) 6 is to 'implement integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels'. However, we argue that the current UN emphasis on measuring its implementation through institutional indicators limits our understanding of effectiveness, while ignoring links to other SDGs. While IWRM is often interpreted to mean the integration of water-related management components at the river basin scale, conceptualizations differ significantly. Specifying the critical normative principles of IWRM, therefore, becomes important for measuring its implementation. Drawing upon pre-existing conceptualizations, we consequently identify seven core principles or dimensions (integration; scale; institutions; participation; economic valuation; equity; and, environmental/ecological protection) to re-conceptualize IWRM after the adoption of agenda 2030. These dimensions, we argue, allow more objective measurement of IWRM implementation through the development of Target 6.5 sub-indicators. They also help shift IWRM beyond its current 'water centric' emphasis to enhance its contribution to achieving other SDGs such as those for ending poverty, providing clean and affordable energy, achieving gender equality, protecting terrestrial ecosystems, promoting sustainable cities, combatting hunger and climate change, and strengthening the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development.

EPI aims to avoid conflicts between environmental and other policy objectives and to enhance environmental policy by directly targeting the driving forces of environmental degradation. In practice, however, the potential of EPI has not been fully utilized. Scientific knowledge of EPI is found in several, largely isolated, bodies of literature (on EPI, climate policy integration and environmental impact assessment/strategic environmental assessment) and does not provide an adequate answer to the question of what EPI strategies work, where and why. A systematic framework based on comparative empirical research is required to contribute to more effective EPI strategies. In this paper we formulate a research agenda for the development of such a framework on the governance of EPI that is robust, i.e. builds on other theories of environmental governance and policy change and that envisages large-scale, international comparative empirical analysis. Copyright ","Modelling weather risk preferences with multi-criteria decision analysis for an aerospace vehicle launch Decision-making under weather uncertainty is a challenge in several fields. When the decision process involves many stakeholders, frequently with different interpretations of the meteorological information, the process is even more complex. This work provides a quantitative decision model with a new index (called the weather decision index, WDI) to support the stakeholders in making real-world choices according to their preferences regarding the uncertainty of weather information. The integrated model combines several methods such as problem structuring, multi-criteria analysis, scenario planning and probabilistic weather forecast techniques. As a demonstration, the model was applied in the sounding rocket launch mission in the Brazilian Space Programme. The WDI captured stakeholders' behaviour related to three meteorological information attributes (probability, lead-time and variables) and modelled the most important judgements of the decision maker; low probability or an extended lead-time depreciates the meteorological information, and weather variables are not considered in the decisions, even with forecasts of extreme events. Modelling with the WDI brings a new perspective in weather-related decision problems. The choice of alternatives no longer depends on a necessarily simplified optimization analysis, but rather on the decision maker's preferences about the possibly nonlinear trade-offs between forecast reliability and lead-time. The findings also increase understanding of the forecast decision maker's preferences and how to improve weather risk communication. The WDI provides a starting point for several applications, including early warning systems or climate change adaptation, for which reliable uncertainty estimates are accessible. weather decision index; decision under uncertainty; multi-attribute decision model; aerospace meteorology; sounding rocket launch; Brazilian Space Programme;UNCERTAINTY; METEOROLOGY; PROGRAM; SCIENCE","Urban resilience: A vague or an evolutionary concept? Considering the rapid urbanization trends in many parts of the world and the increasing consequences of climate change, more and more cities are at risk of natural disasters and other environmental, socio-economic, and political disruptions. To address these issues, resilience thinking has attracted the attention of a wide range of stakeholders. However, despite considerable attention to this concept and its frequent usage, resilience remains ambiguous with diverse interpretations in policy discussions and academic debates about cities. Since such vague interpretations would lead to difficulties in theory and practice, the present study aims to clarify some of these concepts by providing a comprehensive review focused on resilience features and comparing different perspectives regarding urban resilience. The study results showed that the main reason behind such ambiguities is that resilience has undergone fundamental changes since its inception, and recent approaches to resilience are generally based on the non-equilibrium model of resilience. There are three main dimensions, including systems, agents, and institutions, as well as three main approaches to urban resilience, including recovery, adaptation, and transformation. This study's conceptual framework of urban resilience provides scholars and policymakers with a more transparent and comprehensive picture of urban resilience and helps them make better-informed decisions.

We set out to project future temperature-related myocardial infarction (MI) events in Augsburg, Germany, at increases in warming of 1.5 degrees C, 2 degrees C, and 3 degrees C. Methods: Using daily time series of MI cases and temperature projections under two climate scenarios, we projected changes in temperature-related MIs at different increases in warming, assuming no changes in population structure or level of adaptation. Results: In a low-emission scenario that limits warming to below 2 degrees C throughout the 21st century, temperature-related MI cases will decrease slightly by -6 (confidence interval -60; 50) per decade at 1.5 degrees C of warming. In a high-emission scenario going beyond the Paris Agreement goals, temperature-related MI cases will increase by 18 (-64; 117) and 63 (-83; 257) per decade with warming of 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C, respectively. Conclusion: The future burden of temperature-related MI events in Augsburg at 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C of warming will be greater than at 1.5 degrees C. Fulfilling the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees C is therefore essential to avoid additional MI events due to climate change. nan;HEAT-RELATED MORTALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AMI-REGISTRY; MONICA/KORA; DEATHS","Financing climate change mitigation: An assessment of the private sector investment opportunities in Ghana The funding required for climate mitigation in Africa is estimated at 10 billion U.S. dollars annually. Unfortunately, the contributions by advanced countries will not be enough to meet the mitigation needs of developing countries. Emerging economies like Ghana have low financial capacity to effectively mitigate the harsh impacts of climate change. However, the proportion of private sector investment for climate change mitigation (CCM) keeps increasing-making it a major source of climate change finance. The paper examined the investment opportunities in CCM for private firms in Ghana. The study used qualitative research approach through in-depth interviews with 25 private sector organisations, key development partners, and climate change experts and policy makers. The study found a number of opportunities for private sector investment in energy, agriculture, transport, waste, industry, and buildings in Ghana. The private sector has competencies, which can make a unique contribution to climate mitigation through investment in innovative technology and capacity building. The study revealed a number of barriers, which are hindering the private sector from investing in CCM in Ghana. The paper urged the government to create awareness of the investment opportunities and provide incentives to attract the private firms to scale up climate change financing and investment in Ghana. ","Adaptation can help mitigation: an integrated approach to post-2012 climate policy This paper analyzes the optimal mix of adaptation and mitigation expenditures in a cost-effective setting, in which countries cooperate to achieve a long-term stabilization target (550 CO2-eq). It uses an Integrated Assessment Model (AD-WITCH) that describes the relationships between different adaptation modes (reactive and anticipatory), mitigation and capacity building to analyze the optimal portfolio of adaptation measures. Results show that the optimal intertemporal distribution of climate policy measures is characterized by early investments in mitigation followed by large adaptation expenditures a few decades later. Hence, the possibility of adapting does not justify postponing mitigation. Moreover, a climate change policy combining mitigation and adaptation is less costly than mitigation alone. In this sense mitigation and adaptation are shown to be strategic complements rather than mutually exclusive. ","Temporal Variations of Citizens' Demands on Flood Damage Mitigation, Streamflow Quantity and Quality in the Korean Urban Watershed Sustainable watershed management (SWM) can be achieved through recognition and reflection upon the values of citizens. Collaborative governance consisting of citizens is crucial for successful SWM. Collaborative governance definitely requires an active participatory decision-making process that reflects citizens' preferences. Citizen preference also tends to substantially change with life pattern and life quality. These shifts can be caused by slight variations in both social priorities and personal preferences for SWM. Therefore, collaborative water governance must be frequently renewed in response to citizens' values through the participatory framework. The An'yang Stream in South Korea is generally regarded as a representative urban stream restoration case that has been successfully led by collaborative governance. By conducting individual surveys with citizens on-site, this study addresses how citizens' preferences of the stream's management have changed between 2005 and 2015. In addition, this study used three quantitative hydrologic vulnerability indices: potential flood damage (PFD), potential streamflow depletion (PSD), and potential water quality deterioration (PWQD). They can spatially quantify citizen preference using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which can systematically derive citizens' subjective relative-weighted preferences. In the end, this study identified critical differences in priorities in regard to vulnerable areas between in 2005 and in 2015. sustainable watershed planning; collaborative governance; analytic hierarchy process (AHP); hydrological vulnerability; potential flood damage (PFD); potential streamflow (PSD); potential water quality deterioration (PWQD);DECISION-MAKING; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK","Climate change impact and adaptation for highway asphalt pavements: a literature review For the past few decades, researchers all over the world have agreed that the service life of civil infrastructure is significantly affected by climate change. Pavement is one of these significant infrastructures that can be easily affected by climate change. However, it is well known that predicting climate change is highly complex and dynamic. Hence, a review has been done on available climate change models and the uncertainties involved in climate change prediction. This review addresses various important questions, such as (i) what climate change is, (ii) how to use climate change models, (iii) uncertainties involved in using climate change models, (iv) how climate change impacts pavement infrastructure, (v) the adaptation and mitigation strategies available, and (vi) how economic costs and emissions change due to climate change.

Therefore, bias correction methods are operationally used to post-process regional climate projections. However, many problems have been identified, and some researchers question the very basis of the approach. Here we demonstrate that a typical cross-validation is unable to identify improper use of bias correction. Several examples show the limited ability of bias correction to correct and to downscale variability, and demonstrate that bias correction can cause implausible climate change signals. Bias correction cannot overcome major model errors, and naive application might result in ill-informed adaptation decisions. We conclude with a list of recommendations and suggestions for future research to reduce, post-process, and cope with climate model biases. nan;CHANGE IMPACT; EUROPEAN CLIMATE; GLOBAL CLIMATE; MODEL; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; RESOLUTION; CIRCULATION; LOCATION; DATASET","Simulating Runoff and Actual Evapotranspiration via Time-Variant Parameter Method: The Effects of Hydrological Model Structures Modeling methodologies capable of coping with changing catchment conditions are becoming more important and are critical to ensure credible model predictions because the hydrologic process of the catchment is inevitably affected by climate change and human activities. A recently developed hydrological modeling framework that treats model parameters to be time-variant by building functions based on identified catchment properties is applied to the Upper Ganjiang River Basin in China experienced soil and water conservation constructions. The efficacy of the time-variant parameter method is investigated, and we further explore the impacts of model structure on hydrological modeling through this method. The approach is tested using two conceptual monthly water balance models, i.e., the ab model derived from the abcd model, and a two-parameter monthly water balance model (TWBM), which have the same model inputs and outputs, number of parameters and state variables. Results of the case study show that through the comparative analysis with the constant parameter models, both time-variant parameter models provide improved runoff simulations, especially for low and high flows. Moreover, the time-variant parameter method brings relatively larger runoff improvements for the TWBM model. For the actual evapotranspiration simulations, the ab model can yield improvements by treating parameter b (i.e., upper soil zone water holding capacity) to be time-variant, whereas the time-variant parameter method shows no efficacy in that for the TWBM model. The results demonstrate that the choice of hydrological model plays an important role in modeling performance of the time- variant parameter framework under a changing environment. Modification of the evapotranspiration calculation module for the TWBM model could be considered as further study to investigate the potential model improvement that compared with only time-variant parameters. This study can provide beneficial reference to comprehensively understand the impacts of changing environment on catchment hydrological modeling and thus improve the regional strategy for future water resource management.

However, the Gyirong corridor suffers from glacier-related debris flow from every April to September because of the complex topographic features and the changing climate. Therefore, a susceptibility map in response to precipitation and temperature change is timely, not only to ensure the safe operation of this corridor, but also to provide decision-makers a guidance for hazard mitigation and environmental remediation. Conventional method is difficult to consider and link the meteorological factors (e.g. temperature and precipitation), topographies, ecological, geological conditions all together to produce the susceptibility map, as such, machine learning is utilised to conduct the analysis. Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were firstly applied to evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of producing the susceptibility map. In order to improve the fitting and prediction accuracy (ACC), genetic algorithm support vector machine (GA-SVM) and certainty factor genetic algorithm support vector machine (CF-GA-SVM) were conducted based on the initial analysis results of receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and ACC. Through the analysis, it can be seen that over 61% of the study areas have a high susceptibility to debris flow, requiring an intensive attention from the local government. To further optimise the computational time, when dealing with small amounts of sample data, SVM is more efficient than LR, but CF-GA-SVM can achieve the highest AUC (Area Under Curve) and ACC values, 0.945 and 0.800, respectively. Overall, CF-GA-SVM model presents a relatively high robustness according to sensitivity analysis. nan;China-Nepal Economic Corridor; Environmental change; Glacier-related debris flow; Optimised SVM; Susceptibility maps; Climate change; Climate models; Curve fitting; Debris; Decision making; Factor analysis; Genetic algorithms; Sensitivity analysis; Certainty factors; Changing climate; China-nepal economic corridor; Debris flows; Environmental change; Genetic algorithm support vector machines; Glacier-related debris flow; Optimized support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Susceptibility maps; Support vector machines; area under the curve; article; attention; China; climate; earthquake; ecosystem restoration; environmental change; genetic algorithm; glacier; government; Nepal; precipitation; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity analysis; support vector machine; topography; watershed; climate change; ice cover; machine learning; statistical model; support vector machine; Climate Change; Ice Cover; Logistic Models; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machine","Mainstreaming climate adaptation in Switzerland: How the national adaptation strategy is implemented differently across sectors Due to few comparative studies, explanations for differences in adaptation mainstreaming between sectors remain widely unclear. The article analyzes how adaptation mainstreaming was approached during the development of the Swiss National Adaptation Strategy and to what extent adaptation objectives were mainstreamed into sectoral policies. The analysis reveals that in Switzerland, adaptation objectives are integrated more substantially into sectoral policies when they overlap with primary sectoral objectives but generally backing by organizational and procedural measures is lacking. The results suggest a similar pattern for adaptation mainstreaming as for EPI: While policy frameworks such as strategies are adopted rather easily, a move towards more binding measures that interfere with sectoral policy-making and the existing institutional structure is much more challenging. In contrast to environmental concerns, climate change impacts are expected to be considered more substantially resulting in a more substantive mainstreaming of adaptation objectives and measures on a sectoral level. As these measures might negatively affect other sectors, the main challenge of adaptation mainstreaming is to consistently address the cross-cutting nature of adaption and to establish procedures to coordinate sectoral measures in order to avoid such negative externalities.

Through a survey, we obtain a household level data from goat producers in designated climate-smart and non-climate-smart villages of the Lawra and Jirapa districts in Upper West region of Ghana. Data are analysed using a multivariate probit model to assess how perceptions and other factors influence coping and adaptation strategy choices. Seven main coping/adaptation strategies are used by goat farmers to deal with weather variability and climate change. Our econometric results show that goat farmers' perceptions and being located in a climate-smart village, as well as market and extension information influence the choice of coping and adaptation strategies towards climate change. The results suggest that perceptions of weather variability and climate change have significant positive influence on all adaptation strategies, and that these adaptation strategies are complementary to each other as evidenced by their high inter-correlations. The fact that farmers located in climate-smart villages are more likely to adopt strategies that enable them to cope with and adapt to weather variability and climate change signals the need for project implementers to extend the number of villages benefiting from the climate-smart village concept.

An historical overview of planning ideas in both the urban and the rural contexts indicates that the concept, if not the term, ""green infrastructure"" has a very long and distinguished pedigree in the field of landscape and open space planning. To determine how far the concept is indeed new, definitions of green infrastructure from the literature are examined. While ""green"" has long been loosely used as a synonym for natural features and vegetation in the planning context, ""infrastructure"" is the part of the term which is really novel. Infrastructure is otherwise understood as being either ""technical"" or ""social"", and the common features of these otherwise very different forms are considered in order to gain a better understanding of how they might also relate to a new interpretation of green infrastructure. A number of international case studies of different ""green infrastructure"" projects are then presented, again to better understand their common features and potential relationship to other infrastructure types. Finally, the necessity to consider green and blue areas together and to take them as seriously as other forms of infrastructure is emphasized. The developing climate and biodiversity crises underline the urgency of implementing a flexible and multifunctional green-blue infrastructure system. This must be carefully integrated into the existing fabric of both urban and rural landscapes and will require an appropriately resourced administration and management system, reflecting its beneficial impacts. green infrastructure; landscape and open space planning; climate change; biodiversity crisis; gray and social infrastructure; green corridor; green infrastructure elements;nan","The Effect of Sponge City Construction for Reducing Directly Connected Impervious Areas on Hydrological Responses at the Urban Catchment Scale Low-impact development (LID) has been widely used at both site-specific and local scales to try and mitigate the impact of urban stormwater runoff caused by increasing impervious urban areas. Recently, the concept of a ""sponge city"" was proposed by the Chinese government, which includes LID controls at the source, a pipe drainage system midway, and a drainage system for excess stormwater at the terminal. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of sponge city construction at the large urban catchment scale, particularly with different spatial distributions of LIDs that reduce directly connected impervious areas (DCIAs). In this paper, the performances of five design scenarios with different spatial distributions but same sizes of LID controls at the urban catchment scale were analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS) of the United States Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI)-based Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and MIKE 11 of Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI) in Xining City, China. Results confirmed the effectiveness of sponge city construction in reducing the urban stormwater runoff. The hydrological performance reduction was positively correlated and linearly dependent on DCIA reduction. Peak flow reduction was most sensitive to DCIA reduction, followed by runoff volume and peak time. As rainfall intensity increased, the hydrological performance was more sensitive to rainfall intensity than DCIA reduction. Results of this study provide new insights for stormwater managers to implement LID more effectively at the urban catchment scale. sponge city construction; stormwater management; directly connected impervious area; urban catchment scale;LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; LAND-USE; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; SURFACE CONNECTIVITY; WATER-QUALITY; STORMWATER; MITIGATION; MANAGEMENT; REDUCTION; SYSTEM","Climate Change: Impacts on Climatic Actions and Structural Reliability Featured Application This study provides a general methodology for the assessment of the impact of climate change on reliability of structures, combining observations and climate projections, to the aim of giving guidance for the adaptation of climatic load maps in structural Codes. Abstract Climatic loads on structures are commonly defined under the assumption of stationary climate conditions; but, as confirmed by recent studies, they can significantly vary because of climate change effects, with relevant impacts not only for the design of new structures but also for the assessment of the existing ones. In this paper, a general methodology to evaluate the influence of climate change on climatic actions is presented, based on the analysis of observed data series and climate projections. Illustrative results in terms of changes in characteristic values of temperature, precipitation, snow, and wind loads are discussed for Italy and Germany, with reference to different climate models and radiative forcing scenarios. In this way, guidance for potential amendments in the current definition of climatic actions in structural codes is provided. Finally, the influence of climate change on the long-term structural reliability is estimated for a specific case study, showing the potential of the proposed methodology. climate change; climate models; extremes; climatic actions; structural reliability;EURO-CORDEX; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; MULTIMODEL ENSEMBLE; SNOW LOADS; PROBABILITY; SIMULATIONS; TRENDS","The challenge of locating land-based climate change mitigation and adaptation politics within a social justice perspective: towards an idea of agrarian climate justice The global land rush and mainstream climate change narratives have broadened the ranks of state and social actors concerned about land issues, while strengthening those opposed to social justice-oriented land policies. This emerging configuration of social forces makes the need for deep social reforms through redistribution, recognition, restitution, regeneration and resistance - book-ended by the twin principles of maximum land size' (size ceiling') and a guaranteed minimum land access' (size floor') - both more compelling and urgent, and, at the same time, more difficult than ever before. The five deep social reforms of socially just land policy are necessarily intertwined. But the global land rush amidst deepening climate change calls attention to the linkages, especially between the pursuit of agrarian justice on the one hand and climate justice on the other. Here, the relationship is not without contradictions, and warrants increased attention as both unit of analysis and object of political action. Understanding and deepening agrarian justice imperatives in climate politics, and understanding and deepening climate justice imperatives in agrarian politics, is needed more than ever in the ongoing pursuit of alternatives.

Objectives: We aimed to find a best heat wave definition for CHD mortality; and explore the characteristic of heat wave effects on CHD in Beijing, China. Methods: We obtained daily data on weather and CHD mortality in Beijing for years 2000-2011. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to assess the short-term impact of heat waves on CHD mortality in hot season (May-September), while controlling for relative humidity, day of the week, long-term trend and season. We compared 18 heat wave definitions by combining heat wave thresholds (87.5th, 90.0th, 92.5th, 95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile of daily mean temperature) with different duration days (>= 2 to >= 4 days), using Akaike information criterion for quasi-Poisson. We examined whether heat wave effects on CHD mortality were modified by heat wave duration and timing. Results: Heat wave definition using 97.5th percentile of daily mean temperature (30.5 degrees C) and duration >= 2 days produced the best model fit. Based on this heat wave definition, we found that men and elderly were sensitive to the first heat waves of the season, while women and young were sensitive to the second heat waves. In general, the longer duration of heat waves increased the risks of CHD mortality more than shorter duration for elderly. The first two days of heat waves had the highest impact on CHD mortality. Women and elderly were at higher risks than men and young when exposed to heat waves, but the effect differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Heat waves had significant impact on CHD mortality. This finding may have implications for policy making towards protecting human health from heat waves. nan;AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; CASE-CROSSOVER; COLD SPELLS; SAO-PAULO; IMPACT; RISK; CITY","Fuzzy Inference System for Robust Rule-Based Reservoir Operation under Nonstationary Inflows Although a number of adaptation strategies for coping with the ever-growing problem of inflow nonstationarity have been proposed in the reservoir operation literature, the robustness of reservoir operating rules to inflow nonstationarity has largely been ignored. This present study fills this gap. Fuzzy inference system based reservoir operating rules (FIS-ORs) are developed by optimization-simulation and compared with linear, nonlinear, and artificial neural network rules under simulated stationary and nonstationary inflow conditions. Results are obtained for two case studies assuming, in each case, a single reservoir with water supply, flood control, and environmental flow allocation functions. The FIS-ORs are found to be most robust to inflow nonstationarity. Applying the FIS-ORs to 30years of projected future inflows show their advantage to be enhanced when they are recalibrated every 10years or so, as compared to when there is no recalibration. It is also observed the advantage of the FIS-ORs to be more significant when the weighting of the problem objectives is such that the overall objective function is more difficult to satisfy.

Building municipal capacities for citizen participation in adaptation is important to enabling such transformational changes but remains challenging. By applying capacities distilled from the literature on Urban Transformative Capacity and Participatory Climate Governance in a Swedish municipal case, this study aims to disentangle key limits for, and innovations to strengthen, local capacities for citizen participation in transformative climate adaptation. Interviews with municipal officials, focus groups with citizens, and document analyses were employed to analyse how climate adaptation and citizen participation are governed, and how these policy areas are interacting and could be bridged. The study points at conditions that foremost prevent bridging established policies and practices on adaptation and citizen participation, stemming from the different logics and distribution of responsibility within, and lacking collaboration between, these separated policy areas. The analysis concludes that potential ways to enable citizen participation in adaptation involve: broadening the geographical boundaries of deliberations; redefining the target groups for participation; co-designing participation targets, approaches and evaluation; and developing new ways to analyse and act on the patterns in the citizen inputs received. citizen participation; climate change adaptation; urban transformative capacity;COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; ENGAGEMENT; CITIES; CITY","Frontiers in Social-Ecological Urbanism This paper describes a new approach in urban ecological design, referred to as social- ecological urbanism (SEU).

The paper elaborates on three types of media for urban designers to intervene in urban systems, including urban form, institutions, and discourse, that together function as a significant enabler of urban change. The paper ends by presenting four future research frontiers with a potential to advance the field of social-ecological urbanism: (1) urban density and critical biodiversity thresholds, (2) human and non-human movement in urban space, (3) the retrofitting of urban design, and (4) reversing the trend of urban ecological illiteracy through affordance designs that connect people with nature and with each other. social-ecological systems; urban design; climate-change adaptation; ecosystem services; cognitive resilience building;SPATIAL MORPHOLOGY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CITIES; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY; HABITAT; SPACE; CONNECTEDNESS; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY","Cultural Theory's Contributions to Risk Analysis: A Thematic Review with Directions and Resources for Further Research Cultural theory (CT) developed from grid/group analysis, which posits that different patterns of social relations-hierarchist, individualist, egalitarian, and fatalist-produce compatible cultural biases influencing assessment of which hazards pose high or low risk and how to manage them.

At the same time, there are concerns over its relevance for future adaptation amidst other challenges. This article aims to shed light on some of the key potentials and challenges for the application of local knowledge for adaptation, drawing on recent studies as well as findings from semi-arid Tanzania. This article illustrates how the role of local knowledge at the local level is determined by interaction between informal and formal institutions at the local level. It suggests that assessments of the role of local knowledge for adaptation need to give more consideration to local power relations and the interaction with government strategies, while also addressing structural constraints to the use of local knowledge across scales.

On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2-3% of the Earth's landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an 'enzymic latch' on decomposition. Here, we propose to harness that mechanism in a series of peatland geoengineering strategies whereby molecular, biogeochemical, agronomical and afforestation approaches increase carbon capture and long-term sequestration in peat-forming terrestrial ecosystems. peatland geoengineering; carbon sequestration; phenolic compounds; inhibition; decomposition; enzymic latch;DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PHENOL OXIDASE ACTIVITY; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; ELEVATED CO2; PLANT COMMUNITY; WELSH PEATLAND; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NORTH-AMERICA; SPHAGNUM; SOIL","Phenological Asynchronization as a Restrictive Factor of Efficient Pollination in Clonal Seed Orchads of Pedunculate Oak (Quercus robur L.) The knowledge of the flowering biology of forest trees, and thus also of Pedunculate Oak, is exceptionally important when planning to mass-produce genetically high-quality seeds at clonal seed orchards (CSO) for the purpose of reforestation and restoration of forest cultures. The production of genetically high-quality seeds at CSOs, which assumes a high degree of genetic diversity, can only be guaranteed if 20 to 60 clones of different genotypes contribute to pollination (transferring of pollen from stamen to stigma). However, for a successful fertilization, which would guarantee the desired quality and quantity of seeds, phenological synchronization of the clone flowering within CSOs is also important. The beginning of pedunculate oak bud burst is under significant genetic control, which opens up the possibility to make the right selection of plus trees, with the goal of achieving a permanent phenological synchronization of flowering and flushing of clones with which the CSOs have been established. However, the effect of poor weather, such as heavy rainfall, too high or too low relative humidity of air, low temperatures, frosts, hail, etc., can sometimes disrupt favorable phenological synchronization of clones, also lowering the quality and quantity of seeds produced. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the phenological synchronization of clone flowering within CSOs, (ii) to look into the possible effect of weather on the duration of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding, (iii) to determine the degree of correspondence between particular phenophases of flushing and flowering. The study has been conducted at the experimental field founded in the spring of 2008 within Rasadnik Brestje (Forest Administration Zagreb, Forest Office Dugo Selo). The experimental field has been founded by planting ramet in accordance with the experimental design of randomized section system with repetitions (sections). Each clone is represented with one ramet in each section. Ramets originate from the clones of pedunculate oak, from which clonal seed orchards were founded in the regions under respective Forest Administrations (FAs) Vinkovci (VK), Nasice (NA) and Bjelovar (BP. Phenological observations of flushing and flowering were performed simultaneously, twice a week, until the leaves were fully developed on all clones, i.e. until all male flowers ceased to shed pollen or until all female flowers ceased to be receptive. The phenology of flushing was monitored in accordance with the methodology which distinguishes 7 phenophases in the flushing of pedunculate oak, while the phenology of flowering was monitored according to the methodology developed on the example of cork oak (Quercus suber L.). In this study, during the phenological monitoring of flowering, special attention was given to phenophases of male flower development, which describe the beginning and the end of pollen shedding, i.e. to phenophases of female flowers, which describe the beginning and the end of their receptivity. Microclimatic conditions during flowering (from April 7 to May 23) in 2010 were measured via automatic meteorological station set up at the experimental field. From a total of 145 clones, 103 were flowering at the experimental field in 2010, 8 of which only with male flowers, 31 only with female flowers, and 63 with both male and female flowers. Protogyny was established for the clones flowering with both male and female flowers, except for the clone VK 43 where protandry was established. The receptivity of female flowers of protogynous clones occurred on average 7 days before the male flowers began shedding pollen, while the VK 43 clone started releasing pollen a day before female flowers started to be receptive. Generally speaking for all the clones represented at the experimental field and flowering in 2010, pollen shedding started on April 15, and ended on May 22. The receptivity of female flowers started on April 13, and ended on May 13. From the moment the first clone started shedding pollen untill shedding stopped, 37 days have elapsed, while the receptive period of female flowers lasted 30 days. The receptive period of female flowers for the clones in the region of FA BJ and VK started on April 14, while this period started on April 13 for the clones in the region of FA NA. The end of the receptive period for BJ clones was recorded on May 13, for NA clones on April 20, and for VK clones on May 11. The receptive period of BJ female flowers lasted for 29 days, of NA for 9 days, and of VK for 28 days. There were two ""critical"" periods (the first from April 19 to 22, and the other on May 3) during which a sudden termination of receptivity in female flowers was recorded in a great number of clones. During the first period with a more pronounced effect, the termination of receptivity occurred in almost all of the clones within all three CSOs where flowers started to be receptive before April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers in all of the clones that stopped being receptive in this period amounted to 4.2 days. In the second and less pronounced period, there was a termination of receptivity of female flowers in a half of VK clones, whose receptivity mostly began after April 22. The average duration of the receptive period of female flowers, where clones stopped being receptive after May 3, amounted to 9.2 days. Considering the duration of the receptive period of female flowers, statistically significant difference has been determined among the clones whose receptivity of female flowers ended before April 22 and the clones whose female flowers stopped being receptive after April 22. The above-mentioned critical periods occurred in both cases after a sudden drop in the relative humidity of air, which was recorded on April 19 and 29, and low values of minimum air temperatures, which were recorded on April 19, 28 and 29. Shortly before or during the occurrence of ""critical"" periods, precipitation was also recorded. The shedding of pollen started on April 19 for the clones in the region of FA BJ and NA, while the clones in the region of FA VK started shedding pollen on April 15. BJ clones stopped shedding pollen on May 20, NA clones on May 3, and VK clones on May 13. Pollen shedding lasted 31 days in BJ clones, 14 days in NA clones, and 28 days in VK clones. Similarly to the receptivity of female flowers, two ""critical"" periods, when a significant number of clones stopped shedding pollen, can also be noted (the first from April 27 to 29, and the second on May 10). During the first period, most of the NA clones stopped shedding pollen. During the second period, a sudden halt in shedding pollen was recorded in almost all VK clones that started shedding pollen after May 3. The duration of pollen shedding does not differ with respect to ""critical"" periods when cessation of shedding occurred, and it amounts to 5.6 days for all the clones, on average. The abovementioned ""critical"" periods, in both cases connected with shedding of pollen, occurred during a period with high temperatures and low relative humidity of air, without precipitation. Phenological synchronization of flowering is the result of bud-burst synchronization in clones within CSOs and weather conditions, at the moment of receptivity of female flowers and shedding of pollen. In that respect, a combination of phenological synchronization of flowering and unfavorable weather conditions, which caused the sudden termination and short receptive period of female flowers, was most drastically reflected through the clones from CSO NA. Only a smaller number of clones from CSO NA could have participated in mutual pollination in 2010, while in CSOs VK and BJ most of the clones had this opportunity thanks to the unsynchronized bud burst, which had in turn enabled a number of clones to avoid unfavorable weather conditions. Based on the comparison between an average number of days that clones needed to enter each of the studied phenophases of flushing and flowering, it has been determined that the onset of the receptive period of female flowers occurred almost at the same time with phenophase of flushing L4 (first leaves are developed still mostly in the bud), the onset of pollen shedding, and the termination of receptive period of female flowers at the same time with phenophase L6 (the leaves are formed but still longitudinally curved), while the flushing phenophase L7 (the leaves are fully formed and smooth) coincided with the termination of receptivity of female flowers. The results showed that the phenological synchronization of flowering in 2010 was significantly affected by unfavorable weather conditions, which shortened the duration of the receptive period of female flowers to a greater degree, while they had no significant effect on the duration of pollen shedding period. Such course of events most severely affected the clones originating from CSO NA, which had started the period of receptivity of female flowers and pollen shedding of male flowers approximately at the sonic time, in contrast to the clones originating from CSOs Vinkovci and Bjelovar, which started their receptive periods of female flowers and pollen shedding periods of male flowers at different times. pedunculate oak; clonal seed orchard; meteorological data; pollination; protogyny; receptivity;nan","Addressing Social-Ecological Systems across Temporal and Spatial Scales: a Conceptual Synthesis for Ethnobiology We develop an integrative conceptual framework for addressing social-ecological systems across different spatial and temporal scales. Ethnobiologists study social-ecological systems through the lens of heterogeneous disciplines from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. Despite the integrative ambitions of the field, ethnobiology often remains fragmented through research programs that emphasize different methods and scales. We propose a conceptual synthesis of three processes: (1) cognitive processing, (2) cultural transmission, and (3) biocultural evolution. We also discuss how social negotiation is embedded in them. By showing how these different processes interact across different spatial and temporal scales, we develop a framework for ethnobiological scholarship that can address complex dynamics in social-ecological systems.

Public policy scholars have recently suggested to study such attempts by conceptualizing policy integration as a multi-dimensional process. Although such a processual perspective has helped to comparatively assess policy (dis)integration, the mechanisms of (dis)integration over time remain undertheorized. Past studies have reported a number of relevant factors, but these have remained rather functionalistic observations that lack explanatory value. To address this gap, we propose a mechanism-based approach that uncovers the political processes that underlie policy (dis)integration over time. Rooted in different strands of social science literature, the mechanistic approach offers a model of causation to assess the plausible chain of key processes that are triggered under particular contextual conditions. We illustrate the framework by empirically investigating the mechanisms that explain the policy (dis)integration of food and climate change adaptation policy in the Netherlands. We end the paper with discussing various implications of our findings for processual approaches to policy integration.

Higher perceived and objective capacities generate greater total adaptive capacity. This article assesses the perceived adaptive capacity of the Kashechewan First Nation, located in the flood-prone southwestern James Bay (Subarctic) region in Canada. The community is frequently disrupted by the elevated risk of spring flooding and has experienced five major floods since its establishment in 1957. Residents have been evacuated 14 times since 2004 because of actual flooding or flooding risk and potential dike failure. We surveyed 90 residents using 21 indicators to assess the community's perceived adaptive capacity. The results indicate that residents' risk perception and perceived adaptive capacity are high and are reshaping their adaptive behavior to the hazard of spring flooding. The strong positive interrelationships between human capital, social capital, governance, and other determinants, such as migration, personal resilience, and experience, also suggest high perceived adaptive capacity. Human capital and the other determinants are relatively higher contributors to the perceived adaptive capacity, followed by social capital and governance determinants. The results also indicate that residents' disaster preparedness has also improved. The elevated flooding risk and frequently occurring emergencies have motivated the First Nation to modify their spontaneous and proactive adaptation responses for disaster risk reduction at the individual, household, and band levels. Planning to adapt to natural hazards to mitigate their impacts also requires a nuanced understanding of the perceived adaptive capacity that contributes to overall adaptive capacity. Translating the high perceived adaptive capacity into greater total adaptive capacity would contribute to enhancing community resilience.

Yet evidence supporting the wide range of assertions about the outcomes of social learning processes is insufficient. More work is needed to understand when and how a social learning-oriented approach is effective. We respond to the gap in evidence by piloting the Climate Change and Social Learning initiative's monitoring and evaluation framework for social learning. Our objectives are to begin building an evidence base and to test the theory of change behind the framework. Using a peer-assist approach, we apply the framework to eight case studies in partnership with five initiatives. We analyse trends in evidence gathered across the case studies in four dimensions of social learning (engagement, iterative learning, capacity development, and challenging institutions) along three dimensions of change (process, learning outcomes, and changes in values and practice). social learning; climate change adaptation; food security; monitoring and evaluation;ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; PUBLIC-PARTICIPATION; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; GOVERNANCE; INSIGHTS; OUTCOMES; SPACES","Variability and time series trend analysis of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia: A case study in Woleka sub-basin Examining the spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables in the context of changing climate, particularly in countries where rainfed agriculture is predominant, is vital to assess climate-induced changes and suggest feasible adaptation strategies. To that end, trend analysis has been employed to inspect the change of rainfall and temperature in northcentral Ethiopia using gridded monthly precipitation data obtained from Global Precipitation and Climate Centre (GPCC V7) and temperature data from Climate Research Unit (CRU TS 3.23) with 0.5 degrees by 0.5 degrees resolution from 1901 to 2014. Data have been analyzed using coefficient of variation, anomaly index, precipitation concentration index and Palmer drought severity index. Furthermore, Mann-Kendall test was used to detect the time series trend. The result revealed intra-and inter-annual variability of rainfall while Palmer drought severity index value proved the increasing trend of the number of drought years. Annual, belg and kiremt rainfall have decreased with a rate of 15.03, 1.93 and 13.12mm per decade respectively. The declining trend for annual and kiremt rainfall was found to be statistically significant while that of belg was not significant. The rate of change of temperature was found to be 0.046, 0.067 and 0.026 degrees C per decade for mean, minimum and maximum respectively. The Mann-Kendall trend analysis test result revealed increasing trend for mean and minimum average temperatures through time significantly while the trend for maximum temperature exhibited a non-significant increasing trend. We recommend strategies designed in the agricultural sector have to take the declining and erratic nature of rainfall and increasing trend of temperature into consideration.

We investigate three factors - values, motivations and formative experiences - that underlie such behaviour, but that usually have been considered in isolation from each other. In contrast to previous studies of environmentalists' significant life experiences, outdoor/nature experiences were not frequently mentioned as being influential. Altruistic concerns about climate change impacts on future human generations and on poorer or more vulnerable people were considered more motivating than other reasons for action. There was no significant difference in how respondents rated altruistic and biospheric values. Variations in responses from those involved in 'biospherically-oriented' organisations (such as traditional environmental or conservation organisations) versus those involved in climate change groups suggest that there are different routes into climate change mitigation action, and our results show that it is not essential to cultivate biospheric values or the love of nature to encourage such action.

However, inventors from industrialized countries often refuse technology transfer because they worry about reverse-engineering. When can clean technology transfer succeed? We develop a formal model of the political economy of North-South technology transfer. According to the model, technology transfer is possible if (1) the technology in focus has limited global commercial potential or (2) the host developing country does not have the capacity to absorb new technologies for commercial use. If both conditions fail, inventors from industrialized countries worry about the adverse competitiveness effects of reverse-engineering, so technology transfer fails. Data analysis of technology transfer in 4,894 projects implemented under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism during the 2004-2010 period provides evidence in support of the model. ","The bicycle as 'constructive hope': Children, climate and active transport Children are experiencing an increase in so-called 'eco-anxiety'. Along with others, we argue that children need more concrete, meaningful opportunities to feel they can make a difference in climate. In this article, we contend that bringing back the bicycle, and the opportunities for independent and active mobility that it affords children, is an important form of climate action for young people. We assert that as well as providing sustainability and wellbeing co-benefits for children, cycling can help bolster the neighbourhood resilience and social cohesion that will be key resources for communities adapting to new climate risks. nan;MODE","Abrupt behaviors of the streamflow of the Pearl River basin and implications for hydrological alterations across the Pearl River Delta, China In this study, we analyze the long streamflow series of three hydrological stations of the lower Pearl River basin and the streamflow ratio between Makou and Sanshui stations by using statistical techniques. Furthermore, we also attempt to address influences of precipitation and human activities (human-induced deepening of river channels) on streamflow ratio. The results indicate that: (1) the streamflow variations show remarkable relations with precipitation changes in West and East River basins, implying tremendous influences of climate changes on hydrological processes. Decreasing precipitation was observed in North River basin. However, the streamflow, amount of the Sanshui station largely increased due to enlarged streamflow allocation from the West River to the North River; (2) increasing streamflow ratio of Sanshui/(Makou + Sanshui) is the result of morphological changes (downcut) of river channels in the upper Pearl River Delta. The fast downcut of river channels is mainly due to intensive sand mining. Larger magnitude of increase in streamflow ratio corresponds well to the higher intensity of in-channel sand dredging; (3) after late-1990s, decreasing precipitation of the Pearl River basin abates the streamflow amount and also the streamflow ratio. The influences of human activities and climate changes are varying in different time intervals and in different river basins. Due to tremendous impacts of increased streamflow ratio between Sanshui and Makou station. relations between streamflow and precipitation relations in the North River basin are not statistically good. This study helps to improve understandings of the causes underlying altered streamflow variations in the lower Pearl River basin and the hydrological alterations within the Pearl River Delta region.

Wetlands have the functions of ecological water storage, water supply, and climate regulation, which plays an indispensable role in global environmental security. The Pumqu River Basin (PRB) is located in an area with extremely vulnerable ecological environment, where climate change is obvious. Understanding wetland distribution, changes and causes in the PRB are of great importance to the rational management and protection of wetlands. Using the Landsat series satellite images, wetlands of this area in 2000, 2010, and 2018 were extracted. The results showed that (1) there were obvious regional differences in wetland types and their distribution patterns in the basin. Wetlands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes less than 12 degrees and at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m. (2) During the past 20 years, the wetland area in the basin decreased, and the changing trend of wetlands was different. Palustrine wetlands decreased tremendously, riverine and lacustrine wetlands first decreased and then increased, while floodplain wetlands first increased and then decreased. Palustrine wetlands were reclaimed to cultivated land, but the proportion of reclamation is small. (3) Climate dominated wetland changes in the PRB. The changes in riverine and lacustrine wetlands were mainly affected by the warm-season average temperature, the change in palustrine wetlands was mainly related to the annual precipitation and the warm-season average temperature, and the change in floodplain wetlands was related to the warm-season precipitation. To achieve sustainable development, the government plays a guiding role and actively formulates and implements wetland protection policies, such as restricting or prohibiting grazing on wetlands, which play an important role in wetland protection and restoration. wetland changes; climate change; the Pumqu River Basin; Tibetan Plateau; reclamation;ZOIGE PLATEAU; HYDROLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; RIPARIAN VEGETATION; ALPINE WETLANDS; NATURE-RESERVE; WATER-BALANCE; LAKE CHANGES; RIVER-BASIN; LONG-TERM; CHINA","Analysis of agro-climatic parameters and their influence on maize production in South Africa This study analyzed the variability of the agro-climatic parameters that impact maize production across different seasons in South Africa. To achieve this, four agro-climatic variables (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, minimum, and maximum temperatures) were considered for the period spanning 1986-2015, covering the North West, Free State, Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provinces. Results illustrate that there is a negative trend in precipitation for North West and Free State provinces and positive trend in maximum temperature for all the provinces over the study period. Furthermore, the results showed that among other agro-climatic parameters, minimum temperature had the most influence on maize production in North West, potential evapotranspiration (combination of the agro-climatic parameters), minimum and maximum temperature influenced maize production in KZN while maximum temperature influenced maize production in Mpumalanga and Free State. In general, the agro-climatic parameters were found to contribute 7.79, 21.85, 32.52, and 44.39% to variation in maize production during the study period in North West, Free State, Mpumalanga, and KZN, respectively. The variation in maize production among the provinces under investigation could most likely attribute to the variation in the size of the cultivated land among other factors including soil type and land tenure system. There were also difference in yield per hectare between the provinces; KZN and Mpumalanga being located in the humid subtropical areas of South Africa had the highest yield per hectare 5.61 and 4.99tons, respectively, while Free State and North West which are in the semi-arid region had the lowest yield per hectare 3.86 and 3.03tons, respectively. Understanding the nature and interaction of the dominant agro-climatic parameters discussed in the present study as well as their impact on maize production will help farmers and agricultural policy makers to understand how climate change exerts its influence on maize production within the study area so as to better adapt to the major climate element that either increases or decreases maize production in their respective provinces. nan;agricultural application; agrometeorology; climate effect; crop production; crop yield; evapotranspiration; maize; regional climate; Free State; KwaZulu-Natal; Mpumalanga; North West Province; South Africa; Zea mays","Measuring the long-term success of small-scale marine protected areas in a Philippine reef fishery Tropical coral reefs are subject to multiple pressures from both natural and anthropogenic sources. These pressures have caused widespread declines in reef health, resulting in the increased use of spatial management tools such as marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs have proven generally effective if well designed and enforced, but there are limited long-term studies investigating how the presence of small-scale MPAs affects fish populations and reef communities. Using a 12-year time series, we found that small-scale (10-50 ha) community-managed MPAs along the Danajon Bank of the Philippines preserved average fish biomass within their boundaries over time relative to surrounding fished reefs. Unprotected areas are, however, showing significant long-term biomass decline. MPAs were also found to preserve more key trophic groups and larger-bodied commercially targeted reef fish families. Fish biomass of piscivore, scavenger and invertivore trophic groups inside individual MPAs is, however, still declining at a similar rate as outside. Surprisingly, long-term benthic cover and growth form composition were not significantly affected overall by MPA presence, despite the sporadic use of highly destructive dynamite fishing in this region. Coral cover has remained historically low (21-28%) throughout the study, following widespread bleaching mortality. While management tempered overall abundance declines, we found that irrespective of MPA presence, there was a generalised decline of both large- and small-bodied fish size groups across the study region, most steeply within the 20-30 cm length fish, and a shift towards proportionally higher abundances of small (5-10 cm) fish. This indicates a combination of over-exploitation, inadequate MPA size and coverage for larger fish, and the lingering effects of the 1998 bleaching event. Generalised shifts in body size and trophic structure reported here could lead to future reductions in fishery productivity and stability and will be further exacerbated unless broader fishery regulations and enforcement is instated.

A concern with the mitigation of climate change cuts a transversal line across economic agents, epitomized by two contradictory viewpoints. Some defend that green growth can be achieved without harming economic growth; others argue that it is not possible to respect sustainability if intensive consumption of goods continues to foster economic growth. Our research aims to analyze the role that sustainable technology transfer and sustainable innovations play in green growth and ascertain the impact of green growth on economic growth. We use aggregated country-level data provided by the OECD, including national accounts, population, and environment statistics (including patents) between 1990 and 2013 for 32 countries, corresponding to an unbalanced panel of 591 observations. We estimate econometric models based on dynamic panel methodologies to capture differences that exist over time. The results show that sustainable technology transfer and sustainable innovation promote green growth, which in turn positively impacts economic growth. We contribute new insight to the green growth versus economic growth debate and provide several political and management implications. ","Flood Wave Superposition Analysis Using Quantitative Matching Patterns of Peak Magnitude and Timing in Response to Climate Change Flood wave superposition (FWS) of upstream and tributary rivers, as a typical compound hydrological event, may lead to considerable downstream flood hazards. In spite of this, the quantitative identification of FWS classification so far remains elusive. In this study, we quantitatively examined the typical matching patterns of FWS based on flood peak magnitude and timing between the upstream and tributary discharge, to evaluate the flood severity for both present-day conditions and future climate projections. The future FWS projection was realized using hydrological modeling coupled with multiple outputs of global climate models (GCMs) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios. A triple point of discharge stations, including upstream, downstream and tributary stations, located at a river confluence of the Poyang Lake Basin, China, was selected as the study area. The results revealed that the frequency of perfect temporal matching (0-day time lag) of projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods increased from 61% in the reference period to >68% and > 66% in the future under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, respectively. Furthermore, both the future numbers and frequencies of the projected peaks between upstream and tributary floods with both perfect temporal and magnitude matching (the classification associated with the most damage in FWS) would substantially increase across all GCMs under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5. These findings indicate that future FWS is expected to experience increasing severity due to the changing climate under no matter RCP 2.6 or 8.5 emission scenarios. Overall, it is suggested that effective adaptation strategies be developed in order to stagger the timing of upstream and tributary floods in the future.

On democratisation of science and social accounts of objectivity This article focuses on epistemic challenges related to the democratisation of scientific knowledge production, and to the limitations of current social accounts of objectivity. A process of 'democratisation' can be observed in many scientific and academic fields today. Collaboration with extra-academic agents and the use of extra-academic expertise and knowledge has become common, and researchers are interested in promoting socially inclusive research practices. As this development is particularly prevalent in policy-relevant research, it is important that the new, more democratic forms of research be objective. In social accounts of objectivity only epistemic communities are taken to be able to produce objective knowledge, or the entity whose objectivity is to be assessed is precisely such a community. As I argue, these accounts do not allow for situations where it is not easy to identify the relevant epistemic community. Democratisation of scientific knowledge production can lead to such situations. As an example, I discuss attempts to link indigenous oral traditions to floods and tsunamis that happened hundreds or even thousands of years ago.

In southern Europe, post-flowering phases of the growth cycle can occur under high temperatures, excessive light, and drought conditions at soil and/or atmospheric level. In this study, we subjected greenhouse grown grapevine, variety Aragonez, to two individual abiotic stresses, water deficit stress (WDS), and heat stress (HS). The adaptation of plants to stress is a complex response triggered by cascades of molecular networks involved in stress perception, signal transduction, and the expression of specific stress-related genes and metabolites. Approaches such as array-based transcript profiling allow assessing the expression of thousands of genes in control and stress tissues. Using microarrays, we analyzed the leaf transcriptomic profile of the grapevine plants. Photosynthesis measurements verified that the plants were significantly affected by the stresses applied. Leaf gene expression was obtained using a high-throughput transcriptomic grapevine array, the 23K custom-made Affymetrix Vitis GeneChip. We identified 1,594 genes as differentially expressed between control and treatments and grouped them into ten major functional categories using MapMan software. The transcriptome of Aragonez was more significantly affected by HS when compared with WDS. The number of genes coding for heat-shock proteins and transcription factors expressed solely in response to HS suggesting their expression as unique signatures of HS. However, a cross-talk between the response pathways to both stresses was observed at the level of AP2/ERF transcription factors.

However, neither a circumpolar assessment of AMM status nor a standardized metric of sea ice habitat change is available. We summarized available data on abundance and trend for each AMM species and recognized subpopulation. We also examined species diversity, the extent of human use, and temporal trends in sea ice habitat for 12 regions of the Arctic by calculating the dates of spring sea ice retreat and fall sea ice advance from satellite data (1979-2013). Estimates of AMM abundance varied greatly in quality, and few studies were long enough for trend analysis. Of the AMM subpopulations, 78% (61 of 78) are legally harvested for subsistence purposes. Changes in sea ice phenology have been profound. In all regions except the Bering Sea, the duration of the summer (i.e., reduced ice) period increased by 5-10 weeks and by >20 weeks in the Barents Sea between 1979 and 2013. In light of generally poor data, the importance of human use, and forecasted environmental changes in the 21st century, we recommend the following for effective AMM conservation: maintain and improve comanagement by local, federal, and international partners; recognize spatial and temporal variability in AMM subpopulation response to climate change; implement monitoring programs with clear goals; mitigate cumulative impacts of increased human activity; and recognize the limits of current protected species legislation. Estado de las Poblaciones de Mamiferos Marinos del artico, la Perdida del Habitats de Hielo Marino y Recomendaciones de Conservacion para el Siglo XXI Los mamiferos marinos del artico (MMA) son emblemas del cambio climatico, principalmente por su asociacion cercana con el hielo marino.

En todas las regiones, salvo el Mar de Bering, la duracion del periodo de verano (es decir, la reduccion del hielo) incremento por 5-10 semanas y por >20 semanas en el Mar de Barents entre 1979 y 2013. A razon de los datos generalmente pobres, la importancia del uso por parte de los humanos y los cambios ambientales pronosticados para el Siglo XX1, recomendamos lo siguiente para la conservacion efectiva de los MMA: mantener y mejorar el co-manejo por parte de los socios locales, federales e internacionales; reconocer la variabilidad temporal y espacial en la respuesta de las sub-poblaciones de MMA al cambio climatico; implementar el monitoreo de programas con objetivos claros; mitigar los impactos acumulativos del incremento de la actividad humana; y reconocer los limites de la legislacion actual para las especies protegidas.

Using groundwater as a complimentary source of water has provided an effective means to satisfy the ever-increasing water demands and deal with surface water shortages problems due to robust capability of groundwater in responding to climate change. Conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater is crucial for integrated water resources management. It is helpful to reduce vulnerabilities of water supply systems and mitigate the water supply stress in responding to climate change. Some critical challenges and perspectives are discussed to help decision/policy makers develop more effective management and adaptation strategies for conjunctive water resources use in facing climate change under complex uncertainties. conjunctive water management; surface water; groundwater; hydrology; climate change;LAND-USE CHANGE; RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; CHANGE IMPACTS; HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS; CHANGE UNCERTAINTIES; QUALITY MANAGEMENT; GLOBAL CLIMATE; RIVER-BASIN; VARIABILITY; SYSTEM","13C discriminations of Pinus sylvestris vs. Pinus ponderosa at a dry site in Brandenburg (eastern Germany): 100-year growth comparison The carbon isotope composition (delta C-13, parts per thousand) and discrimination (Delta, ,parts per thousand) of old grown North American Pinus ponderosa Dougl. Ex P. et C. Laws. and European Pinus sylvestris L. were determined using trees grown under almost identical growing conditions in a mixed stand in Bralitz, Northeast Germany. Single-tree delta C-13 analyses of tree-ring cellulose of both species were carried out at a yearly resolution for the period 1901-2001 and the results compared with growth (basal area increment). Annual mean delta C-13 values for P. ponderosa ranged from -21.6 parts per thousand to -25.2 parts per thousand and for P. sylvestris from -21.4 parts per thousand to -24.4 parts per thousand. Accordingly, C-13 discrimination (Delta) showed higher values for P. ponderosa throughout the investigation period. Five characteristic periods of Delta were identified for both the tree species, reflecting positive and negative influences of environmental factors. Good growing conditions such as after-thinning events had a positive effect on Delta, reflecting higher values, while poor conditions like aridity and air pollution had a negative influence, reflecting lower values. The dynamics of Delta were likewise reflected in the growth (basal area increment, BAI). Higher C-13 discrimination values of P. ponderosa led to higher BAIs of P. ponderosa in comparison with P. sylvestris. Correlation function analyses confirmed that P. sylvestris was more dependent on precipitation than P. ponderosa, which showed a closer relationship with temperature. The results confirm that under predominantly dry growing conditions, P. ponderosa showed better growth performance than P. sylvestris, indicating better common intrinsic water-use efficiency and, therefore, higher rates of net photosynthesis at a given transpiration. In view of the prospect of climate change, the results are very significant for assessing both trees' physiological properties and, hence, their potential for coping with future growing conditions. aridity; basal area increment; carbon isotope discrimination; carbon-13; follow-up; growth; Pinus sylvestris; Pinus ponderosa; tree rings;CARBON-ISOTOPE DISCRIMINATION; TREE-RING CELLULOSE; ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATION; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; FRACTIONATION; LEAVES; CHRONOLOGIES; ASSIMILATION","Livestock Production, Rural Poverty, and Perceived Shocks: Evidence from Panel Data for Vietnam This paper assesses the contribution of livestock to reducing rural poverty and examines the determinants of livestock assets with panel data from Vietnam. The findings show that livestock production contributes to reducing poverty and livestock assets are influenced by the number of shocks that households faced during the last three years, access to credits, farmland size, education of household head, irrigation system, and access to the national electricity. We suggest that empowering rural households to better cope with shocks contributes to developing livestock and consequently to reducing rural poverty. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVELIHOODS; CONSUMPTION; HOUSEHOLDS; REDUCTION; HEALTH; DETERMINANTS; ACCUMULATION; INSURANCE; COUNTRIES","Evaluating the Quality and Implementation of Hazard Mitigation Plans in Coastal Washington State Local-level hazard mitigation plans, particularly in coastal areas, are critical to protecting communities from natural hazards, some of which are expected to increase with climate change. However, questions remain with regard to (1) the quality of these plans, (2) the underlying planning processes, and (3) the implementation of planned actions. This study helps to fill these gaps by evaluating hazard mitigation plans from 19 counties in western Washington State, using seven components of plan quality. This evaluation was supplemented with an online survey of 27 hazard planning professionals in these counties, exploring their perceptions of collaboration in the respective planning processes, as well as implementation of the plans. Overall, the plans excel in some components of plan quality (e.g., vision statement) but suggest room for improvement in other components (e.g., policies and actions). Survey results do not provide evidence that more collaborative planning processes yield higher-quality plans in the context of these counties. Additionally, although the plan evaluation finds elements of high-quality plans, the survey identifies barriers to implementation, including deficiencies in funding, coordination, and leadership. nan;COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE; LOCAL PLANS; CONFORMANCE; OUTCOMES; OUTPUTS","A Proposal to Integrate Price Mechanisms into International Climate Negotiations The Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change continue their efforts to forge a new binding international agreement by 2015. This article proposes to adapt international negotiations to allow for hybrid price and quantity-based commitments. The economic risks surrounding target-only commitments-the current approach-are enormous. Combining a clear cumulative emissions target with price-based limits on the cost associated with achieving that target would reduce those risks, ensure that commitments by Parties remain feasible and reduce the chance that the agreement would collapse. Moreover, we argue that adding prices into the agreement offers transparent and verifiable assurance of the comparability of effort across countries. Finally, we also show that it is possible to calculate ` carbon price equivalents' of quantity-based climate commitments in a conceptually similar way to the tariff equivalents used in international trade negotiations. climate policy; uncertainty; price collar; UNFCCC; carbon price equivalence;nan","Drought Propagation in Semi-Arid River Basins in Latin America: Lessons from Mexico to the Southern Cone Detecting droughts as early as possible is important in avoiding negative impacts on economy, society, and environment. To improve drought monitoring, we studied drought propagation (i.e., the temporal manifestation of a precipitation deficit on soil moisture and streamflow). We used the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Standardized Streamflow Index (SSI), and Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSMI) in three drought-prone regions: Sonora (Mexico), Maipo (Chile), and Mendoza-Tunuyan (Argentina) to study their temporal interdependence. For this evaluation we use precipitation, temperature, and streamflow data from gauges that are managed by governmental institutions, and satellite-based soil moisture from the ESA CCI SM v03.3 combined data set. Results confirm that effective drought monitoring should be carried out (1) at river-basin scale, (2) including several variables, and (3) considering hydro-meteorological processes from outside its boundaries. drought assessment; drought propagation; standardized drought indices; semi-arid river basins; Latin-America;STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX; CANDIDATE DISTRIBUTIONS; WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CHILE; ARGENTINA; IMPACTS; CATCHMENT; SNOWPACK; TOOLS","Climate change and global justice In this article, I examine matters concerning justice and climate change in light of current work in global justice. I briefly discuss some of the most important contemporary work by political philosophers and theorist on global justice and relate it to various considerations regarding justice and climate change. After briefly surveying the international treaty context, I critically discuss several issues, including climate change and human rights, responsibility for historical emissions and the polluter-pays principle, the ability to pay principle, grandfathering entitlements to emit greenhouse gasses, equal per capita emissions entitlements, the right to sustainable development, and responsibility for financing adaptation to climate change. This set of issues does not exhaust the list of considerations of global justice and climate change, but it includes some of the most important of those considerations.

Assessing the relative effect of climate change and human activities is essential not only for understanding the mechanism of hydrological response in the catchment, but also for local water resources management. The Kuye river, the first-order tributary of the middle Yellow river, has experienced significant runoff declines. In this study, the characteristics of hydro-climatic changes of the Kuye river catchment were analyzed based on the observed data for the period 1955-2010. Using the monthly climatic and hydrological data, the Yellow river water balance model (YRWBM) is calibrated and verified to a baseline period from 1955 to 1978. Subsequently, natural runoff for human-induced period (1979-1998) and strongly human-induced period (1999-2010) is reconstructed using the YRWBM model without considering local human impacts. Results indicate that the time series of runoff was divided into three periods at two critical years of 1979 and 1998. The YRWBM model performed well in simulating monthly discharges in the catchment, both NSES in calibration and verification were above 70 %, while RES in both periods were at less than 5 %. The absolute runoff reductions induced by climate change and human activities both have been growing. The percentage of runoff reduction attributed to climate variations from 60.56 % in human-induced periods to 43.50 % in strongly human-induced periods. At the same time the percentage of runoff reduction from human activities is from 39.44 % in human-induced periods to 56.50 % in strongly human-induced periods. Thus human activities demonstrated a dominant influence upon runoff decline gradually.

A total of 612 farmers (328 females and 284 males) were interviewed using purposive sampling technique. Our results indicate that adaptation strategies are gendered with men mostly resorting to on-farm agronomic practices such as the use of artificial fertilizers and also moving into new cash crops. Female farmers also use similar on-farm agronomic practices particularly artificial fertilizers to boost crop production but most importantly resorted to petty trading in agricultural and consumable goods, an off-farm strategy. This shows women's resilience which has also subsequently improved their decision-making role at the household level, which is an indicator of empowerment. We recommend that institutions that support climate change adaptation initiatives at the local level must take gender differences into consideration and support particularly women to strengthen their resilience and consolidate their empowerment.

Lighting intensities of the selected areas in the building were measured and thermal images of the building envelope were compared before and after retrofitting. Combustion performance of the boilers was measured and the effects of the insulation on the natural gas consumption were investigated. According to the results, the lighting system renovation decreased the share of lighting in total electricity consumption of the buildings by 53.2% for the recommended lighting intensities in the selected zones. As a result of the lighting system renovation, carbon footprint of the campus decreased 308,715 kgCO(2) per year. Natural gas consumption decreased by 25.3% after building envelope insulation which equals to 137,078 kgCO(2) per year. energy audit; carbon footprint; energy efficiency; lighting; thermal image; building retrofitting; greenhouse gases;PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT; CONSERVATION MEASURES; SIMULATION; METHODOLOGY; EFFICIENCY; HOT; UNIVERSITY; DIAGNOSIS; CLIMATES; PROGRAMS","Unilateral Clean Development Mechanism - An approach for a least developed country? The case of Yemen Decision parameters prevailing in the market lead to a slim expression of interest of foreign investors for Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects in a bi- or multilateral design in Yemen. The Designated National Authority Secretariat in Yemen experiences the preference of Annex I entities of merely buying Certified Emission Reductions rather than investing in projects. Yemen's ability, like many least developed countries, to carry out unilateral CDM projects is moderate. Domestic project developers perceive difficulties in procuring underlying finance as key barrier in materializing CDM project activities in a unilateral design. The country remains trapped in a ""catch 22 situation"". International assistance through low interest loans and capacity building for domestic financial institutions tailored to CDM project activities may trigger the market. Aggravation can be assisted by amending the policies of Annex I countries, in consequence to allocate a substantial share of their procurement activities to Certified Emission Reductions from least developed countries. Acquisition programmes may give preference to projects from host countries not traditionally represented in the pool of attractive CDM destinations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, the Budyko method was used to quantitatively identify the effects of climate conditions and the underlying surface such as topography, land use and vegetation cover on the runoff changes in the Yellow River Basin during 1961-2018, and to clarify the spatial differences in the sensitivity and attribution of the runoff evolution by dividing the entire basin into sub-basins. The results show that the runoff was more sensitive to the underlying surface and precipitation changes than to the potential evapo-ration. The sensitivity coefficients decreased from upstream to downstream and the aridity index increased. The contribution rates of the climatic and the underlying surface changes to the runoff changes were 10.3-36.8% and 62.9-88.7%, respectively, and the underlying surface changes were the dominant factor causing the decrease in the runoff. Climate change led to increased runoff in the upper reaches and decreased runoff in the middle and lower reaches; while the underlying surface changes led to decreased runoff throughout the entire basin, especially in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. The quantified spatial differences in the runoff evolution attribution can help improve regional water resource management and provide theoretical support for studying the water cycle evolution mechanism in the Yellow River Basin.

The soil quality is deteriorating at an alarming rate in the neighborhood of smelters as a result of heavy metal deposition. Organic biowastes, also produced through anthropogenic activities, provide some solutions for remediation and management of degraded soils through their use as a substrate. Biowastes, due to their high content of organic compounds, have the potential to improve soil quality, plant productivity, and microbial activity contributing to higher humus production. Biowaste use also leads to the immobilization and stabilization of heavy metals, carbon sequestration, and release of macro and micronutrients. Increased carbon sequestration through biowaste use helps us in mitigating climate change and global warming. Soil amendment by biowaste increases soil activity and plant productivity caused by stimulation in shoot and root length, biomass production, grain yield, chlorophyll content, and decrease in oxidative stress. However, biowaste application to soils is a debatable issue due to their possible negative effect of high heavy metal concentration and risks of their accumulation in soils. Therefore, regulations for the use of biowastes as fertilizer or soil amendment must be improved and strictly employed to avoid environmental risks and the entry of potentially toxic elements into the food chain. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the effects of biowastes on soil remediation, plant productivity, and soil organic carbon sequestration. soil remediation; soil carbon sequestration; plant productivity; biowaste; circular economy; sewage sludge; biosolids; regulations; soil degraded; soil revegetation;SEWAGE-SLUDGE APPLICATION; MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; HEAVY-METALS; ROTHC MODEL; DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; CONTAMINATED SOIL; CROP PRODUCTION","Towards Sustainable Shifts to Healthy Diets and Food Security in Sub-Saharan Africa with Climate-Resilient Crops in Bread-Type Products: A Food System Analysis Massive urbanization and increasing disposable incomes favor a rapid transition in diets and lifestyle in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). As a result, the SSA population is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the double burden of malnutrition and obesity. This, combined with the increasing pressure to produce sufficient food and provide employment for this growing population together with the threat of climate change-induced declining crop yields, requires urgent sustainable solutions. Can an increase in the cultivation of climate-resilient crops (CRCs) and their utilization to produce attractive, convenient and nutritious bread products contribute to climate change adaptation and healthy and sustainable diets? A food system analysis of the bread food value chain in SSA indicates that replacement of refined, mostly imported, wheat in attractive bread products could (1) improve food and nutrition security, (2) bring about a shift to more nutritionally balanced diets, (3) increase economic inclusiveness and equitable benefits, and (4) improve sustainability and resilience of the food system. The food system analysis also provided systematic insight into the challenges and hurdles that need to be overcome to increase the availability, affordability and uptake of CRCs. Proposed interventions include improving the agronomic yield of CRCs, food product technology, raising consumer awareness and directing policies. Overall, integrated programs involving all stakeholders in the food system are needed.

In the present study, we address those factors regulating dormancy responses as part of a 'longer strategy' to persist and thrive in temperate environments, focusing on Rhagoletis cerasi, a univoltine, oligophagous species, which overwinters as pupae and emerges when host fruits are available for oviposition at local scale. To ensure population survival and reproduction at habitats with ecological heterogeneity, R. cerasi has evolved a sophisticated diapause strategy based on a combination of local adaptation and diversified bet-hedging strategies. Diapause duration is determined both by (i) the adaptive response to local host fruit phenology patterns (annual diapause) and (ii) the plastic responses to unpredictable inter-annual (temporal) climatic variability that drives a proportion of the populations to extend dormancy by entering a second, successive, facultative cycle of prolonged diapause as part of a bet-hedging strategy. Besides the dormant periods, post-diapause development (which varies among populations) exerts 'fine tune' adjustments that assure synchronization and may correct possible errors. Adults emerging from pupae with prolonged diapause are larger in body size compared with counterparts emerging during the first year of diapause. However, female fecundity rates are reduced, followed by an extended post-oviposition period, whereas adult longevity remains unaffected. Overall, it appears that R. cerasi populations are adapted to ecological conditions of local habitats and respond plastically to unpredictable environmental (climatic) conditions.

This study looked at heavy metal concentrations, concentrations in relation to threshold values, and assessments of risk for noncarcinogenic and cancer risk threat. The Microwave Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (MP-AES 4210) series instrument of Agilent Technology, United States of America (USA), was used in analyzing heavy metal (Cd, Cu, and Pb) concentrations. The result of the analysis of the Kuka Bulukiya treatment point revealed that Pb has the highest mean concentration of 0.0693 ppm, Cu 0.0525 parts per million (PPM), and Cd 0.0042 ppm. The mean concentration at PRP Gidan Ruwa for Cd was found to be 0.0059 ppm, Cu 0.0363 ppm, and Pb 0.049 ppm. The result of the adult and children population calculated shows that the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) values are not up to 1 in all the pathways (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal) at both treatment points (1.2 x 10(-4) and 9.8 x 10(-5)) and (6.4 x 10(-4) and 5.9 x 10(-4)), respectively. The cancer risk for Kuka Bulukiya 6 x 10(-)(10) and PRP G/Ruwa 5 x 10(-)(10) for adults and 7 x 10(-)(10) and 4 x 10(-)(10) for children were both lower than the threshold set for cancer risk by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This meant that both adults and children were not at risk of cancer and noncarcinogenic threat based on the assessment in this study. The study concluded that informal e-waste burning has substantially helped in the relatively high levels of air pollution identified in the treatment points and in turn posed environmental and public health concerns to people around the area. This study recommends that samples of the vegetable products at the PRP G/Ruwa treatment point should be investigated immediately and adequate restrictions and regulations should be enacted and enforced in order to safeguard the environment and the populace. There is need for caution from the authorities to avert the possible implications (e-waste extractors and the public) of being affected with noncarcinogenic or carcinogenic ailments over time.

Therefore, policy responses need to deal with diverse issues, including sustainable development (SD), adaptation to climate change, and humanitarian assistance, to address the future challenges posed by climate change and consequent human displacement. There is no simple and straightforward solution to the challenges posed by climate-induced migration, and a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach will not effectively resolve the complex nature, and patterns, of population displacement. Rather than any single approach, a multifarious, comprehensive, proactive, and coherent policy approach is imperative for managing climate- induced migration in an orderly and humane manner. Based on the available data regarding the environment, climate change, and migration, this paper suggests a range of policy tools and approaches. It also sets out a road map showing how policy interventions could contribute to better integrating the full spectrum of migration issues and concerns into an overall environmental and developmental policy, and vice versa, within Bangladesh. climate change; human migration; Bangladesh; legal framework; legal reform;nan","Trends and Evolution in the Concept of Marine Ecosystem Services: An Overview The biotic and abiotic assets of the marine environment form the ""marine natural capital"" embedded in the global ocean. Marine natural capital provides the flow of ""marine ecosystem services"" that are directly used or enjoyed by people providing benefits to human well-being. They include provisioning services (e.g., food), regulation and maintenance services (e.g., carbon sequestration and storage, and coastal protection), and cultural services (e.g., tourism and recreational benefits). In recent decades, human activities have increased the pressures on marine ecosystems, often leading to ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and, in turn, affecting their ability to provide benefits to humans. Therefore, effective management strategies are crucial to the conservation of healthy and diverse marine ecosystems and to ensuring their long-term generation of goods and services. Biophysical, economic, and sociocultural assessments of marine ecosystem services are much needed to convey the importance of natural resources to managers and policy makers supporting the development and implementation of policies oriented for the sustainable management of marine resources. In addition, the accounting of marine ecosystem service values can be usefully complemented by their mapping to enable the identification of priority areas and management strategies and to facilitate science-policy dialogue. Given this premise, this study aims to review trends and evolution in the concept of marine ecosystem services. In particular, the global scientific literature on marine ecosystem services is explored by focusing on the following main aspects: the definition and classification of marine ecosystem services; their loss due to anthropogenic pressures, alternative assessment, and mapping approaches; and the inclusion of marine ecosystem services into policy and decision-making processes. marine ecosystems; ecosystem services; benefits to humans; biophysical assessment; economic valuation;CLIMATE-CHANGE; DECISION-MAKING; COASTAL; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES; SUPPORT; FLOWS","Adaptation and the Allocation of Pollution Reduction Costs We consider a game of abatement of a transboundary pollutant. We use a time-consistent Shapley value allocation of the cost of pollution reduction, and study the sensitivity of such an allocation to countries' adaptation to pollution. A country's adaptation to pollution is captured by a change in its damage function. We show that if there is a reduction in the damage cost of one country only, this can harm the other countries. Some countries may end up worse off even in the case where all countries experience a uniform decrease in their damage from pollution. An important policy implication of our analysis is that the Shapley value approach to the allocation of abatement costs does not necessarily provide the right incentives for all players to act on reducing pollution damage. We determine conditions under which a uniform fall in all countries' pollution damage benefits all countries.

Climate communication does not begin by considering how projected climate change influences long-term investments for infrastructure planning, or what far-sighted policy can manage social and environmental change. When centred on useful application, climate change communication begins by considering what information is already known and what drives the need for new knowledge. Traditionally driven by scientists, communicating what is known about climate change is increasingly influenced by the decision-makers who will use this information. Better understanding is needed of the ways in which existing and new mechanisms develop observations and analytic outputs to become the knowledge needed, especially considering the limits of what can be known. How information is derived influences how it can be communicated, from numeric model outputs to scenario visualizations. By involving stakeholders in both generating and communicating climate information from its initial development, many more actors can consider when, and how, to use knowledge of climate change. ","Complex adaptive systems engineering and risk reduction Complex adaptive systems are central to many persistent problems locally and globally. In cases where the effects of a policy play out slowly and propagate through interdependencies with other systems, the broader view and understanding gained from complex adaptive system analyses allow us to recognise the causal relationships involved and solve persistent system-level issues. This is particularly true with the risks due to climate change, economic crises, energy disruptions and food insecurity. Climate change and the challenge of addressing the resulting global risks provides a common set of problems on which to build a global community of practice that utilises earth systems' engineering approaches and sustainability goals to understand and resolve problems in complex adaptive systems of systems. Structural adaptation under environmental stress, simple rules for entity interactions and condition-dependent behaviours are key attributes of complex systems. These attributes provide the means for creating models that behave the way the real system does and for the same reasons, improving understanding and designing effective solutions. This paper presents general concepts for infrastructure adaptation and examples of successful applications of an expanded engineering process for complex systems of systems. dynamics; infrastructure planning; sustainability;nan","Silviculture of South American temperate native forests Background: South America has the largest area of temperate forests in the Southern Hemisphere, which grow in diverse site conditions. The aim of this paper is to review the practices of silviculture applied and recommended for these temperate forests, and to discuss prospects to develop new silvicultural proposals to improve sustainability, adaptation and in-situ conservation of forest ecosystems. Methods: We reviewed the silviculture knowledge in four major forest types: 1) The Nothofagus-dominated forests of south-central Chile; 2) the Angiosperm-dominated evergreen forests; 3) the Nothofagus and Austrocedrus chilensis (D.Don) Pic. Serm. & Bizzarri forests in the Argentinean Northern Patagonia; and 4) the Cool temperate Nothofagus forests and Magellanic rainforests. Results: In Chile, both Nothofagus-dominated and Angiosperm-dominated evergreen forests are diverse in tree species, and mixed-species silviculture with commercially valuable species of variable shade tolerance is most promising. Some secondary forests can reach growth rates as high as 20 m(3)ha(-1)yr(-1). After thinnings, stands with 35-60% of residual densities have shown the best responses in growth. Even-aged silvicultural methods have shown a rapid reorganization and development of new cohorts, although, where Chusquea species are conspicuous, regeneration establishment requires controlling competing vegetation. Preliminary results also show interesting prospects for single-tree selection cuts in uneven-aged forests. East of the Andes, in Argentina, mixed Nothofagus forests and pure and mixed Nothofagus and A. chilensis forests occur. The shelterwood method has been the most practised and successful in the mixed Nothofagus forests, with abundant regeneration, and good growth rates. For A. chilensis forests, an adaptive management approach is proposed, conditioned by the cypress disease attack (e.g., Phytophthora austrocedri). Conversion of pure A. chilensis to mixed A. chilensis-N. dombeyi forests could increase growth considerably. Finally, in the cool temperate Nothofagus forests and Magellanic rainforests, shared by Chile and Argentina, the regular shelterwood cuts have been the most common silvicultural method, with massive regeneration a decade after the regeneration felling. Since the two major Nothofagus species in these forests regenerate well in gaps, uneven-aged silviculture seems also promising. Conclusions: There is abundant knowledge about the silviculture of these forest types. However, there are opportunities for several silvicultural systems to better contribute to sustainable forest management, reverse forest degradation, and cope with climate change challenges, primarily through developing mixed and single-species productive and carbon-rich forests, with greater adaptive capacity.

The ideas shared are based on a keynote address given by the author at the International Conference on Climate Change, Indigenous Resilience and Local Knowledge Systems: Cross-time and Cross-boundary Perspectives held at the National Taiwan University on 13-14 December 2019. The primary audience for this essay is Indigenous Peoples and allies of Indigenous Peoples who are actively involved in climate change studies, sustainable community building, and education. As such, it presents the author's personal view of key orientations for shifting current paradigms by introducing an Indigenized conceptual framework of community building which can move Indigenous communities toward revitalization and renewal through strategically implementing culturally responsive Indigenous science education, engaging sustainable economics and sustainability studies. As an Indigenous scholar who has maintained an insider perspective and has worked extensively with community members around issues of culturally responsive science education, the author challenges all concerned to take Indigenous science seriously as an ancient body of applied knowledge for sustaining communities and ensuring survival over time and through generations. The author also challenges readers to initiate new thinking about how to use Indigenous science, community building, and education as a tool and a body of knowledge which may be integrated with appropriate forms of Western science in new and creative ways that serve to sustain and ensure survival rather than perpetuate unexamined Western business paradigms of community development.

In small-scale and medium-scale reservoir-based irrigation schemes in the Upper East region of Ghana, we explored options for improving the traditional, dry season irrigation practices and assessed the potential for supplemental irrigation in the rainy season. The AquaCrop model was used to (i) assess current water management in the typical tomato-maize rotational system; (ii) develop an improved irrigation schedule for dry season cultivation of tomato; and (iii) determine the requirement for supplemental irrigation of maize in the rainy season under different climate scenarios. The improved irrigation schedule for dry season tomato cultivation would result in a water saving of 130-1325 mm compared to traditional irrigation practices, accompanied by approximately a 4-14% increase in tomato yield. The supplemental irrigation of maize would require 107-126 mm of water in periods of low rainfall and frequent dry spells, and 88-105 mm in periods of high rainfall and rare dry spells. Therefore, year-round irrigated crop production may be feasible, using water saved during dry season tomato cultivation for supplemental irrigation of maize in the rainy season.

However, as vulnerability varies spatially and is effected by the bio-geographical conditions, the information on vulnerability distribution among the different biogeographic zones (BZs) is of value. This study aims to assess impact of social and ecological dimensions on vulnerability of agricultural communities in different biogeographical zones of Himalaya. Inherent vulnerability in different BZs was assessed at village level by performing hierarchal additive clustering. A total of 39 indicators (16 for ecological and 23 for social) were considered and weighed by Analytical Hierarchal Process (AHP). The spatial distribution of different vulnerability indices was analyzed by Global and Local Moran's Index. The results show presence of very high social vulnerability (0.71 +/- 0.11) for middle Himalayas (BZ2) and higher ecological vulnerability (0.68 +/- 0.13) for lower Himalayas (BZ1). Among the different zones, middle Himalayas (BZ2) shows the maximum inherent vulnerability. The present study aids the policy-makers and stakeholders in identifying the regions requiring immediate intervention. The study also highlights the factors among social or ecological dimensions which require greater attention than others.

Both the direct and flow-on effects of climate change place children at risk of mental health consequences including PTSD, depression, anxiety, phobias, sleep disorders, attachment disorders, and substance abuse. These in turn can lead to problems with emotion regulation, cognition, learning, behavior, language development, and academic performance. Together, these create predispositions to adverse adult mental health outcomes. Children also exhibit high levels of concern over climate change. Meaning-focused coping promotes well-being and environmental engagement. Both direct and indirect climate change impacts affect children's psychological well-being. Children in the developing world will suffer the worst impacts. Mental health professionals have important roles in helping mitigate climate change, and researching and implementing approaches to helping children cope with its impacts.

Economic activity and habitation are mostly limited to this developed ribbon. As the polar ice retreats and better ships and remote sensing are being developed, the habitable edge of the world is moving ever farther into the Arctic, leading to the emergence of a new spatial structure of Earth: the semiglobe. In a semiglobe system, the Arctic is no longer the most remote area of Earth but is its center. The practical consequences of polar ice retreat are notably Arctic resource development and Arctic shipping routes. The largest impact on global marine transportation occurs as all-year shipping develops in the Arctic, eventually leading to-because of shorter distances-most marine transportation between the North Atlantic and the North Pacific going through the Arctic Ocean. This has important consequences for transportation, security, and natural resource use. The Arctic sea routes also hold geopolitical importance as alternative routes, for example, if conflicts at the Panama or Suez Canal interrupt intercontinental shipping. This gives added importance to the gates to the Arctic Ocean and surrounding nations. nan;CLIMATE-CHANGE","Interactive Effects of the CO2 Enrichment and Nitrogen Supply on the Biomass Accumulation, Gas Exchange Properties, and Mineral Elements Concentrations in Cucumber Plants at Different Growth Stages The concentration changes of mineral elements in plants at different CO2 concentrations ([CO2]) and nitrogen (N) supplies and the mechanisms which control such changes are not clear. Hydroponic trials on cucumber plants with three [CO2] (400, 625, and 1200 mu mol mol(-1)) and five N supply levels (2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 mmol L-1) were conducted. When plants were in high N supply, the increase in total biomass by elevated [CO2] was 51.7% and 70.1% at the seedling and initial fruiting stages, respectively. An increase in net photosynthetic rate (Pn) by more than 60%, a decrease in stomatal conductance (Gs) by 21.2-27.7%, and a decrease in transpiration rate (Tr) by 22.9-31.9% under elevated [CO2] were also observed. High N supplies could further improve the Pn and offset the decrease of Gs and Tr by elevated [CO2]. According to the mineral concentrations and the correlation results, we concluded the main factors affecting these changes. The dilution effect was the main factor driving the reduction of all mineral elements, whereas Tr also had a great impact on the decrease of [N], [K], [Ca], and [Mg] except [P]. In addition, the demand changes of N, Ca, and Mg influenced the corresponding element concentrations in cucumber plants. dry weight; N levels; elevated CO2; open-top chamber; nutrient transportation; photosynthesis; transpiration; dilution effect;CARBON-DIOXIDE ENRICHMENT; ELEVATED CO2; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACCLIMATION; NITRATE ASSIMILATION; NUTRIENT CONCENTRATION; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; USE EFFICIENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESPONSES","Evaluation of storm surge risk: A case study from Rarotonga, Cook Islands This study reports on a preliminary assessment of storm surge risk from tropical cyclones at Rarotonga, Cook Islands. Analysis of a 175-year record of cyclones from the Cook Islands indicates minimum annual probabilities of 16% for storm surges and 5% for major storm surge impacts at Rarotonga. Storm surges have historically inundated areas of the coastal lowland where virtually all human activities and infrastructure are currently located. The impacts of such events have been particularly severe in the Cook Islands capital of Avarua and adjacent communities on the north coast of Rarotonga. Detailed infrastructure mapping combined with analysis of historic storm surge impacts and cyclone tracks in the vicinity of Rarotonga indicates that the storm surge risk is greatest along the north coast where the majority of the Cook Islands' government functions and commercial, industrial, transportation and communication infrastructure is located. Damage to this infrastructure at the shoreline can have serious repercussions throughout the Cook Islands. Any efforts to increase the countrys resilience to such impacts must be undertaken within the larger goal of adaptation to future climate changes and rising sea levels. The greatest risk presently to human life arises from many cyclone safety centres in locations where they are exposed to storm surges or flooding. A top priority should be relocation of these shelters to safer locations further inland so that they can provide suitable shelter from storm surges and flooding as well as tsunamis, taking into account other hazards presented by Rarotonga's rugged topography.

Sea-level-rise in northern Java, Indonesia, has impacted coastal cities prone to flooding and inundation. This study reports the extent to which spatial planning, mandated by the Indonesian Law 26/2007 to minimise the risk of people and improve their resilience, has taken into account hydro-meteorological hazard of Semarang City in northern Java. Geographic Information System (GIS) based spatial analyses were used to predict the anticipated vulnerability of the area based on the combined effect of two processes, namely, a tendency towards land subsidence and an increase in sea level. Further, by overlaying the current and projected vulnerability maps to the year 2031 with the planned land use of the city in the same timeframes, results show that most precincts with anticipated flooding and inundation are residential, industrial, and commercial areas, indicating that the current spatial land use plan has not adequately accounted for the hazard. The methodology employed in this study should prove of use for other cities on the littoral.

They are of considerable value for drinking water supply and some springs are of historical and tourism value. However, increasing industrial and urban expansion has led to serious problems of overdraft of groundwater resources, which in turn had caused the disappearance of springs globally. Thus, the protection of springs while at the same time allowing for the use of local groundwater resources is an important task of water resources management. In this study, we propose a new multi-objective simulation and optimization (S/O) model to find an optimal extraction strategy which balances the competitive relationship between spring outflow and groundwater extraction. In the newly developed model, the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are taken as the decision variables, and maximization of groundwater extraction and maximization of spring outflow are taken as the two objective functions. Baotu Spring which is located in northern China has been famous since the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE). However, Baotu Spring has been drying up since the 1990s due to over extraction of the local groundwater. Thus, we take Baotu Spring as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model. Simultaneously, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the multi-objective fast harmony search algorithm (MOFHS) which is coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow code MODFLOW, is adopted to search the Pareto optimal solutions (the optimal extraction strategies). The optimization results of Baotu Spring field during the management period from July 2013 to June 2014 show that more groundwater resources could be extracted without threatening the sustainable outflow of Baotu Spring and Black Tiger Spring. The optimization results for different hydrological years show that climate variability (mainly in precipitation) is an important factor when choosing the optimal extraction strategy. The optimization results of Baotu Spring in northern China show that the newly developed model is a promising tool to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies which can protect springs while maximizing the extraction of groundwater resources in a spring field.

The probability of future flooding is estimated by extending observed hourly water level for 1927-2021 into hourly estimates until 2100. Unlike most other flood prediction methods, the approach here does not use any predetermined probability distribution function of extreme events, and instead a random sampling of past data represents tides and storm surges. The probability of flooding for 3 different flood levels and 3 different SLR projections are calculated, and the results are consistent with more sophisticated methods. Under intermediate-low SLR projection an empirical formula is found to estimate the lower bound of flooding time, showing that water level that exceeds the high tide (Mean Higher High Water, MHHW) occurred similar to 0.3% of the time in the 1960s, increased to similar to 6% in 2021, and projected to occur 100% of the time by similar to 2080. Under intermediate SLR projection, 1000 simulations of the probability of maximum annual water level were conducted, showing that storm surges may reach similar to 2 m over MHHW by 2050 and similar to 3 m over MHHW by 2100; in comparison, storm surges in Norfolk over the past 90 years reached 1.6 m only once. The method derived here could be adopted to other locations and help planning mitigations and adaptation strategies for cities at risk. sea level rise; coastal flooding; hurricanes; storm surge; tides; sea level projection;GULF-STREAM; EAST-COAST; IMPACT; VARIABILITY; EXTREME","Observation and Numerical Simulations with Radar and Surface Data Assimilation for Heavy Rainfall over Central Korea This study investigated the impact of multiple-Doppler radar data and surface data assimilation on forecasts of heavy rainfall over the central Korean Peninsula; the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational data assimilation system (3DVAR) were used for this purpose. During data assimilation, the WRF 3DVAR, cycling mode with incremental analysis updates (IAU) was used. A maximum rainfall of 335.0 mm occurred during a 12-h period from 2100 UTC 11 July 2006 to 0900 UTC 12 July 2006. Doppler radar data showed that the heavy rainfall was due to the back-building formation of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). New convective cells were continuously formed in the upstream region, which was characterized by a strong southwesterly low-level jet (LLJ). The LLJ also facilitated strong convergence due to horizontal wind shear, which resulted in maintenance of the storms. The assimilation of both multiple-Doppler radar and surface data improved the accuracy of precipitation forecasts and had a more positive impact on quantitative forecasting (QPF) than the assimilation of either radar data or surface data only. The back-building characteristic was successfully forecasted when the multiple-Doppler radar data and surface data were assimilated. In data assimilation experiments, the radar data helped forecast the development of convective storms responsible for heavy rainfall, and the surface data contributed to the occurrence of intensified low-level winds. The surface data played a significant role in enhancing the thermal gradient and modulating the planetary boundary layer of the model, which resulted in favorable conditions for convection. radar and surface data; data assimilation; mesoscale convective system; heavy rainfall;MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS; WEATHER RADAR; UNITED-STATES; PRECIPITATION; PENINSULA; PARAMETERIZATION; 3DVAR; LINES; SHEAR; BAND","Climate change and the opportunity cost of conflict A growing empirical literature associates climate anomalies with increased risk of violent conflict. This association has been portrayed as a bellwether of future societal instability as the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are predicted to increase. This paper investigates the theoretical foundation of this claim. A seminal microeconomic model of opportunity costs-a mechanism often thought to drive climate-conflict relationships- is extended by considering realistic changes in the distribution of climate-dependent agricultural income. Results advise caution in using empirical associations between short-run climate anomalies and conflicts to predict the effect of sustained shifts in climate regimes: Although war occurs in bad years, conflict may decrease if agents expect more frequent bad years. Theory suggests a nonmonotonic relation between climate variability and conflict that emerges as agents adapt and adjust their behavior to the new income distribution. We identify 3 measurable statistics of the income distribution that are each unambiguously associated with conflict likelihood. Jointly, these statistics offer a unique signature to distinguish opportunity costs from competing mechanisms that may relate climate anomalies to conflict. violence; agriculture; rainfall; income shock; microeconomic theory;ECONOMIC SHOCKS; CIVIL CONFLICT","Protected area stewardship in the Anthropocene: integrating science, law, and ethics to evaluate proposals for ecological restoration in wilderness Every year, the four federal agencies that manage designated wilderness in the United States receive proposals to implement small- and large-scale ecological restorations within the National Wilderness Preservation System. The combination of climate change with other landscape stressors is driving ecological restoration to be one of the single most important, challenging, and potentially litigious wilderness stewardship issues. In addition, different stakeholders may have strongly divergent views about what the right decision should be, and decisions need to go beyond routine technical and scientific analyses to incorporate a broader range of legal and ethical considerations. We present a framework based on a comprehensive, structured set of scientific, legal, and ethical questions to guide the evaluation of proposals for ecological restoration and other types of ecological intervention in wilderness. This framework of questions is a voluntary tool designed to increase communication and transparency among scientists, managers, and interested publics regarding the trade-offs and uncertainties of ecological restoration, and promote informed public deliberation in managing the public resource of wilderness. ecological restoration; ethics; intervention; natural; protected areas; stewardship; untrammeled; wilderness;MOUNTAIN LION PREDATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BIGHORN SHEEP; LAND-USE; MANAGEMENT; WILD; CONSERVATION; ASSUMPTIONS; THREATS; ERA","Sediment yield from gullies, riparian mass wasting and bank erosion in the Upper Konto catchment, East Java, Indonesia Upland watershed rehabilitation programmes in Indonesia have faced increased scrutiny for not delivering the desired reductions in downstream sedimentation rates. Partly this reflects the fact that conservation measures have not been widely adopted or maintained by upland farmers, mainly for socio-economic reasons. Another potential explanation is that sediment contributions by gullying, (riparian) mass wasting and bank erosion have been seriously underestimated or even ignored. This paper presents estimates of sediment contributions by gullies, riparian mass wasting and bank erosion in the upland volcanic Konto catchment, East Java. Runoff and sediment yield from gullies were studied in two areas with contrasting soils and land use. Gullies in the Maron area (few gullies, Andic Cambisols, maize and rice cultivation on stable broad-based terraces) were related to improper drainage of trails, roads and yards. In the Binangsri area (more widespread gullying, Eutric Cambisols, onion cultivation on forward-sloping terraces), gullying was further enhanced by the practice of downslope furrowing to promote field drainage. Estimated annual sediment yields from the two areas were strikingly different at 22-26 and 50-87 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Riparian mass wasting was estimated to contribute ca. 4% of total sediment yield at Maron and 8-19% in the main gully system at Binangsri, with the higher value in the latter case representing the effect of extreme rainfall in the latter half of the rainy season. Short-term wet season rates of gully wall retreat at Binangsri suggested a contribution by bank erosion of ca. 3% (8% including extreme events). As such, 11-27% of the annual sediment yield at Binangsri was estimated to have come from sources other than surface erosion. Substantial volumes of sediment (29-107 Mg km(-1) of river length) were also added to streams bordered by irrigated rice fields (sawah) in non-gullied areas, mainly through the collapse of the lowermost terraces due to undercutting.

Some understand it as a state-security issue, some take a protection (or human security) approach and yet others portray migration as an adaptation or climate risk management strategy. Yet we have little insight into how these different understandings of the 'problem' of climate change-related migration are beginning to shape the emergence of global governance in the climate regime. Through a focus on the UNFCCC Task Force on Displacement we argue that these different framings of climate change migration shape how actors understand the appropriate role of the TFD, including the substantive scope of its mandate; its operational priorities; the nature of its outputs and where it should be situated in the institutional architecture. We show that understanding the different framings of the nexus between climate change and migration - and how these framings are contested within the UNFCCC - can help to account for institutional development in this area of climate governance.

Optimization algorithm performance was compared for each of the available basin-model combinations. For each model-basin pair, 40 calibrations were run with the 10 algorithms. Results were tested for statistical significance using a multicomparison procedure based on Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A dispersion metric was used to evaluate the fitness landscape underlying the structure on each test case. The trials revealed that the dimensionality and general fitness landscape characteristics of the model calibration problem are important when considering the use of an automatic optimization method. The ASA, CMAES, and DDS algorithms were either as good as or better than the other methods for finding the lowest minimum, with ASA being consistently among the best. The SCE-UA method performs better when the model complexity is reduced, whereas the opposite is true for DDS. Convergence speed was also studied, and the same three methods (CMAES, DDS, and ASA) were shown to converge faster than the other methods. The SCE-UA method converged nearly as fast as the best methods when the model with the smallest parameter space was used but was not as worthy in the higher-dimension parameter space of the other models. Convergence speed has little impact on algorithm efficiency. The methods offering the worst performance were DE, CS, GA, HS, and PSO, although they did manage to find good local minima in some trials. However, the other available methods generally outperformed these algorithms. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

However, these studies are often limited by missing data, and suffer from the methodological limitation that important information is lost when we reduce textual information to quantitative data. This study was motivated by nine case studies that appeared to be inconsistent with the expectation that the presence of Ostrom's Design Principles increases the likelihood of successful common pool resource governance. These cases highlight the limitations of coding and analysing large-N case studies. We examine two issues: 1) the challenge of missing data and 2) potential approaches that rely on context (which is often lost in the coding process) to address inconsistencies between empirical observations and theoretical predictions. For the latter, we conduct a post-hoc qualitative analysis of a large-N comparative study to explore 2 types of inconsistencies: 1) cases where evidence for nearly all design principles was found, but available evidence led to the assessment that the CPR system was unsuccessful and 2) cases where the CPR system was deemed successful despite finding limited or no evidence for design principles. We describe inherent challenges to large-N comparative analysis and to coding complex and dynamically changing common pool resource systems for the presence or absence of design principles and the determination of ""success"". Finally, we illustrate how, in some cases, our qualitative analysis revealed that the identity of absent design principles explained inconsistencies, and hence reconciled such apparent inconsistencies with theoretical predictions. This analysis demonstrates the value of combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, and using mixed-methods approaches iteratively to build comprehensive methodological and theoretical approaches to understanding common pool resource governance in a dynamically changing context.

It is therefore apparent that a combined approach of mitigation and adaptation will be required to protect public health. While the importance of mitigation is recognised, this project focused on the role of adaptation strategies in addressing the potential health impacts of climate change. The nature and magnitude of these health impacts will be determined by a number of parameters that are dependent upon the location. Firstly, climate change will vary between regions. Secondly, the characteristics of each region in terms of population and the ability to adapt to changes will greatly influence the extent of the health impacts that are experienced now and into the future. Effective adaptation measures therefore need to be developed with these differences in mind. A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) framework was used to consider the implications of climate change on the health of the population of Western Australia (WA) and to develop a range of adaptive responses suited to WA. A broad range of stakeholders participated in the HIA process, providing informed input into developing an understanding of the potential health impacts and potential adaptation strategies from a diverse sector perspective. Potential health impacts were identified in relation to climate change predictions in WA in the year 2030. The risk associated with each of these impacts was assessed using a qualitative process that considered the consequences and the likelihood of the health impact occurring. Adaptations were then developed which could be used to mitigate the identified health impacts and provide responses which could be used by Government for future decision making. The periodic application of a HIA framework is seen as an ideal tool to develop appropriate adaptation strategies to address the potential health impacts of climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, MR sites have been recognised to have lower morphological variability and coverage of saltmarsh vegetation than natural saltmarsh sites, which have been linked with the legacy of the historic (terrestrial) land use. This study assesses the relationship between the morphology and vegetation coverage in three separate zones, associated with the legacy of historic reclamation, of a non-engineered MR site. The site was selected due to the phased historical reclamation, and because no pre-breaching landscaping or engineering works were carried out prior to the more recent and contemporary breaching of the site. Four vegetation indices (Excess Green Index, Green Chromatic Coordinate, Green-Red Vegetation Index, and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index) were calculated from unmanned aerial vehicle imagery; elevation, slope, and curvature surface models were calculated from a digital surface model (DSM) generated from the same imagery captured at the MR site. The imagery and DSM summarised the three zones present within the MR site and the adjacent external natural marsh, and were used to examine the site for areas of differing vegetation cover. Results indicated statistically significant differences between the vegetation indices across the three zones. Statistically significant differences in the vegetation indices were also found between the three zones and the external natural saltmarsh. However, it was only in the zone nearest the breach, and for three of the four indices, that a moderate to strong correlation was found between elevation and the vegetation indices (r = 0.53 to 0.70). This zone was also the lowest in elevation and exhibited the lowest average value for all indices. No relationship was found between the vegetation indices and either the slope or curvature in any of the zones. The approach outlined in this paper provides coastal managers with a relatively low-cost, low-field time method of assessing the areas of vegetation development in MR sites. Moreover, the findings indicate the potential importance of considering the historic morphological and sedimentological changes in the MR sites. By combining data on the areas of saltmarsh colonisation with a consideration of the site's morphological and reclamation history, the areas likely to support saltmarsh vegetation can be remotely identified in the design of larger engineered MR sites maximising the compensation for the loss of saltmarsh habitat elsewhere. managed realignment; unmanned aerial vehicle; coastal geomorphology; coastal wetlands;STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; SALT-MARSH; MANAGED REALIGNMENT; SEDIMENT STRUCTURE; DRAINAGE; IMPACT; INDEX","Land Use, Land Cover Change and Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture and Livestock in the Amazon and the Atlantic Forest in Brazil The Amazon and the Atlantic Forest are Brazilian biomes that suffered an intense land use and land cover change, marked by the loss of native forest and expansion of agriculture and livestock. This article aims to analyze land use and land cover change history and to propose a sustainable alternative for agriculture and livestock as an opportunity for rural development in these biomes. The statistics of the platform from the Annual Mapping Project for Land Use and Land Cover in Brazil (MapBiomas) were used in an annual historical series from 1985 to 2020. The analysis of land use and land cover changes indicates that the Amazon native forest was reduced by 44.53 million hectares (Mha), while pasture, agriculture and planted forest increased by 38.10, 6.06 and 0.26 Mha, respectively, over the 35 years (1985 to 2020). In the Atlantic Forest, for the same period, forest and pasture reduced by 0.99 and 11.53 Mha, respectively, while agriculture expanded by 8.06 Mha and planted forest by 2.99 Mha. Sustainable land use strategies, such as the Integration Crop-Livestock-Forest (ICLF), can support the increase in agricultural production while recovering and preserving the environment. Policies and programs should consider regional particularities and barriers for more significant adoption of this strategy. deforestation; sustainable development; Agroforestry; integration crop-livestock-forestry;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; PROTECTED AREAS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BEEF-CATTLE; DEFORESTATION; CROP; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; AGROFORESTRY","Spatio-temporal dynamics of soil moisture driven by 'Grain for Green' program on the Loess Plateau, China The continuous afforestation has led to significant changes in soil moisture (SM) dynamics on the Loess Plateau, China (LPC). However, evaluating the spatio-temporal distributions and driving factors of the SM changes following afforestation is challenging because of the difficulty of accessing areas and the lack of long-term series records. Here, we evaluated the accuracy of Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) SM product by comparing with in-situ SM data in LPC, and quantified the spatio-temporal variations of SM in different periods from 1982 to 2015 under the 'Grain for Green' program (GGP). The results showed that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was well matched with the SM variations in more than 46% area of LPC from 1982 to 2015, which mainly located at the vegetated areas. The variations of SM responding to re vegetation displayed obvious southeast-negative and northwest-positive patterns, which was the wet region (annual precipitation > 450 mm) to be dry and dry region (annual precipitation <= 450 mm) to be wet. Path coefficient value revealed that the positive effect of vegetation activity for grassland on SM was ascribed to its promotion on the occurrence of rainfall (mean path coefficient = 0.278). Precipitation played vital impact on the SM in bareland and sparsely vegetated area, and evapotranspiration played a dominant role in the SM dynamic of the forestland, especially at the early stage of GGP (From 2000 to 2010), while precipitation and NDVI had stronger effects than evapotranspiration on the SM dynamics of grassland. Our study suggests that in arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation achieves the optimal water retention capacity when the vegetation fractions are 1.4%-3.7% and 3.8%-7.2%, respectively. Hence, vegetation should not be further expanded in semi-humid areas, but should be further restored in arid and semi-arid areas with sparse or excessively sparse vegetation cover (especially in desert).

A total of 270 respondents were randomly selected from the three different cultivated areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, namely, Peshawar, Nowshera and Swat. Binary choice model was used in this study to categorise the IC's of peach farmers into adoption and non-adoption. The study identifies that socio-economic, institutional farm resources, and climatic factors are influencing the adoption of ICs of peach production. Results of the estimated model reveal that farmer's age, education, household size, membership, cell phone, farm size, extension services and the role of the non-government organization have a positive effect on adoption of ICs. In addition, farmer's experience, off-farm income, livestock and machinery ownership, credit access and inputs prices have a positive and significant impact on ICs adoption. Moreover, results of the logit model demonstrate that climatic related factors have a highly significant and positive impact on the adoption of ICs. These results suggested that institutional services should be strengthened to provide managerial and technical skills on ICs technology adoption and on time provision of financial services to enhance the productivity of peach farmers. improved cultivars; peach; technology; agriculture;AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS; EXTENSION","Environmental disasters and public-opinion formation: A natural experiment This study leverages the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident as natural experiment to determine the causal impact environmental disasters may have on the formation of environmental public opinion. Using Eurobarometer data on more than 60,000 individuals' attitudes toward environmental salience before and after the incident, I find that Fukushima had indeed a causal effect on whether people see the environment as a salient policy item. This impact is more strongly pronounced for what respondents think dominates the political agenda than for personal priorities. These results have important implications for the understanding of how public opinion about the environment is formed, and they have crucial consequences for the suspected link between policymaking and public opinion. environment; public opinion; natural experiment; Eurobarometer;FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR ACCIDENT; MEDIA COVERAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SUPPORT; GERMANY; POLICY; POWER","Sea-level rise in Indonesia: on adaptation priorities in the agricultural sector Adaptation to climate-change impacts requires understanding of where impacts are to be expected and what their magnitude may be. Adaptation funds are only a limited resource for helping affected parties in coping with climate-change impacts. The application of suitable methods helps to determine the recipients of adaptation aid. A quantification of impacts based on different impact analyses can aid in taking on various perspectives on the same problem in order to identify the appropriate perspective for the given decision-making context or for identifying impact patterns. Once executed, this prioritizes adaptation needs and finding a suitable allocation rule, given the policy makers perception of the decision-making context. The study introduces a set of methods of spatially explicit, sub-national (province level), and country-wide impact analyses regarding inundation impacts on agricultural areas for four important food crops in Indonesia. These methods are applied to a 1 and 2 m sea-level rise scenario and include a novel approach for impact analyses, data envelopment analysis, which is not widely used in environmental studies as of yet. Based on the given case study, the paper demonstrates the applicability of these methods and identifies impact patterns.

Though these debates have focused largely on the biophysical dimensions of climate change, human dimensions research is equally in need of improved methodological approaches for research synthesis. Systematic review approaches, and more recently realist review methods, have been used within the health sciences for decades to guide research synthesis. Despite this, penetration of these approaches into the social and environmental sciences has been limited. Here, we present an analysis of approaches for systematic review and research synthesis and examine their applicability in an adaptation context. Customized review frameworks informed by systematic approaches to research synthesis provide a conceptually appropriate and practical opportunity for increasing methodological transparency and rigor in synthesizing and tracking adaptation research. This review highlights innovative applications of systematic approaches, with a focus on the unique challenges of integrating multiple data sources and formats in reviewing climate change adaptation policy and practice. We present guidelines, key considerations, and recommendations for systematic review in the social sciences in general and adaptation research in particular. We conclude by calling for increased conceptual and methodological development of systematic review approaches to address the methodological challenges of synthesizing and tracking adaptation to climate change.

They reflect a tendency for city governments to coordinate environmental action through networked forms of governance. In this article, we argue that a new generation of TMNs has entered the global scene to help cities steer their efforts to handle environmental issues. In contrast to the characteristics of older TMNs as public, inclusive, and self-governed, new-generation TMNs are influenced by private actors, they are exclusive, and employ enforcement mechanisms to secure the fulfilment of network goals. To underline the diversity of TMNs and thus better understand urban networked governance, we present a case study of the 100 Resilient Cities initiative covering its conduct in 2013-2019. Looking at its actor composition and membership terms, we identify a hybrid nature different from the one described in earlier literature on European TMNs primarily. This subscription to a hybrid form of governance calls for a larger discussion on the implications of this shift in governance type and on the extent to which hybridisation implies a shift of power from the public to the private sphere.

We develop a real options model of adaptation to climate change, capturing the different effects of gradual changes, represented by a Brownian motion process, and extreme events, represented by Poisson jumps with a hyper-exponential jump size distribution. We compare adaptation decisions under the increased frequency, severity, and tail thickness of extreme events as well as gradual changes. We find that while the adaptation incentives are higher in response to gradual changes, the probability of carrying out adaptation activities is higher in response to extreme events. The catalyst effects of extreme events become more significant when the tail distribution of the extreme events becomes heavier. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. ","An alternative explanation for global trends in thermal tolerance Ectotherms from higher latitudes can generally perform over broader temperature ranges than tropical ectotherms. This pattern is thought to reflect trends in temperature variability: tropical ectotherms evolve to be 'thermal specialists' because their environment is thermally stable. However, the tropics are also hotter, and most physiological rates increase exponentially with temperature. Using a dataset spanning diverse ectotherms, we show that the temperature ranges ectotherms tolerate (the difference between lower and upper critical temperatures, and between optimum and upper critical temperatures) generally represents the same range of equivalent biological rates (e.g. metabolism) for cool-and warm-adapted species, and independent of latitude or elevation. This suggests that geographical trends in temperature variability may not be the ultimate mechanism underlying latitudinal and elevational trends in thermal tolerance. Rather, we propose that tropical ectotherms can perform over a narrower range of temperatures than species from higher latitudes because the tropics are hotter.
